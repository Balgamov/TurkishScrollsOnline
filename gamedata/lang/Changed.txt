{{265851556-0-7156:}}Urgarlag Chief-bane of the Undaunted has challenged me to explore Bedlam Veil.
{{265851556-0-1709:}}The Supernal Dreamers also took Ingride's daughter, <<1>>, and they're apparently planning a similar ritual using her as the vessel for some Daedric spirit. I promised Ingride I would stop them.
{{265851556-0-3744:}}Lord Stictal had a unique power crystal that was stolen by Supernal Dreamers. They have shattered the crystal in order to use the pieces for Daedric summoning ritual.

{{200879108-0-7558:}}"Seeing the blood-pacts made by the Ayleidoons with the Daedra, the Aedra having left the races of Cyrod to their own machinations, descended unto the plane of mortality and, seeking that virtue most akin to their own nature, did appear to … "
{{200879108-0-14235:}}They're Daedric cultists of some stripe or another. To be honest, I can't be bothered to distinguish them. \n\nBut they're going to use the shards of the Crystal of Power for a Daedric summoning ritual, and that's all you need to worry about right now.
{{200879108-0-74715:}}Is that a threat? Because it's very convincing. You're not going to punch me, are you?\n\nYou know what? How about I just leave you alone? Yes, yes, I'll just go off this way and you can leave me alone? That sounds good. Let's do that.
{{200879108-0-20521:}}It will not be easy, and you will need to move quickly, but it can be done.\n\nYou will need to reverse the Daedric ritual, which will require gathering a few … somewhat grisly items. Then you must follow the directions exactly to break the spell.
{{200879108-0-20522:}}The Supernal Dreamers have put her into an enchanted sleep, tied down in front of a portal—undoubtedly from Vaermina's dark domain. They will summon a Daedric spirit to inhabit Ingride's body.\n\nYou need to break the enchantment to free her.
{{200879108-0-14253:}}Because they're Daedric cultists, and everyone needs a hobby.
{{200879108-0-28399:}}The Mane, he's here. Some of the quickblades reported seeing him appear in a ball of shadowstuff, and bending a knee to Lavinia. He's been corrupted somehow. Akkhuz-ri has always been a good and kind man.
{{200879108-0-4604:}}The Supernal Dreamers are a plague on the land. I had never heard of them… until they overran my father's farm.\n\nMother Helene is the cult leader for this circle of cultists. She gave them the order to attack our farm.
{{200879108-0-47873:}}I would. Ninave prefers to be near family, in Balmora.\n\nDon't tell my wife, but Seythen was interested in exploring Daedric shrines. I know he was studying Esutanamus. Bit east of here.
{{200879108-0-41823:}}If the alternative is to remain trapped in this city, watching my friends die over and over? Yes, I'd prefer a real death. Alas, duty calls.\n\nI'm going to take as many Daedra with me as I can. And as much as I hate this curse, I hate them even more.
{{200879108-0-51925:}}The Ritemaster contacts me from time to time. The Psijics have magic that is well beyond what the wyresses can accomplish.\n\nHe asks me questions and I tell him things about happenings in the world. I suppose he feels isolated on his hidden island.
{{200879108-0-49439:}}You plan to do what? Oh dear. Well, this seems like a terrible idea, but I shall rely upon you and Lord Fyr to protect me.\n\nHere's a list of the components I'll need. Once you've acquired them, meet me in the Hall of Refined Techniques. Good luck!
{{200879108-0-74723:}}Three. Eldertide, Stonelore, and Firesong. Stonelore are adequate druids, but they stay close to betraying the True Way. Accepting outsiders? Pah!\n\nThe Firesong are reclusive, but they never attacked other druids before.
{{200879108-0-63243:}}Yes. We decided to distinguish it from other coursework. Plucking arrowheads out of the grass on an ancient battlefield is one thing. Searching a Nord barrow for a Dragon Priest's slippers? That's something else.\n\nYou can attest to that, I wager.
{{200879108-0-4624:}}You will need to acquire the hearts of two different Daedra. A Scamp and a Dremora should do. Then find my ritual candle in the Vannes' barn.\n\nTake the items to where Ingride lies in the Stonebridge Mill, and there you will perform the ritual.
{{200879108-0-78885:}}A polearm put under the Oathsworn's protection by Malacath eons ago. Beyond that, it's a mystery.\n\nIf the Recollection took it, killing everyone in the pit would be a good way to hide the truth. This may be more important than we know.
{{200879108-0-54473:}}Just over three years at this point. I'll admit, it takes some getting used to, but once—ow! Sorry. Once you settle in, you'll never want to leave!
{{200879108-0-12531:}}The crystal appeared to me in a dream, held aloft by a Daedric lord. He claimed it was a gift and that it was a part of my destiny. When I awoke I found the thing in my lap!
{{200879108-0-12539:}}I showed the coffer to my wizard and he said they were Daedric symbols, though he did not understand their meaning.
{{200879108-0-25948:}}I'm starting over. I need to gather some funds, and then I'll rebuild the Quickstep Bandits. I'll be more careful this time, keep things quieter. We'll jump the Black Daggers as soon as I've got enough folks with me. They're all going to die!
{{200879108-0-13238:}}Aside from the fact that she is utterly mad? She came to receive the blessing of Saint Veloth himself. The Saint told her she was doing evil, not good. \n\nShe flew into a rage, smashed the reliquary and opened the Daedric portals.
{{200879108-0-18394:}}Firsthold is where High Kinlord Rilis XIII rules over Auridon. While Skywatch is the capital, he's chosen to stay here due to the close proximity of his ancestral family home, Castle Rilis.
{{200879108-0-71493:}}Peace conference? Is that what this is all about? \n\nZa'ji received orders from the crown. Probably because of our reputation as Dragon slayers. And smugglers. We're good at that, too.
{{200879108-0-78588:}}Prince Ithelia is the Mistress of the Untraveled Road—she could be anywhere. Perhaps she will be drawn to places or things she knew before her craven foes locked her away.\n\nYes, that must be right. And I know what I must do. Farewell, mortal.

{{21337012-0-7762:}}By Arsyn Herandus\n\nTo be a kwama farmer in Necrom is to be among the exalted few trusted with preparing kwama properly for funerary rites and accoutrements. I'd say that my mother left me with this responsibility, but to be fair, I think I took it from her.\n\nOh, she was fine with that. She's off visiting other lands now and discovering something new and terrible about each. (I should strike this foreword. Or is it forward? I don't know. Maybe I should save up to pay for a fancy scribe to rewrite me. Anyway, keep going. This must be documented somewhere.)\n\nSCRIBS\nThese larval form of kwama have several uses unique to Necrom. First, though, you need to make sure whatever enclosure you put them in can contain them. They're sneaky little things.\n\nGrind up the joints of their legs to make sprinkling dust. Sprinkling dust is used by some visitors—mainly Hlaalu—on the candles around their ancestors to create a brief flash of glittery light. I use a special mortar and pestle crafted from rubedite for this purpose. The dust must be freshly ground or it won't work.\n\nIf you feed scribs a steady diet of toadstools, you're priming their jelly for use in food-based offerings. Mix a spoonful of fresh jelly into whatever you're cooking or baking for ancestors, and your offering will remain fresh for several days. I do not advise eating these offerings yourself, especially if you're an Argonian. That's about two days of pain you don't want to exist through again, from what I've seen. And, again, the jelly must be freshly made or it won't mix well with your dry ingredients. (No, I still don't know why toadstools. Must be an alchemical thing. Maybe find out for draft six?)\n\nMaybe I should specify that the food needs to be of our people. Don't expect your fondue recipe from Elsweyr to work with this. I don't care if your Redoran grandmother adapted it to use ingredients from Molag Mar.\n\nKWAMA WORKERS\nThese kwama just want to do their jobs. Don't let them. Keep them well-contained within a pen. If you have a couple of live scribs nearby, they'll settle into a routine of sorts. Along with all the usual uses these creatures have, we have a couple that are Necrom-specific.\n\nThe Telvanni prefer to have any offerings for their ancestors presented on a freshly crafted tray made from one of our workers. There's a specific cut I make while working with the carapace that leaves the inner abdominal veil intact. I wrap that veil gently around the carapace before an artisan starts working with it. They let the veil dry on the carapace after treating it with some alchemical reagent, which ultimately lends the carapace-tray a metallic sheen. Then they etch their patron's requested art into that layer. Some trays get quite ornate! One of my miners asked to have a kwama queen surrounded by eggs, scribs, workers, foragers, and, of course, warriors. He died while protecting his mine, so it seemed fitting. (I probably don't need to discuss Ol' Marzy in here, either, I guess. So, noting for deletion from the final manuscript.) \n\nWhen rendered properly, kwama cuttle can be crafted into one of the many candles you see around Necrom. After I harvest a kwama worker, I set aside the cuttle for one of Necrom's Keeper of the Dead chandlers. They need it freshly harvested so that they can mix in the proper herbs and alchemical agents. Because of this processing, the candles in Necrom last much longer than average candles. They also don't smoke or gutter. Plus they have a nice scent. Like fresh scrib jelly mixed with a vibrant sunset. Before you ask, no, they're not for sale. The Dead Keepers around here make them and keep the formula and process secret. (And, really? What does a vibrant sunset smell like? Mark that for deletion in draft six.)\n\nAnd, of course, I can perform all those other more mundane aspects of kwama harvesting, but only after I provide Necrom and its visitors with the items above as needed.\n\nAs for where I get these lovely little creatures, they come from several mines, all scheduled perfectly to provide me with a balance of workers and scribs for my next day's work. If Necrom's need is great, we can get more in, provided the mines are well stocked.\n\n(Definitely don't keep this part in draft six, but it came to me after I sold some scrib jelly and I needed to write it down somewhere:)\n\nThe jelly of scrib\nDivine, divine\nInto my belly\nAll mine, all mine.\n\nYour chittering ways\nSublime, sublime\nTease deep my heart\nNear all the time.\n\nCome here, my dear\nAnd fill my days\nWith darting moves\nAnd carefree gaze.\n\nThe wonder of scrib\nDivine, divine\nInto my belly\nAll mine, all mine.

Nothing but weak, indolent fools who play at being mages. \n\nThat oaf Hallgrod, a hireling who should by all accounts be swiftly expelled from his position to give room to those who rightly deserve a position. How he even got the position under Spellwright Varsva is a mystery that Sotha Sil himself could not unravel.\n\nSniveling Balver, always whining, a cretinous retainer who thinks his scheming goes unnoticed, but not by my watchful eyes. Not when his back is turned and he thinks he's safe, no. I observe his every movement and know of his plots. Worst of all, he reeks of some pungent stink.\n\nThen there's Oathman Llaro, a churlish upstart who will sooner than later fall. He may hold rank for a short time but sooner rather than later he will err and I will capitalize on his hubris.\n\nSpellwrights Varsva and Moran will see that I am more worthy than all of those before, these imbeciles, and that even though my ability to weave magic may leave something to be desired, I'm still a servant whose ambitions surpass even the highest of magisters. I alone can maneuver the ranks, and I find openings where they are left open for me, and create my opportunities where at first they may have appeared invisible to those untrained.\n\nThe magisters will soon see the talent they've overlooked and what a sharp mind and deft hand can bring for them. If only I can get my opening.
{{21337012-0-2656:}}A Report Prepared for the Star-Gazers\nBy Valinka Stoneheaver\n\nI finally got a chance to use one of the simple tricks my mentor—the famed explorer and adventurer, Narsis Dren—taught me. Turns out, if you dress in the same outfit as the people around you, keep your head low, and act like you belong, you can infiltrate even one of the most evil and dastardly cults currently operating in Craglorn. Even so, it wasn't easy. And I felt for sure that I was going to be revealed as a spy every moment I was there. But I snuck inside and emerged again to tell the tale. Barely! So, let me tell you about life in the Scaled Court—at least, life as I saw it for about four hours last Middas.\n\nFor the most part, life in the Scaled Court camp was much like what you'd expect in any gathering of rough-and-tumble fighters and mages. There was the usual good-natured banter among people who lived, worked, and fought side-by-side. There were a number of harsher words exchanged, too, showing that not everyone in the cult always gets along. But they had a singularity of purpose. The members of the Scaled Court that I interacted with were dedicated to their leaders, their god, and their cause. It was scary, how devoted to the Serpent these men and women seemed to be.\n\nOne young man, a former bandit from Rivenspire, was particularly enamored with the leaders of the Scaled Court. He seemed to be particularly intrigued by the highfalutin (in my opinion) and grandiose titles and affectations the leaders assigned to themselves. It starts at the very top, with the council of regents who apparently control the organization. I never got to meet any of the regents, but most were spoken of with admiration and awe. I believe that some of them hold positions in the hearts of the Scaled Court almost as revered as the Celestial Serpent himself. \n\nThere seemed to be some disagreement as to the wisdom of making the Iron Orc chieftain the Ophidian Exarch of Undulating Destruction. No one could fault that the addition of the Iron Orcs to the Scaled Court's ranks was an inspired idea, but instituting the brutish Braadoth into the highest echelons of the Serpent's forces in Upper Craglorn was not sitting well with everyone in camp. I gathered this opinion in fits and starts, by interpreting asides and whispers, and pressing the most upset members for whatever additional information they were willing to share. Even so, no one I met wanted to challenge the Ophidian Exarch or the other regents, so the Orc chieftain's promotion stands.\n\nOther leadership positions in the Scaled Court include the Regent of Wriggling Nightmares (who seems to be involved in crafting monsters loyal to the Serpent), the Regent of Fanged Fury, the Vizier of Slithering Visions, and a woman named Cassipia, who they called the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems. An entirely different chain of command was in place in Lower Craglorn. I never encountered any of these pompously titled individuals. And that's probably a good thing, as I'm not sure my disguise would have fooled them.\n\nI spent the rest of my time in the camp wandering around and listening to conversations, watching men and women perform the multitude of mundane tasks that fill the day at any military camp. (And make no mistake—the Scaled Court is as military an organization as any I've ever encountered!) I heard mention of some unidentified substance that seemed important to the Scaled Court, but I could never determine exactly what it was. Perhaps someone in the Star-Gazers has heard of it. They referred to it as "nirncrux dust." Whatever the substance is used for, the Scaled Court seems to consider it vital to their plans.\n\nDuring my final hour in the camp, I began to get the distinct impression that I was being watched. Immediately alert, I scanned the area for any sign that I had been recognized as the outsider I was. However, no one was raising an alert. No one was rushing toward me. But the feeling persisted, and I decided I had overstayed my welcome. I started to disengage from the group and slowly make my way to the edge of the camp when a band of Iron Orcs wandered in. If the sight of them made my blood run cold, my first view of the armored troll that accompanied them froze the blood in my veins.\n\nThe troll wore strange armor of Orcish design, run through with glyphs that made me want to look away (although maybe that was just the fear the creature inspired in me). I could have sworn it turned to study me, but then it was pulled along by its Orc masters and I had a clear path out of the camp. Before I reached the freedom I so desperately desired, however, I felt a hand gently grip my shoulder. I tensed, let out a few deep breaths to steady my nerves, and turned to face whoever had found me out.\n\nI was looking at a young Wood Elf with piercing eyes. She smiled, not unkindly, and handed me a folded piece of paper. "You're nice," she said. Then she turned away, leaving me to depart without further incident. I must have walked for an hour or more before I finally slowed and rested my weary back against a large, cool boulder. I sank to the ground and unfolded the piece of paper. It contained five short words.\n\n"Tell them what you saw."\n\nI dropped the paper and ran, sure that the howling hordes of the Scaled Court were chasing on my heels. But I made it back to Belkarth without any problems and wrote this report while it was still fresh in my mind. So fresh, in fact, that I'll probably have nightmares.
{{21337012-0-6919:}}Notes passed between Gleaners of a certain standing. (Read: Stolen from each other. Do not be offended when this happens. It is the nature of these notes) Collected into this tome by Haryfire, to pass along his knowledge and wisdom to his replacement in the organization.\n\n* * *\nElzig,\n\nWhere to start with Pieron Desant, our beloved leader? Well, on the one hand, the man never confirms anything. In fact, anything he does admit to can probably be written off as a complete lie. The little I know about him and how he came to Fargrave derives from information gleaned from multiple Dremora and Spiderkith associates of his. They say that he stole the secret of the Fargrave portal from a kynreeve. And that it was over a fortnight before anyone even knew who he was or that he was out of place. When they finally caught him, he had a large enough store of treasure confiscated from across Fargrave and from the Grasp that they had to let him stay or risk losing face to this master criminal who happened to be a mortal.\n\nHaryfire\n\n* * *\nHaryfire,\n\nSuch gak, the likes of which this one has never had the misfortune to read! The Grasp of the Stricture do not keep treasure. Pieron came to Fargrave as an escaped sacrifice from some cult. This one cannot remember the name. This one does know that the few surviving cult members still search for him. They promised his blood to Sanguine and will not rest until they fulfill their oath. That is why Pieron does not return to Nirn. He fears the cult leaders will find him the instant he steps through a portal.\n\nElzig\n\n* * *\nElzig,\n\nWhat are you talking about, cat? Saying Pieron doesn't go to Nirn? He just returned from High Isle with an amazing haul, you fobbing lout! As for the Grasp, have you considered that the reason they don't keep treasure anymore is because of our light-fingered leader? I suppose not. That would presume your mind actually worked better than a broken Dwemer spider. It was also incredibly easy to steal that letter from you, Elzig. You won't see this note to read that, but I want others to know. \n\nAs for Pieron, I can't understand why you would be so stupid as to put down your theories on paper. Pieron is the greatest Gleaner ever to prowl the Bazaar. He's going to steal this scrap the moment he learns of its existence. Stop being daft!\n\nStephanie Laffoon\n\n* * *\nTo whoever these letters go to next,\n\nI'd always heard that Pieron was not even mortal. He's a Daedra who escaped from his realm and set forth to amass the greatest treasure hoard in Oblivion. That's why he never ages or suffers any injury. That's what I heard, anyway.\n\nWih-Ja\n\n* * *\n\nWih-Ja,\n\nNonsense. There's no way that the first Gleaner in Fargrave was the same Pieron who oversees our business today. He would have to be of Mer blood for that to be the case. No, Pieron is his family name. The male heirs of the line remain in hiding while they are taught the ways of their fathers before one of them inherits the mantle of Pieron Desant when they are capable of growing sufficiently mature facial hair. That's why Pieron's hair changes drastically every fifty years or so. And that's the truth!\n\nGalunferion\n\n* * *\nAll,\n\nNone of these outlandish theories are true. Unless they are.\n\nPD\n\n* * *\nPieron, \n\nYour spine holds no shame.\n\nThreads-the-Stars\n\n* * *\nAll,\n\nI'm not sure who will believe me, but these notes never left my possession.

How did they both add to the pile while my head rested firmly atop this pillow? How? \n\nGalunferion
{{21337012-0-7454:}}A Report by Ordinator Kilao.\n\nAs you know, we Ordinators of the Tribunal Temple do not take heresy lightly. When word reached us that a new Daedric cult was attempting to gain a foothold in the Telvanni Peninsula, I was immediately dispatched to assess the situation. Of course, operating in lands under the sway of House Telvanni is never easy in the best of circumstances, but something has made the reticent masters of the house even more uncooperative than usual.\n\nAfter a few days of getting nowhere, I finally encountered a Breton by the name of Filbert Cienne while investigating Necrom. Before I could even ask a single question, he actually started to preach to me about the wonders of Peryite, Prince of Pestilence. He seemed to have no idea that I was an Ordinator, or even what that meant. I decided to listen and ask some questions of my own, since he was more than happy to discuss his heresy with me.\n\nI listened to him drone on about the wonders of pox and disease. He was actually trying to recruit me, to convince me to join his cult of sickness and vermin. When I could squeeze a word in edgewise, I asked him if he was part of the new Daedric cult I had heard about.\n\n"Oh, you must mean the Hidden Kindred," he said with some trepidation. "It's sort of a loose association of cultists loyal to two different Princes. My small branch of dedicated divine skeever followers was summoned to participate, but we decided to forgo taking part. There's just me, you see, and I'm not find of violence. I say sneeze and let sneeze, and all that."\n\nWhile the cultists confounded me with his inane rambling, I finally got him to reveal a few pertinent details about this so called Hidden Kindred order. He said they consist of an equal number of Peryite and Vaermina followers, those loyal to the Princes of Disease and Dreams. A high priest of Peryite who calls himself Blightcrown leads the combined forces, and Filbert claims that while he doesn't know the details, he's sure they have plans to do something unsavory in the region.\n\nBefore I could ask him more questions or arrest him for heresy, a procession of pilgrims headed toward the Necropolis suddenly filled the square. In the press of bodies, I lost sight of the Peryite cultist. While I don't consider this Filbert Cienne to pose much of a threat to the Tribunal, what he told me about the Hidden Kindred gives me pause. A joint force consisting of followers of two Daedric Princes operating in the Telvanni Peninsula cannot be a good thing.\n\nI shall continue to investigate and report my findings as soon as I am able.
{{21337012-0-3152:}}On the Nature of Tel Var Stones, Vol. IV\nby Herminius Sophus\nThe Conclusive Nature of Tel Var Stones:\n\nThe first thing to be gleaned from this weighty work, is a keen grasp of the connection between the Tel Var Stones themselves and the many unique applications of Magic. Physically, they appear to be unblemished stones of undeniable magical radiance—but when examined by an educated mind, it is clear that they are somehow imbued with more magical power than any other such objects that have yet been studied. One could speculate that the Ayleids could not produce such power themselves, so perhaps they mined these stones without substantial modification from a long emptied quarry of magical concentrate. Or perhaps they tapped into a nexus of interwoven magical threads from beyond Nirn. Or perhaps they created this material from the works, or even corpses, of long deceased scholars. All of these hypotheses are just that, and should not be considered fact without further evidence. The methods described within Volume 2 are but one way of discovering the effluvia of Magic mixt with the Stone. There may still be others. Dwemer contraptions designed to investigate such magical phenomena are known to have once existed. An instrument of such technological sophistication might yield more data concerning the origin of these Tel Var Stones, and ultimately how these Stones may be useful for further academic experimentation.

They were talking about which of them had the stronger will and could force the dice to roll in their favor. There were many promises of dismemberment, as I recall, but the thing that stood out to me was the implication that these Xivilai could influence and control the roll of an admittedly strange set of dice. (Assuming, as always, that that is what they were.) If they could force the dice to move without touching them, what else could they exert their will upon? \n\nI raced back to my study and began working through the possibilities until I reached this conclusion: Daedra do not move their corporeal forms in the ways that mortals do. Instead, their consciousness floats adjacent to their bodies, allowing them to influence the body or another object as they please. This explains how Daedra are vanquished and not killed. How they are able to move with the skill and grace heretofore unavailable to mortals. It even explains how Watchers can float without the use of wings! Lesser scholars will say that the latter point is facilitated through the use of magic, but that is too easy an explanation.\n\nAnother of my many great discoveries indicates that Dremora are the only strictly herbivorous Daedra. They do not need to ingest food stuffs in order to maintain their existence, but consuming flesh of any sort results in internal distress. The level of pain they experience makes many Dremora reconsider their current experiences and voluntarily return to Oblivion in the hopes that they will reform in a less pain-filled state. \n\nFinally, Daedric intelligence is not correlated to the intelligence of the Prince they serve. Now this may not seem that unusual, as the most foolish of mortal rulers often receive guidance from highly intelligent advisors. When Daedra serve a Prince whose portfolio includes such concepts as knowledge or cunning, it would seem illogical to have a Scamp command a more-intelligent Skaafin. However, this is precisely the situation I observed. I will not divulge actual names—that would be cruel and not very scholarly—but I have observed a Skaafin who allowed himself to be led by a Scamp. The Scamp chattered away at a fast pace and appeared to be making many good points while the Skaafin trudged dutifully behind. \n\nThese findings will be expanded upon later, as I am still conducting experiments and recording additional observations on Daedric behavior. I, to the best of my knowledge, am the only Daedrologist who follows a purely scientific method of information gathering. I rely on no input from the Daedra I study, as they cannot be trusted to report truths or remain objective. As such, my discoveries tend to be a long time in the making, but of exceptional quality. Due to my unique methods and the number of staggering discoveries I have made, I can say that I am the foremost scholar in this field. You wouldn't get truths like this from Pelagius Habor, would you?

Every cat feels the tug of the tides, the rhythm of the Two Moons Dance that cannot be ignored.\n\nBut not every cat hears the words Jone and Jode whisper as they prowl the celestial barrens between gentle Nirni and the Dark Behind the World, protecting her from the howling in the emptiness. And this is why the Moon-Bishop leads the kittens, trailing the string of secrets as he trots ahead, teaching them of the Motions and the Tides.\n\nA true cat hunts without rest for the Right Trail, trying one after another of the endless paths Jone and Jode dance into the sky even when paws ache and throats cry for milk. They have worn more trails than there are grains of sugar in all the world, and it is easy for a cat to grow bored and abandon the chase. This is why the Moon-Bishop inspires the kittens, sharing stories of the oldest times, nudging them back to the hunt.\n\nEvery cat longs for the Sands Behind the Stars, where sugar forms the dunes. Every cat dreams of the Moonlight Chorus, the joyous sound the true cats know.\n\nBut not every cat will know Khenarthi's tender embrace at the end of their days, and not every soul will fly beyond to bask in the Warmth Without End. This is why the Moon-Bishop must rebuke the naughty cats, swatting the ones who stray upon their flanks until they return to the paths the Moons weave.\n\nA true cat may stumble, may lose his way among the deep woods and come upon the temptations of a darker dance led by the Frightful Heart.

{{21337012-0-810:}}By Alla Llaleth\n\nThe Wheel of Time turns: in the dawn, it was the day of the Aldmeri, and then came the time of Men—but now, as the decay and chaos in the Empire makes clear, the time of Men has passed. Of the Men of Tamriel, only the Eastern Nords had the strength of character to join Dunmeri and Argonians in repelling the recent invasion of Snake-Men from Akavir, thereby showing that of all Men, only they may be trusted.\n\nTime and again Men have shown that without proper guidance, their meddling with External Powers leads to disaster. Men's reckless dabbling with beings beyond Nirn must stop forever. Now it is the time of the Ebonheart Pact, which shall and must become the Tamriel Pact. Within the Pact, the Aedra, Daedra, and Hist are all revered … from an appropriate distance. Within the Pact is the Tribunal, three Living Gods who abide among us here on Nirn and whose interest therefore coincides with that of all residents of Nirn. Only they have shown how to treat successfully with powers beyond Nirn.\n\nThe rash actions of those who sit on the Ruby Throne, or who pull their strings, have brought Tamriel to the verge of irretrievable doom. They must be scoured from the face of Cyrodiil, and the decaying remains of the Empire of Men must be swept away. It shall be replaced by the Pact, which will enforce peace across the continent and strictly regulate all involvement in dangerous magical pursuits.\n\nOnward, warriors of the Pact! We will never know peace and freedom until we occupy White-Gold Tower!
{{21337012-0-7462:}}By Severia Quasitto, renowned traveler.\n\nThe first course of the meal consisted of a trio of wickwheat crackers, as eaten by the clergy of the Temple Canton in Vivec City. Each cracker received its own topping: a whipped guar-milk ganache for the Mother of Mercy, a spear of bittergrass for the Warrior-Poet, and a lard-like oil that, I am told, symbolized the machinery lubricant of the Father of Mysteries.\n\nOur appetites having been whetted, the second course featured small dumplings in a sour gravy. The dumplings were made of ash-yams, each selected for their sweetness, that had been roasted, peeled, and pureed. Fermented saltrice, which I am told are grown in the lands surrounding Tear, was then ground into a flour which was mixed with the ash yam puree and boiled in the gravy. The sweet dumpling and sour sauce make for a delicious dessert, but an altogether unorthodox second course.\n\nThe third course was salad. Fennel, I believe, was piled onto each plate. I was rather unimpressed, but I was proven to be too impatient—one of my hosts soon ladled a quite piquant sauce over the sorry plate of vegetables. The sauce seemed to be primarily an oil-based decoction, for the servings that came from the bottom of the jug contained several small, chitinous bits that resembled lice. I asked, altogether too hopefully, if the bits were the withered remains of hot pepper—I had seen oils prepared from hot pepper on Cybiades and found the idea much more appetizing than the alternative. My question went unanswered.\n\nThe fourth, fifth and sixth courses were brought out simultaneously, in honor of the Tribunal—one course to honor each of the Living Gods, and none to take precedence (nor, I am told, gut-space) from the others. They were each magnificent in their own way.\n\nThe first dish I sampled came from a platter of steamed kwama scrib. Each guest received their own and, by some strange culinary alchemy, the hard shells of these creatures had been rendered as soft as jelly. I am told that the secret to this preparation involves blanching the creatures in solutions derived from the eluvium of Red Mountain. My hosts were quick to note that they had blanched each scrib over a dozen times in the solution to achieve such a tender carapace. I was also assured the procedure makes for an excruciating ordeal for the scribs. While I found that detail distressing, it apparently makes the meat much sweeter.\n\nThe second dish featured a number of kagouti sweetbreads. This is something of a misappellation on my part, for I couldn't make out the name of the dish even though it had been mentioned to me several times. Suffice it to say that, as with the sweetbreads of a creature such as a sheep, we were presented with several different glands of a kagouti. To each was ascribed a virtue in the manner of the Warrior-Poet. These, too, I cannot recollect adequately, but it was more due to my disdain for the Dunmer's vainglorious Living God than any complication of the Dark Elf language. \n\nThe final dish struck me as more performative than not. Eels, freshly killed, were filleted and set before us along with small basins of a caramel-colored brine that had been made from fermented marshmerrow. I watched my hosts as they carefully dipped their fingers into this brine and allowed drops to roll off their hands, falling upon the flesh of the eels. How the creatures contorted! They writhed and wriggled as though they were still very much alive (though the lack of heads assured me to the contrary). The creatures' unnatural movement soon subsided as, most curiously, the flesh of the eel became cured by the brine. How this honored Sotha Sil I didn't quite understand. Probably a cultural thing.
{{21337012-0-7795:}}2E 304, Abecean Sea.\n\nAt the rate at which my crew is shrinking, I doubt anything of our accursed and ill-fated voyage will survive beyond this record. Tu' whacca, give us the strength to avoid such a fate. \n\nFor all the days I neglected to write the happenings on my ship, I'll recount the major events.\n\nWe set sail from Summerset and headed east across the waters. A fierce wind kept our sails filled and our course calculations has us making landfall in Khefrem a week early. The crew rejoiced, for our time at sea was long and everyone was eager to sail in familiar waters once again. The sun was high, and no other sails or storms were visible from the crow's-nest. Everything was calm and idyllic. Tava looked upon us favorably. Or so we thought.\n\nWe awoke one morning to find ourselves trapped in the clear eye of a storm. A league on either side was dark clouds and troubled seas. But we rested in a windless pocket of clear skies and calm waters. At first, we thought it was a Sea Elf raid. The crew spent three nights armed and prepared for battle. They slept in shifts and got little rest at that. When no ships broke the storm clouds and no wind filled our sail, we thought of the Daedra and wondered if we somehow drew the attention of their frightful number. Still, with our stores emptying every day, we could not wait to starve. I ordered all rested hands to put oar to water. If the winds would not propel us to Stros M'kai, we would do it ourselves. That was my mistake.\n\nThe moment the first oar breached the still ocean waters the sea grew violent. It rippled and roiled with the bodies of a hundred sea adders. Their thick serpentine bodies lashed out and leaped onto the deck. Those with oars in their hands suffered the greatest, for the oars were too long to be used in combat. And those below deck, resting after their shifts of watching for Sea Elves had little time to gather themselves before the adders found the stairs. Somehow, we managed to slay the adders, but it was with heavy losses. The waters were still once more, and the boson ordered a day of rest to tend to and care for those who remained on this side of the Far Shores.\n\nThe night was filled with the song of pain from below deck and rest was sparse. Still, the morning broke with clouded skies and a great cheer arose. The sun rose in the sky and the winds rose with it. Finally, the doldrum we were caught in dissipated and the sails dragged what remained of my battered crew from those accursed waters.\n\nI thought that would be the end of our troubles, but while the wind returned, the storms did not dissipate. We sailed into their midst and, with a sizably smaller crew, we set out to battle the worst squall I have been unlucky enough to see. \n\nTwo experienced sailors pushed overboard by the arms of imps who careened out from the clouds. We lost their cries below the waves as we struggled to defend ourselves against tempest and imp. The call to arms erupted from all sides as the imps fell on us and my daring crew protected their stations and somehow kept the ship to rights before the imps fell back. \n\nWe cheered and cursed the clouds around us with equal fervor, doing our best to concentrate on battling the winds and not look about for more attackers. None came, that we saw, but the storm had worse for us in mind. When we least expected it, the lightning fell. Circular and swirling, unlike any I ever encountered. The crew let out a horrid cry as they saw great, hulking figures before us. Creatures of stone and storm who hurled tremendous energy at our vessel. \n\nStill, we had no way to avoid them. My ship was quick, but she can't outrun the wind. Her deck is sleek, but she can't turn from lightning. We fought to keep her from tearing herself apart, there was nothing more we could do. And so, my brave crew, half of the sailors who remained, stood at their posts and performed their duties until such time as the lightning drained the life from their arms. \n\nI was the worst captain in the seas. In two days, I'd lost over half of my crew to unforeseen creatures. Each time we were attacked, I rushed to defend my crew, and each time I could do nothing. I do not know how we escaped the atronachs. I could not tell you where we sailed nor how. It was luck alone. Tu'whacca blessed their passing and cursed ours for our journey is not yet over.\n\nThe distance between our ship and the safety of Summerset feels insurmountable. Our journey is doomed by the sea and the sky. Enemies spring from the waters we must travel and even now my beloved crew succumbs to the pain of the past few days. \n\nI know not how these accounts of our sorry may be remembered, but I know they will survive us. If, by some blessing from the gods, we survive. I will renounce the waters I once loved. They have turned against me. May Tava see us home or end us quickly.

{{21337012-0-1133:}}By Sinjin\n\nIf King Rislav had no battle experience beforehand, that was shortly to change. Word spread quickly to the Imperial City that Skingrad, once offered, was now being taken back. Gorieus was an accomplished warrior even before taking the throne, and the seventeen years he had as Emperor were scarcely peaceful. Only eight months before Dorald's assassination and Rislav's ascendancy, Gorieus and the Alessian army had faced another of his coronation guests, Kjoric the White, on the fields of the frozen north. The High Chieftain of Skyrim lost his life in the Battle of Sungard. While the pact of chieftains was selecting a new leader, Cyrodiil was busily grabbing back the land of southern Skyrim that it had lost.\n\nIn short, Emperor Gorieus knew how to deal with rebellious vassals.\n \nThe Alessian army poured westward "like a flood of death," to borrow the chronicler's phrase, in numbers far exceeding what would be required to conquer Skingrad. Gorieus could not have thought actual battle was likely. Rislav, as we said, had little to no experience at warfare, and only a few days' practice at kingcraft. His kingdom and all of the Colovian West had just been ravaged by plague. The Alessians anticipated a mere show of arms, and a surrender.\n\nRislav instead prepared for battle. He quickly inspected his troops and drew up plans.\n \nThe chroniclers who had heretofore ignored the life of Rislav now devote verse after verse describing the king's aspect with fetishistic delight. While it may lack literary merit and taste, we are at least given some details at last. Not surprisingly, the king wore the finest armor of his era, as the Colovian Estates then had the finest leathersmiths—the only type of armor available—in all of Tamriel. The king's klibanion mail, boiled and waxed for hardness, and studded with inch-long spikes, was a rich chestnut red, and he wore it over his black tunic but under his black cloak. The statue of Rislav the Righteous which now stands in Skingrad is a romanticized version of the king, but not inaccurate except in the armor represented. No bard of the Colovian West would have gone to the market so lightly protected. But it does, as we will see, include the most important accoutrements of Rislav: his trained hawk and his fast horse.\n\nThe winter rains had washed through the roads to the south, sending much of West Weald spilling into Valenwood. The Emperor took the northern route, and King Rislav with a small patrol of guards met him at a low pass on what is now the Gold Road. The Emperor's army, it is said, was so large that the Beast of Anequina could hear its march from hundreds of miles away, and despite himself, the chroniclers say, he quaked in fear.\n\nRislav, it was said, did not quake. With perfect politeness, he told the Emperor that his party was too large to be accommodated in the tiny kingdom of Skingrad.\n \n"Next time," Rislav said. "Write before you come."\n\nThe Emperor was, like most Alessian Emperors, not a man of great humor, and he thought Rislav touched by Sheogorath. He ordered his personal guards to arrest the poor madman, but at that moment, the King of Skingrad raised his arm and sent his hawk flying into the sky. It was a signal his army had been waiting for. The Alessians were all within the pass and the range of their arrows.\n\nKing Rislav and his guard began riding westward as fast as if they had been "kissed by wild Kynareth," as the chroniclers said. He did not dare to look behind him, but his plan went faultlessly. The far eastern end of the pass was sealed by rolling boulders, giving the Alessian no direction to go but westward. The Skingrad archers rained arrows down upon the Imperial army from far above on the plateaus, remaining safe from reprisal. The furious Emperor Gorieus chased Rislav from the Weald to the Highlands, leaving Skingrad far behind, all the while his army growing steadily smaller and smaller.\n \nIn the ancient Highland forest, the Imperial army met the army of Rislav's father-in-law, the King of Kvatch. The Alessian army likely still outnumbered their opponents, but they were exhausted and their morale had been obliterated by the chase amid a sea of arrows. After an hour's battle, they retreated north into what is now the Imperial Reserve, and from there, further north and east, to slip back to nurse their wounds and pride in Nibenay.\n\nIt was the beginning of the end of the Alessian hegemony. The Kings of the Colovian West joined with Kvatch and Skingrad to resist Imperial incursions. The clan Direnni under Ryain was inspired to outlaw the religion of the Alessian Reform throughout his lands in High Rock, and began pushing into Imperial territories. The new High Chief of Skyrim, Hoag, now called Hoag Merkiller, though sharing the Emperor's official xenophobia, also joined the resistance. His heir, King Ysmir Wulfharth of Atmora, helped continue the struggle upon Hoag's death in battle, and also insured his place in history.\n\nThe heroic King of Skingrad, who faced the Emperor's army virtually alone, and triggered its end, justly deserves his sobriquet of Rislav the Righteous.

{{21337012-0-4251:}}Before the Ages of Man: The Merethic Era\n\nby Aicantar of Shimmerene\n\nThe Merethic Era was figured by early Nord scholars as a series of years numbered in reverse order backward from their "beginning of time": the founding of the Camoran Dynasty, recorded as Year Zero of the First Era. The prehistoric events of the Merethic Era are listed here with their traditional Nord Merethic dates. The earliest Merethic date cited by King Harald's scholars was ME 2500, the Nord reckoning of the first year of time. As such, the Merethic Era extends from ME 2500 in the distant past to ME 1, the year before the founding of the Camoran Dynasty and the establishment of the White-Gold Tower as an independent city-state.\n\nAccording to King Harald's bards, ME 2500 was the date of construction of the Adamantine Tower on Balfiera Island in High Rock, the oldest known structure of Tamriel. (This corresponds roughly to the earliest historical dates given in various unpublished Elven chronicles.)\n\nDuring the early Merethic Era, the aboriginal beast-peoples of Tamriel (the ancestors of the Khajiit, Argonians, Orcs, and other beastfolk) lived in preliterate communities throughout Tamriel.\n\nIn the Middle Merethic Era, the Aldmeri refugees (mortals of Elven origin) left their doomed, now-lost continent of Aldmeris (also known as "Old Ehlnofey") and settled in southwestern Tamriel. The first colonies were distributed at wide intervals on islands along the entire coast of Tamriel. Later inland settlements were founded primarily in fertile lowlands in southwest and central Tamriel. Wherever the beastfolk encountered the Elves, the sophisticated, literate, technologically advanced Aldmeri cultures displaced the primitive beastfolk into the jungles, marshes, mountains, and wastelands. The Adamantine Tower was rediscovered and captured by the Direnni, a prominent and powerful Aldmeri clan. They built Crystal Tower on Summerset Isle and, later, the White-Gold Tower in Cyrodiil.\n\nDuring the Middle Merethic Era, Aldmeri explorers mapped the coasts of Vvardenfell, building the First Era High Elven wizard towers at Ald Redaynia, Bal Fell, Tel Aruhn, and Tel Mora in Morrowind. It was also during this period that Ayleid (Wild Elven) settlements flourished in the heartland surrounding White-Gold Tower (in present-day Cyrodiil). Wild Elves, also known as the Heartland High Elves, preserved the Dawn Era magics and language of the Ehlnofey. Ostensibly a tributary to the High King of Alinor, the Heartland's long lines of communication from the Summerset Isles' sovereignty effectively isolated Cyrodiil from the High Kings at Crystal Tower.\n\nThe Late Middle Merethic Era is the period of the High Velothi Culture. The Chimer, ancestors of the modern Dunmer, or Dark Elves, were dynamic, ambitious, long-lived Elven clans devoted to fundamentalist ancestor worship. The Chimer clans followed the Prophet Veloth out of the ancestral Elven homelands in the southwest to settle in the lands now known as Morrowind. Despising the secular culture and profane practices of the Dwemer, the Chimer also coveted the lands and resources of the Dwemer, and for centuries provoked them with minor raids and territorial disputes. The Dwemer (Dwarves), free-thinking, reclusive Elven clans devoted to the secrets of science, engineering, and alchemy, established underground cities and communities in the mountain range (later the Velothi Mountains) separating modern Skyrim and Morrowind.\n\nThe Late Merethic Era marks the precipitous decline of Velothi culture. Some Velothi settled in villages near declining and abandoned ancient Velothi towers. During this period, Velothi high culture disappeared on Vvardenfell Island. The earliest Dwemer Freehold colonies date from this period. Degenerate Velothi devolved into tribal cultures which, in time, either evolved into the modern Great Houses of Morrowind or persisted as the barbarian Ashlander tribes. The only surviving traces of this tribal culture are scattered Velothi towers and Ashlander nomads on Vvardenfell Island. The original First Era High Elven wizard towers along the coasts of Tamriel were also abandoned around this time.\n\nIn the Late Merethic Era, pre-literate humans, the so-called "Nedic Peoples," migrated from the continent of Atmora (also "Altmora" or "the Elder Wood" in Aldmeris) and settled in northern Tamriel. The Nord culture hero Ysgramor, leader of a great colonizing fleet to Tamriel, is credited with developing a runic transcription of Nord speech based on Elvish principles, and so Ysgramor is considered the first human historian. Ysgramor's fleet landed at Hsaarik Head at the extreme northern tip of Skyrim's Broken Cape. The Nords built the legendary city of Saarthal there. The Elves drove the Men away during the Night of Tears, but Ysgramor soon returned with his Five Hundred Companions.\n\nAlso during the Late Merethic Era, a legendary immortal hero, warrior, sorcerer, and king (variously known as Pelinal Whitestrake, Harrald Hairy Breeks, Ysmir, and Hans the Fox) wandered Tamriel. He gathered armies, conquered lands, ruled them, and then abandoned his kingdoms so he could wander again.

{{20958740-1-4321:}}I can do that.
{{20958740-0-4320:}}Fire lizards? You mean Daedra?
{{55049764-2-14135:}}I thought Magister Irin would be as mad as a wet Dragon. But he looks amused. It's probably because he's wanted to turn Huldressa into a guar at some point, he just won't admit it. And the fact that we fixed it all before he got here helped.
{{55049764-8-14144:}}The King's Arrow? Is that really you, my friend? Where you fly, victory is sure to follow. But what are you doing here? How did you find me?
{{55049764-4-15803:}}Fate's threads led us to this old shrine for a reason. It is up to us to discern why. Look around, proxy. Something here is important enough to attract Torvesard's attention.
{{55049764-7-15803:}}It is a vexing conundrum. I am not without a certain amount of sympathy for Torvesard and his cause. Yet I have learned that Hermaeus Mora does not lie. If he says Torvesard must be stopped, then we must stop him.
{{55049764-1-9156:}}<You notice a prominent handbill on the requisition board.>\n\n"The people of West Weald bid you welcome! Masters of the craft await you in <<1>>! New crafters shall be trained! Accomplished crafters will be certified! All at no cost to you!"
{{55049764-3-15794:}}A strange vision! They were worried about the Ayleids, but there haven't been Ayleids here in centuries upon centuries.\n\nSpeaking of strange, it looks like we've gained a new companion. I assume you know that High Elf?
{{55049764-4-4587:}}Thank you for finding those shards. Now the Supernal Dreamers will have no way to open their Daedric gates. However, as long as thier leader is alive they won't stop.
{{55049764-2-13695:}}The Stonewastes' my tribe's home for an eternity. To see it ruined like this, and so viciously … just unbearable.
{{55049764-5-14641:}}With the harrowstorm cleared, my hunt nears an end. I've scryed the location of the Pale Worm, the vampire lord you glimpsed at the ritual site.\n\nAs you've no doubt surmised, tracking the Worm is what brought me to Skyrim.
{{55049764-1-15736:}}What? I was resting! Besides, you got along fine without me. I'm awake and materialized now because I never could resist a good celebration—that includes not a single other Telvanni who is out to get me.
{{55049764-6-15803:}}The fraying of these threads has only just begun. Torvesard was here, and quite recently. Follow this trail with care—he may still be close by, or have allies here. I shall join you momentarily.
{{55049764-2-15787:}}Use the relic. Let us see what it reveals.
{{55049764-2-15803:}}That memory showed us priests of Mephala, persecuted by servants of the Tribunal. But I do not know anything about a skein, or why such a thing might be of interest to Torvesard.\n\nActivate the gate. If there are answers, they are through there.
{{55049764-0-15736:}}Well, this is a fine brouhaha, isn't it?
{{55049764-6-7615:}}I see you've reacquainted yourself with <<1>>. Unacquainted? Unrequited!\n\nThere, there … she'll come around to you. Like I did!
{{55049764-0-15803:}}Stay your blade. Whatever Torvesard was hoping to find here appears to be gone. But he might be willing to explain his purpose if you simply give him the opportunity.
{{55049764-5-15803:}}A Daedric shrine, overrun by Goblins? Sometimes the threads of fate lead me into the most unpleasant sorts of places. Follow the trail, please. I have no wish to linger here.
{{55049764-3-15803:}}This nebulous manifestation appears to be a condensation of—ah. Never mind. The wisp is an ancient memory. The presence of the Echonir renders it accessible to us. Please examine it, proxy.
{{55049764-6-14641:}}Locate a harrowstorm, and begin your assault. I will join the fray. Flank them while they're distracted.\n\nGood hunting. Partner.
{{55049764-1-15803:}}Good. The portal still exists, even after all this time. Lead the way, proxy.
{{55049764-3-2713:}}Finally my father stops chasing the mirage! I advised him to listen to Ash'abah weeks ago. Better late than never. If you will go speak with Marimah, I will reach out to my Ash'abah contacts as well. \n\nWe will find a way to stop the Withered Hand.
{{55049764-1-8969:}}<You notice a prominent handbill on the requisition board.>\n\n"The people of West Weald bid you welcome! Masters of the craft await you in <<1>>! New crafters shall be trained! Accomplished crafters will be certified! All at no cost to you!"
{{55049764-0-6448:}}Ezreba is grateful for your kindness.
{{55049764-12-12452:}}So, you mean to aid us with this Draugrkin business? Thank goodness. Shelaria seems like a competent warrior, but her injuries are pretty severe.
