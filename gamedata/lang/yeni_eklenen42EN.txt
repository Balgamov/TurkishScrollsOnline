{{232026500-0-16458:}}This turned out to be quite the patrol.
{{232026500-0-16948:}}And Torvesard. But did you see how Ithelia transformed when she absorbed the power from the Loom?
{{232026500-0-16421:}}Good luck with the wedding, Laeni.
{{232026500-0-16423:}}Lady Weatherleah and her son can rest easy thanks to you.

{{232026500-0-16522:}}I defeated Oakenclaw and put up the warning bulletins.
{{232026500-0-16416:}}And Torvesard. But did you see how Ithelia transformed when she absorbed the power from the Loom?
{{232026500-0-16489:}}I gathered the venom crystals from the crystaljacks.

{{232026500-0-16417:}}Gadayn would want us to finish this.

{{232026500-0-16412:}}So what do those connections tell us, Leramil.

{{232026500-0-16679:}}What happens now, Constable Yabren?
{{232026500-0-16419:}}You really don't remember Ithelia, Leramil?
{{232026500-0-16418:}}Is it over then? Our reality is safe now?
{{232026500-0-16414:}}So what now Beragon?
{{232026500-0-16808:}}See What <<1>> Wants
{{232026500-0-16488:}}I'm interested in work. Where do I start?
{{232026500-0-16877:}}Ulrath and all your legionaries were dead. I found this report he wrote before he died.
{{232026500-0-16944:}}It was quite the journey, Nahlia.
{{232026500-0-16433:}}Yes, I used the alarum to retrieve the Aetherial shards you asked for.
{{232026500-0-16431:}}Your friend Tham needs you, Maerenah.
{{232026500-0-16438:}}There are plenty of wolves in the den, Grander.
{{232026500-0-16864:}}I found this Ghost Light Bottle on Xoryn.
{{232026500-0-16866:}}She said you would know what happened here.
{{232026500-0-16913:}}Ulrath was the only legionary to survive. He gave me this report and said he was leaving.
{{232026500-0-16859:}}I found Trapper Marcien. They were tangled in their own net.
{{232026500-0-16857:}}I've got an old guzzard and a note from a trapper to deliver it to you.
{{232026500-0-16856:}}I've got an adolescent guzzard and a note from a trapper to deliver it to you.
{{232026500-0-16852:}}How did you hope things would go?
{{232026500-0-16817:}}Another wing of the Scholarium taken care of.
{{232026500-0-16516:}}I killed Fang and Talon and destroyed the Goblins' training supplies.
{{232026500-0-16929:}}The others helped restore you. Without her, you won't be whole.
{{232026500-0-16858:}}I've got Versidue and a note from a trapper to return it to you.
{{232026500-0-16427:}}Here you go. The Emblem of the Last King, as requested.
{{232026500-0-16774:}}How long before the Legion reinforcements arrive?
{{232026500-0-16937:}}Is the threat here over?
{{232026500-0-16440:}}Yes, I completed the legionary's mission. The signal fires are blazing.
{{232026500-0-16441:}}What happened?
{{232026500-0-16507:}}I gathered the items you wanted from Fyrelight Cave.
{{232026500-0-16863:}}I found this Ghost Light Bottle.
{{232026500-0-16430:}}Here, take Abolisher. What's next for you, tribune?
{{232026500-0-16865:}}I found this piece of Living Glass with Xoryn's things.
{{232026500-0-16436:}}Haldain's dead. I found these near his body. He wanted you to have them.
{{232026500-0-16437:}}Here are the ritual items.
{{232026500-0-16435:}}Here's the wine I recovered.
{{232026500-0-16434:}}In time you'll be able to rebuild.
{{232026500-0-16439:}}How long until the Legion reinforcements arrive?
{{232026500-0-16972:}}Here's the wildburn seed I took from the ruins.
{{232026500-0-16973:}}Take Abolisher. What's next for you, tribune?
{{232026500-0-16763:}}I'm committed, Nahlia. Let's get to it.
{{200879108-0-81178:}}My dear aunt suffered a terrible fall in her library. It's tragic, she certainly had many more years ahead of her. Now those she left behind are trying to piece together her final wishes. Even her son deigned to return.
{{200879108-0-80913:}}I feel … sad. Oh, it aches! What's this pressure in my chest? I can't stand it!
{{200879108-0-80912:}}That's true. I've felt incomplete this whole time. I need her strength to help me shoulder the burden of my sorrows.\n\nThank you for your kindness, stranger. I'm ready to go home.
{{200879108-0-81639:}}Not as much as I would like. They're one of the possible threats on my list to investigate. Some sort of order or cult made up mostly of Wood Elves. And now I know that they're apparently working with and taking orders from Daedra!
{{200879108-0-80916:}}I … I understand, proxy. Please, leave me for a moment. Talk to Scruut. I … I must process this news.
{{200879108-0-81013:}}When word arrived of Hermaeus Mora's plan for me, I crumbled. My followers are loyal, but they couldn't face down the combined might of the other Princes. What resistance we presented was quickly crushed. \n\nAnother testament to my weakness.
{{200879108-0-80914:}}Please, return another facet. There's one nearby. It feels boisterous. My delight, maybe? I need more than despair, it's overwhelming.\n\nI always liked celebrating at Stonechip Tavern in Ontus. Check there. Now, I need to lie down for a bit.
{{200879108-0-79319:}}You stopped Shardmarshal Vargas at Rustwall Estate and Feldagard Keep. And at Ostumir, we discovered the Recollection created the new forest and the Wildburn. That led us to Hoperoot, where we unmasked King Nantharion as their leader.
{{200879108-0-80819:}}Whatever your answer was, it was just one of many that might solve that simple question. I, in turn, might have said gratitude or affection.\n\nIt's important that you learn from my mistakes before attempting to craft your riddle.
{{200879108-0-78593:}}Master Bogvir? Is that the name he uses now? You know, he bears a striking resemblance to an old acquaintance of mine. In fact, I'm sure of it.\n\nHow is Fennorian and why has he come to Valente Vineyard?
{{200879108-0-81438:}}We were, but I was married. He urged me to leave the Scarlets after we split the vineyard prize. Go back to my family. But I loved the thrill of it all.\n\nPrison changed that. By the time I got out, I wanted nothing to do with the Scarlets.
{{200879108-0-78598:}}Whether this note was sent by the killer or a kind soul close to Lady Weatherleah, it confirms one thing. That there is indeed a traitor among us. And with this letter, Mizzik can do what he does best.\n\nPlay cat and mouse.
{{200879108-0-81298:}}You're damned right I'll see this through to the end with you. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nHeh. I can't wait to see what the Votary Commander and Guildmaster Galerion make of all this!
{{200879108-0-81296:}}Back in the refuge, Val mentioned that she was trying to mend the broken roots with her family and start anew. I need to tell them what happened. How much she loved them.\n\nAnd I need to do the same for the other Scarlets who didn't make it.
{{200879108-0-81295:}}First, we tend to Val and get her home to her family. I was even thinking of staying in Marbruk with her.\n\nBut in time I'd like to return here. Bury whatever remains of Caelum I can find next to his family. I owe him that much.
{{200879108-0-81294:}}We agreed to sit down and talk through our regrets if we all made it. But after that, I think we each have our next chapters planned. This time with direction.\n\nVal insisted I join her in Marbruk. I think I will.
{{200879108-0-78599:}}Oh, don't trouble yourself. Any guest of Bogvir's is welcome! Enjoy yourself, and do make sure to try the wine.
{{200879108-0-81431:}}Absolutely. We're relying on him to help us understand what's useful, what's valuable, and what's just scrap paper. He told me the altar is already vibrating along his transmutational axis. \n\nI have no idea what that means, but I think it's good.
{{200879108-0-82018:}}Among other things, Mora taught me to perceive the threads of fate. It is a talent few mortals ever master. As for the rest … let us say I have seen things most mages and arcanists can barely imagine.\n\nThat is why I am sometimes called the Wise.
{{200879108-0-82019:}}Very good. I do not know what awaits you at Rustwall, but look for our ally Beragon at Ostumir. He mentioned he had business of his own there. \n\nAs for Elenglynn, I will meet you there. I am quite curious to see those ruins.
{{200879108-0-81434:}}Mirrormoor. What a desolate place. Do the Shardborn come from there? Maybe Beragon or Leramil can tell us more. We should also have them examine the blade. What did Vargas call it? Abolisher. Huh.\n\nWould it be all right if I took the sword to them?
{{200879108-0-81578:}}It's in the ruins, down in the deepest part of the catacombs. Two magical anchor things keep it open.\n\nTribune Alea is strong, and you look like you can handle yourself. While the Recollection hunts me, you need to destroy that portal!
{{200879108-0-81601:}}I'm not sure. It's just an idea. Maybe a nudge from the Singer himself. The Wilderhall holds the ancient knowledge of our clan. \n\nPerhaps there's something in there that will set Laeni and Clendagal free, like a flock of pollen bats in the night.
{{200879108-0-81605:}}You've seen the state she's in. She doesn't even realize the effect she's having on existence. She's just so full of rage and anger. If we don't act—and by we, I mean you—by the time she realizes what she's doing, it will be too late to stop it.
{{200879108-0-80052:}}A scroll nearby details a series of challenges. Expressions of power both subtle, and not.\n\nChoose two to complete, that I might know what power means to you.
{{200879108-0-80054:}}You do not know me, yet, but I am no taskmaster. Power expressed against ones will is no power at all. Attempt only the challenges that appeal to you.\n\nWhen you are done, return. And we will take your next step together.
{{200879108-0-80959:}}He might be. There were several others with him when he attacked our camp. They could already be in the sunken ruins. We should be careful.
{{200879108-0-80956:}}Lost Prospect. Yes. I believe the land he speaks of is just east of Riften.\n\nFoxroot is exceedingly rare. An herb used in clever magic. Ulfsild often sent the Fox on errands to retrieve it. Its scent must remind the Gryphon of her.
{{200879108-0-79690:}}The price of sapience is resisting things out of our control. That's indeed a sad thing.\n\nI'm not overly fond of Daedra. Their inflexible nature make them useful only as personifications of abstract concepts. But thank you for this new perspective.
{{200879108-0-81237:}}The ritual to create a Luminary took an enormous toll. It took years to recover, and Shalidor was long gone by that point. It was a dark time. But it wasn't the end of my story. \n\nDark chapters are just that, moments in time. Downturns in the tale.
{{200879108-0-78658:}}I'm sorry. Did you say Lady Valente's name is Ursilia? Oh. She's that Ursilia. \n\nShould we leave? Maybe we can sneak out the way we came in.
{{200879108-0-78653:}}Like I said, we don't use it very often. And the bears have to live somewhere, right?\n\nUm, you should also know … I'm not much of a warrior. Never had much use for fighting back in Ontus, and we haven't gotten very far with my training.
{{200879108-0-78967:}}Vargas? I know not that name. Since the memories of Ithelia returned, I recognize that her fallen realm is Mirrormoor and its Dremora belong to the Shardborn clan, but little else.\n\nAn invasion from Rustwall would have devastated Skingrad. Well done.
{{200879108-0-79693:}}Well, thank you for putting up with our musings. We should probably be off. Skingrad awaits us!
{{200879108-0-78414:}}Once this trouble started, the Mages Guild placed the rune-covered spheres to alert us to Daedric incursions. That's how we knew to send the scouts that noticed Hessedaz in the first place.\n\nOnly problem, the runes need to be regularly recharged.
{{200879108-0-79670:}}Such is the nature of metaphysical debate. Perhaps the Daedra delight in confusing us, and we empower them when we think of them. I wonder, when we sleep at night, do they weaken, since we don't consider them?
{{200879108-0-79671:}}I don't doubt it! We all must confront our inner Molag Bal at some point. That's the struggle of sapience—we cannot control what we desire. As a fellow philosopher, I applaud you.
{{200879108-0-78412:}}Complete and utter nuisances, but usually not too much of a problem. But training tharrikers? This we simply cannot abide. I can't even imagine where to begin my report on this! \n\nSave me the headache and deal with this training camp.
{{200879108-0-80096:}}You just continue to impress, again and again. With a Luminary's strength added to the altar, who knows what you'll be able to accomplish?\n\nAs you might imagine, guild leadership is very interested in the art of Scribing.
{{200879108-0-79500:}}Run away? I see. It's strange. I find myself so hurt by someone I never met. Who am I to begrudge someone for wanting greener pastures? I hope she finds what she's looking for. \n\nI'll be fine. Mother taught us Nemarcet men to persevere.
{{200879108-0-79502:}}I can't, stranger, I'm sorry. I teach the children if they want to leave, they should. It would be wrong to say different to Laeni.\n\nI'll go find Ciiril. Perhaps I can see the couple before they leave town.
{{200879108-0-81691:}}It's the strangest thing. I'm certain it's somewhere in a Daedric realm, but it's … shrouded, somehow. Protected.\n\nAnd it wasn't always there. It's like a bubble of our world suspended by a thread in that realm. The thread being this portal.
{{200879108-0-80997:}}She always said Wood Elves should rightfully own Ayleid lands. It was just an academic argument. I think the Recollection plans to make it real. Might explain why they want the wildburn seed.\n\nOh, right. Did you get it?
{{200879108-0-78293:}}I'm saying that before I returned to get you and Leramil, I examined a number of these instabilities. Some in the Telvanni Peninsula. Even a few in Apocrypha. If they all grow into these reality tears … well, we're all doomed is an understatement!
{{200879108-0-80771:}}With her portals, you and the knight can flow with the wind. We'll need that, to help this man. Ask her to come speak to me. \n\nI will make her float with knowledge, and you can prepare for your journey.
{{200879108-0-80770:}}In Valenwood, the oldest trees are revered. But the long shadows they cast can strangle saplings before they take root. \n\nMinth and Nedolir are much the same. They're giants. But we need new growth to secure the future.
{{200879108-0-80777:}}He expected me to follow in his footsteps. I tried. But it's one thing to hold a sword and another thing to use it. I have the heart of a historian. I'm not made for battle.\n\nThe last words between us were so bitter. I wanted to make amends.
{{200879108-0-80775:}}What remained? Speak plainly, mercenary. What's the condition of my squadron? And what about the treacherous Orc, Ulrath?
{{200879108-0-80890:}}Keshargo has theories, but he cannot confirm them.\n\nXoryn's attire is reminiscent of the structures and decorations of the citadel. Perhaps he sees himself as a kindred of the Daedra who lived here? Or he just wants the power of the knot for himself.
{{200879108-0-78780:}}That's not far from Hoperoot, our new settlement. Count Calantius has refused our offers of cooperation, so I cannot assist you directly. But if you learn anything more that you feel I should know, find me at Hoperoot.
{{200879108-0-78257:}}Blue Aedral is the pride of my family's winery. It's aged for ten years in barrels made from the planks of Skingrad's first longhouse. This particular batch finally reached maturity and we were taking it to market when we were set upon.
{{200879108-0-78255:}}Too much jostling ruins Blue Aedral, so we had to travel exceptionally slowly to reach the market. Legion's Rest has always been a safe place to stop. Ruri, my caravan leader, picked the location and our secret route personally.
{{200879108-0-80734:}}Let's open the door to my domain and let some of my beauty, my majesty, into the Scholarium.\n\nPlace the fable on the dais. Yes, the original fable. Not the new and enhanced version I wrote. That one won't work, unfortunately.
{{200879108-0-78256:}}Lazen is a great many things. My head of security, my chief inspector, my groundskeeper. Each role pivotal to the continued success of my vineyard and all the more reason we find him as quickly as possible.\n\nAlso, he's my dear pet dog.
{{200879108-0-81543:}}I am. \n\nLike I said, the misunderstanding here was fueled by fear. But there's nothing to be afraid of anymore. There are other places in Tamriel where Goblins and humans coexist, it's not impossible.
{{200879108-0-79096:}}Most often it is because of frivolous spending, but records indicate that Lady Weatherleah was frugal with her wealth. She retained only a small staff and requested only minimal upkeep of the estate grounds.\n\nAnd yet, her safe is empty.
{{200879108-0-79093:}}And he was the only one who could have ended the imposter's ruse. But then there is Edric's confession. Could it be a forgery to throw us off the trail, or a convenient end to our investigation? I sense another hasty painting is before us.
{{200879108-0-81391:}}He's been my family's trusted caravan leader for ages, since before I was even old enough to work in the vineyard. I never took him for the scheming sort, but from that letter, it seems he wanted far more than what we were paying him.
{{200879108-0-81397:}}I turned my alchemy stove into the finest experimental drink maker in Tamriel. You can be the first to try it!\n\nFor each ingredient, we'll need to get the temperature just right. I'll call out for more or less heat, you turn the appropriate valve.
{{200879108-0-81394:}}You mean after we reach market and sell the Blue Aedral? Then it's back to the winery to start all over again. Oh, I'll probably have a bit of a rest first. Maybe keep a bottle of the good stuff for myself this time.\n\nThe taste really is exquisite!
{{200879108-0-81395:}}What? You do? Well, that makes things easier. I'm not sure where you got ingredients that no longer exist, but a good innkeeper knows when not to ask questions.\n\nCan you help me make the drink? I'll read from the recipe book while you do the rest!
{{200879108-0-81398:}}The Outcast Inn? Of course. Now that we know what happened there and at Feldagard Keep, I have what I need to decipher this map.\n\nSo not only did we stop Nantharion from unleashing more wildburn. We have a clue to his next move. And that's not all.
{{200879108-0-81399:}}The Outcast Inn? I know the place. It helps explain some of the markings on this encoded map.\n\nSo not only did we stop Nantharion from sending a wildburn seed to Skingrad. We found a lead to Ithelia's whereabouts. And that's not all.
{{200879108-0-80119:}}Of course. But don't mistake him for a mere scrivener. He is a man with a penchant for ruins, a fondness for levers, and an appetite for adventure that would rival a senche's hunger.
{{200879108-0-80113:}}All necromancy is sacrilege to Arkay, but this particular ritual could endanger all of West Weald. The necromancers were attempting to resurrect an undead army. I shudder to think what they may have intended to use it for.
{{200879108-0-80112:}}We need to gather the items used for the spell and remove them from the ruins. We should also burn any corrupted corpses we find and destroy the undead lurking here. Their souls cannot move on until their bodies are laid to rest.
{{200879108-0-80111:}}The ancient Elves that ruled before the Empire built keeps, crypts, and fortifications throughout the land. This was one of the last of them before their kingdoms fell. Now all are in ruins, overrun by monsters and rogues.
{{200879108-0-80110:}}You're unfamiliar with the great Narsis Dren? Surely you've encountered his works at some point. "Narsis Dren and the Draugr Dilemma"? "Narsis Dren and the Well of Gold"?
{{200879108-0-80114:}}Arkay help me, I have worked with worse. Your necromantic insight could prove useful here—reprehensible as it is. But if I should perish, leave my body out of your unseemly practice. I would rather stay dead.
{{200879108-0-79777:}}It will not be easy to overcome the distrust the Recollection sowed between Colovians and Wood Elves. But thanks to your valiant defense of West Weald, I think I can convince my people to see the opportunities here, not just the threats.
{{200879108-0-79762:}}You inspired me, friend. Put the adventuring bug back in my bonnet. I'll help deal with any remaining Daedra and Recollection forces in West Weald. Assist with the Vashabar negotiations.\n\nAfter that, I'm sure I can find something else exciting.
{{200879108-0-79765:}}Daedric …? Oh, of—of course I remember. Torvesard and Vargas. The rogue Dremora working with the Recollection. But we took care of them, comrade. We're celebrating our victory. Those vile creatures should be the last thing on our minds.
{{200879108-0-79648:}}Eventually. After I make sure any remnants of Lord Gallio's vile experiments are taken care of here. Then I may check on the auction guests that scattered and see that any absconded bottles of Vesper Valente are dealt with.\n\nThere's always something.
{{200879108-0-79318:}}Strange events drew Leramil the Wise to West Weald. Daedric incursions. A great new forest, ringed by a devastated region called the Wildburn. And the appearance of an Ayleid cult known as the Recollection.\n\nLeramil asked you to help her investigate.
{{200879108-0-79315:}}Ah, yes, that's the question, isn't it? As an altar, would they use sacred water? Or would they use blood, since they venerated the Daedra? Or would they simply use wine?
{{200879108-0-79314:}}The altar controls passage by way of that gate, but will open only to a particular libation. Typical Ayleid thinking. One of the bottles we've acquired from the Recollection will do the trick. Choose carefully, assistant. I have faith in you.
{{200879108-0-79317:}}A relic woven by Mephala, Daedric Prince of Secrets. It tracks Ithelia and the Unseen, but I do not know exactly how. It was locked in a vault long ago and forgotten.\n\nGiven the Recollection's interest in Niryastare, I think it might be there.
{{200879108-0-81349:}}Great! Yes. Tell me. I've got work in the morning. Don't want to be late.
{{200879108-0-81341:}}I was making my way to Skingrad from Anvil. The Gold Road was stunning until … bam! I'm in this dense jungle.\n\nThen I spotted a pig surrounded by giant bugs. I rescued her. Not long after—ah! A badger caught in vines.
{{200879108-0-81342:}}I agree. But the Daggerfall nobles never appreciated my talents, and the bright lights of Skingrad beckon.\n\nSowerra and Mr. Klauser appreciate me. And I hope the fabulous people of West Weald will as well!
{{200879108-0-81347:}}The note said an old friend wanted me to meet them in the woods to the west. I … don't have any old friends. I threw it away. But if what you say is true, it might be the killer waiting for me!\n\nI need to get Noraine and my son away from here!
{{200879108-0-81026:}}My clothes give it away don't they. I'm a newer member of the scribes. This was going to be my first big expedition, but you can see how well I did. \n\nMaybe next time I'll just stay in Scrivener's Hall.
{{200879108-0-78392:}}Indeed. Though the vampire I acquired this invitation from wasn't the sort to rely on blood servants. He was extremely cruel, preferred the thrill of the hunt, and drank to kill.\n\nThis event becomes stranger the more I try to make sense of it.
{{200879108-0-78393:}}It's not for everyone. The evils this one has seen would turn an alit's stomach. But Mizzik will not settle on his haunches and let criminals get away with their vile deeds. And he has no doubt there is a crime here. He just has to find it.
{{200879108-0-78390:}}Let's see. It promises an evening in the beautiful Colovian countryside … majestic views … new and innovative cultivation … a new vintage called Vesper Valente … the auction …. Ah. Yes. And this.\n\n"Who says wine doesn't belong in a flask?
{{200879108-0-78391:}}I could be reading into things, but in some vampire circles, flask is used as a crude term to refer to a blood servant.\n\nSomeone who willingly lets vampires feed on them, usually for compensation.
{{200879108-0-78396:}}Mizzik knew he would see you again, friend. Perhaps you share his keen nose for the scent of corruption? A good crime-fighting ally is hard to come by. And he has no doubt there is a crime here. He just has to find it.
{{200879108-0-78397:}}He is there in the manor, waiting to claim his inheritance. But it seems strange, yes? Mizzik thinks so. So does <<1>>'s niece. She hired Mizzik to investigate her aunt's death. But to start his investigation, Mizzik must find the will.

{{200879108-0-78395:}}Mizzik was a friend of <<1>>. He worked tirelessly on the case of her missing son when he was just a cub of a crime fighter. It was the one case Mizzik could not solve. Now at the hour of her death, he hears her son has returned.
{{200879108-0-78398:}}Mizzik was a friend of <<1>>. He worked tirelessly on the case of her missing son when he was just a cub of a crime fighter. It was the one case Mizzik could not solve. Now at the hour of her death, he hears her son has returned.
{{200879108-0-78399:}}The tharriker were first spotted shortly after the transformation of the southwestern Weald. The new area of jungle growth the Wood Elves call Dawnwood.\n\nThey appear to be wild and vicious, so take every precaution as you observe them.
{{200879108-0-81748:}}Right. Ulfsild told the Dragon signs to watch out for, so she would know for certain you were Ulfsild's inheritor. Then she left behind instructions for you, or someone like you. \n\nSo you could make sure the Dragon wouldn't know where you stood.
{{200879108-0-81747:}}That worked for the other Luminaries, who would test you on their own terms. But, by her own admission, Ulfsild struggled with the Dragon's trial. \n\nShe wanted to make sure whoever followed in her footsteps didn't have the same problem.
{{200879108-0-81746:}}Keep in mind, this is just what I think happened, all right? Ulfsild knew her days in the Scholarium were limited. So she left behind all these echoes, notes, and fables you've found along the way.
{{200879108-0-81741:}}That's a very mortal viewpoint. Our minds are not so dissimilar. My origin may be more colorful than yours, true. \n\nBut I promise you I am no harder to understand than any other being you've encountered before. Just have a little faith in yourself.
{{200879108-0-80839:}}Just so. We were cataloging tomes and left the fable unattended for just a moment. Then from the other room we heard yips and snarls, and found it torn apart. \n\nNahlia is already at work trying to find an alternative to the missing pages.
{{200879108-0-80834:}}You could say that. As a healer, I assisted in both their births. Laeni took command of the room the moment she drew breath. Clendagal came out fighting.\n\nI was also there when they lost their mothers. For every bright day, there is a dark one.
{{200879108-0-82098:}}Because I had already set the compulsion in Torvesard's mind. I had already unspooled the thread to freedom.\n\nNow your actions have brought me a moment of clarity, but it will not last. Already I feel the power, the madness, reasserting itself.
{{200879108-0-82099:}}A nice thought, but I am Daedra. I cannot change. And once the madness comes upon me, I doubt you will be able to contain me again. Forgotten memories and near-limitless power blinded me. It led us exactly to the moment in time Mora feared.
{{200879108-0-82094:}}The result of the way events played out in those other realities, I suspect. Daedric Princes have no experience with the constant evolution and transformation of mortals. They are eternal and have no point of reference for the transient.
{{200879108-0-82095:}}She was confused, vulnerable. That much I grant you. That, however, is not the same as being mortal.
{{200879108-0-82096:}}Different reflections? You mean the versions of Ithelia that Leramil told me you encountered on the Many Paths? She also said that when you first encountered Ithelia, she looked mortal and was confused and weak, at least by Daedric standards.\n\nHmm.
{{200879108-0-81755:}}Some sort of cult made up mostly of disgruntled Wood Elves. Seems to have a connection to the ancient Ayleids, but I don't have all the details yet.\n\nThat's why I'm out here adventuring again. I want to figure out who they are and what they're up to.
{{200879108-0-79414:}}You can be my first critic! First off, I need to determine what I should be doing. Then we can figure out the assignments for Lady Sowerra, my pig, and Sir Klauser, the badger. \n\nLend me a critical eye and tell me what you think works best.
{{200879108-0-79418:}}Master Lucianos, the mage I'm apprenticed to, uses Aetherial energy for all manner of experiments.\n\nSorry, I'd rather not talk about work. Honestly, I'm more interested in what the necromancers plan to do with them. Before we step in, of course.
{{200879108-0-78973:}}Change does not come naturally to the Daedric Princes. Not like it does for mortals. That is why the One Who Knows sought you out. You are correct about the change, but that was the result of untold power, not a conscious effort.
{{200879108-0-80269:}}Yes. He suggested we hide in here in the first place. He offered to stay with Abel and me while Grivier got the last group out of town, but my husband insisted Tham go with them. \n\nNow they're out there somewhere … with the vampires.
{{200879108-0-80261:}}Which explains why the Goblins were so hostile to the farms. Jerntann doesn't just want the Goblins to be violent, he wants to be paid. \n\nJerntann must have the missing totems!
{{200879108-0-78749:}}Complete our vacation, of course! But no more wandering around on our own. I'm not letting <<1>> out of my sight for the rest of this trip!\n\nThen it's back home.
{{200879108-0-78748:}}Lexi's our dog. Cute little slobberer was a marriage gift, and she's been with us ever since. She's more attached to <<1>> than to me, truth be told, and he's trained her well.\n\nJust blow the whistle and she'll come running.
{{200879108-0-78741:}}Yes. If you can put a stop to their rituals and free anyone still trapped in town, I'll be in your debt. As Baroness of Leftwheal, I promise to make it worth your while.
{{200879108-0-78742:}}Yes, some of the survivors overheard the cultists call themselves the Recollection. I've never dealt with them before, but they're here now. Worst of all, they seem to be summoning in terrible creatures at ritual sites across town.
{{200879108-0-79834:}}I … yes … you're right. You and Maer saved my life. Saved what's left of Sutch. Well, if Maerenah could survive being a vampire, then I can as well. Thank you for helping her.\n\nTell Maer … tell her I'm all right.
{{200879108-0-79830:}}Why would…? Oh, I understand. Azura's Lamp wants to preserve your reality. By helping your Ithelia regain control, she can be safely imprisoned again.\n\nThe ingredient you need is close by. Lute berries. Hurry and take them before it is too late.
{{200879108-0-79832:}}Balandrus was formidable when I ran with him. Now that he calls himself the Terror, I'm not sure what to expect. He'll be with his lieutenants. Maybe a few bloodfiends. And Tham, curse their eyes!\n\nJust remember, if I get turned again, kill me.
{{200879108-0-81291:}}Count Calantius tasked me with continuing to look into the Daedra invading the Weald, try to figure out exactly what they want and how to stop them. I've also been trying to gather intelligence on happenings in the new forest.
{{200879108-0-82111:}}Only partially. Scribing, even in its earliest incarnations, seemed destined to use a Luminary's power. \n\nIt was Ulfsild's idea to bind my domain to the Scholarium. Which in turn led to great achievements and those beautiful doors.
{{200879108-0-82110:}}Indeed. Each of us formed a pocket realm as we were born. None of us could answer the question of why, if that has risen to the top of your mind.\n\nEach of us has an opinion, of course. But that's also in our very nature, it would seem.
{{200879108-0-82113:}}In Ulfsild's time, yes. It did. The strength of the Luminaries, channeled into the very heart of the Scribing Altar, allowed for incredible feats. \n\nAnd may do so again, depending on how you fare.
{{200879108-0-82112:}}I think we are very … alone, each of us. And Aetherius, in its wisdom, did not wish us to be both alone and wandering.\n\nThis sense of isolation is something we each grapple with in our own way. As did Ulfsild, of course. Of course.
{{200879108-0-82115:}}The Many Paths lead everywhere. Other places, other possibilities, parallel realities. You can go anywhere, if you can just find the path.
{{200879108-0-82114:}}The noble beast whose shape I chose felt right at home among these falling petals and verdant greens. \n\nWhen I need a moment's peace, or to rid my mind of stray thoughts, I'm grateful that this was the space that formed around me.
{{200879108-0-82118:}}Oh, totally! They completely expelled every bit of Daedric energy contained within them to restore reality. Now they really are just a lamp, a map, and a sword.
{{200879108-0-80592:}}Oh, I know. But you know Narsis! If there's a button to push or a lever to pull, he can't help himself. That's what makes him such a good treasure hunter.\n\nHe's inspiring, though, isn't he? Aside from all the trouble he usually finds himself in.
{{200879108-0-80109:}}Yes! Vvardenfell, wasn't it? I feel more at ease knowing I can entrust Narsis's well being to a friendly, sympathetic soul.
{{200879108-0-81177:}}Of course, but perhaps not how you expect. I shall work from here to help stitch the threads of fate back together as you place the relics and cast the spell.\n\nHere, take the relics. You will need them for the task ahead.
{{200879108-0-82015:}}I had to really sniff hard for a place I could wriggle through to the Evergloam. Faldar's Tooth is full of cultists … and their prayers did the trick. I hope!\n\nI can sniff, very faintly, some creatia. It smells spooky, like an old mansion!
{{200879108-0-80628:}}The trading post will be operational again in due course. That's one of the reasons I decided to attend this gala. Oh, to honor you, of course. But also to get in a word with the count. We're still waiting for legionaries to safeguard Leftwheal.
{{200879108-0-80067:}}My own. One day, as I enjoyed the sun upon my pelt, I beheld a hunter tracking an indrik and her fawn. The hunter moved in to claim their prize, and the hind perished.\n\nThe fawn leapt for freedom, and the hunter gave chase.
{{200879108-0-80066:}}I needed some willing hands, and they were eager to help. Little did I imagine that they would desire the Emblem more than I.\n\nFeel free to read my notes. Though be warned, they are not on par with the quality of my published works.
{{200879108-0-79261:}}Yes, in the pantry. I kept a tin of medicinal herbs for this very occasion. I could never forgive myself if I had a hand in hurting Betu. Please, hurry, get the herbs!
{{200879108-0-79260:}}Wait, I recognize this smell. Yes, I couldn't place it until now. We use this poison around the estate grounds. We've fallen into such disrepair that beasts have moved into the cellars. Betu knows better than to eat this. He was forced.
{{200879108-0-79265:}}They made a point of shouting so everyone could hear. "Fatigue fever is your fault, you and your crooked father!" I know that's not true. They want to blame her. Said they were taking her to the Ontus reservoir.\n\nNorth … near the river ….
{{200879108-0-80430:}}We decided one big score from one of the finest winemakers in West Weald would see us through. Caelum Vineyard. I scouted the place to make sure no one was around. We snuck in … but the master had come home early.
{{200879108-0-80431:}}Aye. Don't know how—the whole house caught fire. They said in Skingrad it was like seeing dawn at midnight. The guards came quickly. We were waiting, you see. Waiting for the master and his family to make it out.\n\nThey never did.
{{200879108-0-80432:}}It was so fast. Master Caelum came downstairs, his wife behind him with a little lad in her arms. In the commotion, someone knocked over a candelabra. The room was aflame in an instant. It was like a door to Oblivion itself.
{{200879108-0-80433:}}I did a little scouting before you arrived and immediately ran into a squadron of Daedra. Shardborn Dremora, from the looks of it, but other Daedra as well.\n\nNow I want to head to the overlook and get a better view of the current situation.
{{200879108-0-81175:}}The tears occurred unnaturally, so it is unlikely they will heal without help. If the plan provided by Hermaeus Mora works and the fabric of reality is repaired, then I can use the wisdom Ithelia gave me … to try to set one last thing to rights.
{{200879108-0-80965:}}That's a fair question. I don't feel quite like myself, and it's not just the headache I can feel brewing thanks to my delight's indulgence.\n\nI'm still missing two facets. I need you to get them back.
{{200879108-0-80962:}}Keshargo will bring it to Scrivener's Hall, if he can.\n\nThe hall has wards and other defenses active that should keep everyone safe in the event the null arca fails. Perhaps the Scribes of Mora can even figure out a more permanent solution.
{{200879108-0-80609:}}You must know about the forest that sprang into existence seemingly overnight a few months back? And the ring of devastation that surrounds it? The count has legionaries investigating the situation, but no conclusions have been reached as yet.
{{200879108-0-78319:}}<<1>> has been tasked with coordinating efforts to deal with Daedric incursions throughout the Weald. These are dangerous missions that will require an abundance of allies to defeat, but with huge risk comes great reward.
{{200879108-0-78313:}}What aren't we offering at this point? My colleagues, <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>, have a variety of tasks that need to be dealt with.
{{200879108-0-78316:}}<<1>> is a Legion officer who handles missions that can usually be tackled by a single operative. He'd prefer it if the Legion could deal with its own problems, but he understands the need to hire mercenaries in these lean and trying times.
{{200879108-0-80961:}}Yes, this one thinks so. Look at it. The knot is almost shaking with unused energy.\n\nWe need to place the knot in the null arca, before all that energy finds a way to escape.
{{200879108-0-79199:}}I shudder to think what goes through the minds of those savages. I'll leave them to their sticks and mud, thank you very much.
{{200879108-0-79198:}}The Wood Elves have always been somewhat primitive when it comes to their use of magic. Their recent overgrowth has the more civilized people of Skingrad concerned. It's insufferable.
{{200879108-0-81129:}}Speak your vow of charity.
{{200879108-0-81128:}}Your vow has been sworn.
{{200879108-0-81121:}}Exactly. But whether you encountered a premonition or an Ithelia from an alternate reality upon the Many Paths we may never truly know.\n\nNevertheless, I think Ithelia may be on her way to becoming the monster Mora feared—if she isn't there already.
{{200879108-0-81120:}}We defeated Shardmarshal Vargas, destroyed the Loom of the Untraveled Road, and saved this reality. We did deplete the Daedric relics, but such sacrifices must be made sometimes for the greater good.
{{200879108-0-81125:}}Speak your vow of mystery.
{{200879108-0-81127:}}Your vow has been sworn.
{{200879108-0-81126:}}Your vow has been sworn.
{{200879108-0-81187:}}I overheard. And she mentioned the Dragon. Do you think it's another riddle? Magnus, I hope so. \n\nI bet this is an opportunity for you to use Ulfsild's lens to get things started.
{{200879108-0-79439:}}Green preserve me! My brother Nedolir and old Minth are the problem here, sure enough. They've never seen eye to eye. \n\nBut since Vashabar grew, their views have petrified like ancient bark. Neither will bend, but it's the lovelies who suffer.
{{200879108-0-79430:}}All right, let me begin.
{{200879108-0-79431:}}One option is that I dazzle folks with my sword juggling. It's a big crowd-pleaser. But I've noticed it makes the animals nervous.\n\nThe other option is I dance. And dance. And dance! Not as exciting as swords, but the animals enjoy it more.
{{200879108-0-79432:}}What, I'm not allowed to exhibit a little academic curiosity? You sound like Master Lucianos.\n\nThey're risking life and limb to recover these things. What's it all for? Power? Ambition? The spirit of camaraderie? Makes you wonder is all.
{{200879108-0-79436:}}For his part of the performance, he remains in place as I perform around him.\n\nHe can either pretend to be asleep or he can be more active, pretending to eat bugs from a tree. Which do you think is more tantalizing?
{{200879108-0-79437:}}Then it shall be so!
{{200879108-0-81506:}}No. But I can tell you it doesn't lead to a Daedric realm. At least we've got that going for us.\n\nThe other side is shrouded, but it's somewhere on Nirn. Maybe some kind of lingering lost magic from the first era.
{{200879108-0-81180:}}I shouldn't be so flippant with my family's drama. Uriel, my cousin, disappeared years ago. My aunt believed he died in Varen's revolt, yet here he is.\n\nSomething doesn't seem right, but I'll leave the speculation to the investigator.
{{200879108-0-81950:}}It's going well! I'm not usually the type to work at a desk, but it's been interesting to walk the halls and see all the different titles.\n\nFrom what Julian and Irnard have said, this place is a treasure trove of knowledge.
{{200879108-0-81951:}}A section dedicated to cookbooks from the first era. Shelves of poetry from Atmora. And a startling number of bawdy limericks, stacked up in a pile of chapbooks.\n\nArchmage Ulfsild, it seems, was eager to follow the hunt for knowledge wherever it led.
{{200879108-0-81952:}}I suppose you could say that. The bird has been interesting to talk to. I've only spoken with one talking bird before, a rook in the Blackfeather Court. \n\nThe Crow laughed when I mentioned them.
{{200879108-0-81953:}}I asked if she was related to the Blackfeather birds in some way, and the Crow thought that was pretty funny. \n\nI'm going to take that as a no, personally, but I'm not sure what else that tells us.
{{200879108-0-81954:}}Hermaeus Mora rallied other Princes against her. They defeated Ithelia and Mora imprisoned her within the Mythos—the core of Apocrypha. Then he made everyone forget.\n\nTorvesard opened the glyphics and set the imprisoned memories free.
{{200879108-0-81955:}}That's what the Wood Elves who settled here after the forest appeared call their city. It's north of here.\n\nAnyway, she could have come to Ostumir for the Ayleid ruins. There are plenty nearby that might interest her, but that's just a guess.
{{200879108-0-81957:}}From everything the Crow and Ulfsild's texts can tell us, yes. Technically that means we're somewhere in the Shivering Isles right now.\n\nBut don't worry, Ulfsild's safeguards all seem to be holding. Which makes our interloper all the more confusing.
{{200879108-0-80600:}}Oh, I certainly hope so! I must return to Castle Ravenwatch and report on the events at the Valente Vineyards, but before I do, I want to help Ursilia get everything sorted. I owe her that much.\n\nIf you ever need me, send word and I'll be there.
{{200879108-0-78607:}}What—really? Roaming around, doing whatever you want? Answering to no one? Lucky.\n\nMaybe I should see about shifting my focus of study. Master Lucianos isn't going to make anything out of me. If he drops dead maybe I can make something out of him.
{{200879108-0-79055:}}Hmm? You know, it does seem quite reminiscent of that. The tiles are the same, but if I recall correctly, Veloth's solution was on the walls. Perhaps the solution to this one can be found within this epitaph?
{{200879108-0-81188:}}I'm here to help, my friend. Just talk to me if you need a quick way to put out the flames and start again. I've got a spell for that. Here we go.
{{200879108-0-80234:}}Then she still has to make her way back here to safety, and that's not something I can guarantee with all these Goblins around. I know my course. The hunters are the only way to ensure my family's safety.
{{200879108-0-80574:}}I am a healer, a scholar, and a spinner. By aiding the people of Vashabar, I tend to the future. As keeper of the Wilderhall, I tend to the past.
{{200879108-0-81464:}}We didn't have to! Ursilia told me she interrupted the auction and told Lord Gallio in a voice loud enough for all to hear that the Ravenwatch was on the premises. One mention of House Ravenwatch and the invited vampires fled the estate.
{{200879108-0-80573:}}I'm an accomplished blade dancer, and work with Minth as an envoy of the Dawnway.\n\nBefore we left Valenwood, I taught everyone who asked the way of the sword. Wish I'd had a chance to do more.
{{200879108-0-80572:}}Thank you for asking! I'm a part of the Valenwood faithful! An aide to the greenspeakers, advisor to spinners, and tutor for the village children. \n\nWould you like to hear my favorite thing about the Green Pact?
{{200879108-0-81465:}}Of course you do, Not-Ulfsild. How can you be more buoyant? Why do you have no tendrils when I was blessed with so many? Why bother with the other Luminaries when I am right here?\n\nI cannot answer all of life's mysteries for you. But I will try.
{{200879108-0-78699:}}I knew something was off about him, but to think he also played a role in killing my cousin. Lady Weatherleah gave Pelena a comfortable life, looked after her every need. All this death in the pursuit of an absent fortune.
{{200879108-0-78693:}}Pelena will be delivered to Skingrad. With the evidence in hand, she should face charges for the deaths of Uriel, Lady Weatherleah, and our imposter. While it's possible Theophan killed Edric, I am certain she played a role.
{{200879108-0-78690:}}Damn this rotting estate! Everything I did, everyone I killed, I did it for my own survival. I hope it crumbles into dust just like that crone and her son. I spit on their graves!
{{200879108-0-78696:}}Once I've brewed the counteragent, pick up the bucket and splash the remedy over our poor patients.\n\nIt's not the most dignified way to administer medicine, but it works without putting either of you at risk.
{{200879108-0-81622:}}A loom? As in a weaving apparatus? Intriguing. As for Ithelia's home, her realm in Oblivion was forgotten when she was. No records exist that can point us to Mirrormoor.\n\nAnd the thought of restoring what was lost? I do not like the sound of that.
{{200879108-0-78694:}}Fortune aside, what we accomplished today is no small feat. If the fortune was to be found, we'd have stumbled upon it during our investigation.
{{200879108-0-81089:}}They are … someplace else. The Many Paths lead to different possibilities, different realities. There is no way to know where Vargas sent them.\n\nOur best bet is to continue on. Perhaps we shall locate a connection where the Lamp can be used.
{{200879108-0-81084:}}It's all in the communique we recovered. Just ring the bell in the prescribed fashion and that will alert the rest of the Legion that there's a problem at Fort Colovia.\n\nWe can do this, friend! I know we can!
{{200879108-0-81082:}}He had help—a group of necromancers who did most of the work. \n\nXoryn isn't a formidable mage himself. He has some power, but I've seen stronger casters. Still, you can see the damage they did. I'm surprised any of the mortals survived.
{{200879108-0-81083:}}More or less. I marked the approximate locations on your map, but it happened so fast. As aide-de-camp, those items were my responsibility. When the captain sounded the retreat, I hid each of them on the way out.\n\nNow we need to recover them.
{{200879108-0-81080:}}And we'll honor him, as well. All of us! We were up against threats I can barely comprehend, and we came out on top. If that isn't cause for celebration, I don't know what is!\n\nI still find it hard to believe after all that, Ithelia just surrendered.
{{200879108-0-81081:}}Most of the Luminaries have already accepted what this means for the Scholarium. \n\nBut the Gryphon … he's as inflexible as the shield he believes himself to be. If only his little companion could get him to see reason.
{{200879108-0-78950:}}Remind you? Of the greatest innovation of our time? Ah, I see. The intoxicating effects of the wine on the mortals has already rattled your senses.\n\nHave no fear. I hear that we will be allowed to sample the vintage before we make any commitments.
{{200879108-0-78951:}}Haven't you tried it yet? You really must sample the vintage for yourself. \n\nI suggest you find a glass quickly, before the auction begins. All of the servants and attendants must have that wine flowing through their veins for the main event!
{{200879108-0-78954:}}Ithelia said something about a loom and restoring what was lost. And her plan probably leads to the end of reality that Leramil keeps going on about.\n\nLet's take the fight to Ithelia and maybe prevent whatever she has in mind. Are you with me?
{{200879108-0-78957:}}Here. I've marked your map. Take Abolisher to the Telvanni Peninsula, the Lamp to West Weald, and the Skein to Apocrypha. I'll send help to meet you with directions on how to restore the relics.\n\nMeanwhile Leramil and I will try to locate Ithelia.
{{200879108-0-79607:}}While appreciated, this is a test of my own inherent talents. I don't want it to be muddled by outside interference.
{{200879108-0-79606:}}You doubt my abilities? Bear witness, stranger! I'll display the skills that only one of Ayleid heritage could possess!
{{200879108-0-79605:}}You think so? \n\nAh, maybe you're right. My Ayleid ancestors probably wouldn't want me to die foolishly on my first try.
{{200879108-0-79604:}}Oh yes. The ancient Ayleids fled Cyrodiil ages ago. I recently discovered our family tree, and it plainly says one of those Wild Elves was my ancestor. So I'm here, testing out my obvious Ayleid talents in necromancy!
{{200879108-0-79603:}}I'm unleashing the power of my ancestors! I intend to reanimate the dead!\n\nI recently learned I'm descended from ancient Ayleid necromancers. Hah! Can you believe it?
{{200879108-0-79609:}}Talk to some of the townsfolk. They may be more willing to open up to a stranger than to me. You'd be surprised what ordinary folk pick up on when those in power fail to notice.
{{200879108-0-79608:}}Indeed. My father wrote that both the ranch and the quarry were working their laborers very hard of late. But prior to this, I never heard of a fever that strikes down strong, healthy workers in the prime of their lives.\n\nThey call it fatigue fever.
{{200879108-0-81683:}}A templar and priestess of the Eight. A soul on pilgrimage, carrying the light of hope. \n\nI also indulge in the Tales of Tribute game. Julianos has gifted me with skill in card design and play. I have created, in fact, my own Saint Alessia deck.
{{200879108-0-80272:}}Simple. Sacred water goes on an altar. It's quite obvious. Any fool would see that.
{{200879108-0-81554:}}Proxy, you saved reality and discovered a critical relic at the same time. Hermaeus Mora was right to put faith in you.\n\nIf Ithelia has regained her power, we will need that Lamp to find her. Would you mind if I take it to study?
{{200879108-0-81635:}}That's how we met. I love all sorts of history, while she studies Ayleids. The culture and history of those ancient Elves fascinate her.\n\nMy own interests were purely practical. Stuff that could help me back in my adventuring days.
{{200879108-0-80346:}}Nothing, I suppose. Just daydreaming. Valenia and I were close, once.\n\nBah! Enough of that. That was twenty years ago. There are lives in danger today—Valenia's life, too. We should focus on that.
{{200879108-0-80347:}}Fine by me. What else is on your mind?
{{200879108-0-80344:}}Ah, Valenia. There were times I wondered why she chose a thief's life. She had family back in Valenwood. Could have gone home any time. But I was grateful she stayed with us. \n\nShe's in Vashabar now. She … ah, forget it.
{{200879108-0-80345:}}Not much to say about Knives. He was half in the bottle back in our Legion days, and crawled all the way in after we served our time. But I'd rather have him chugging than thieving, I guess.\n\nLast I heard, he was in Ontus.
{{200879108-0-80342:}}Right. I'm not exactly sure how many of us are left. Big Urm, Fallen-Knives and Valenia are the only ones I've been able to track down so far.
{{200879108-0-80343:}}Big Urm? Our chaplain. And a poet, too. She penned the words to our one rule. She could have settled down in a temple, but we needed someone who could bust down doors.\n\nHeard she had some trouble to deal with out at Varen's Watch.
{{200879108-0-78628:}}Well, Pelena keeps going on about Edric, our cook. She says he was acting suspiciously leading up to her death. But, for what it's worth, I find him to be kind. He may be able to shed more light on that situation himself.
{{200879108-0-78629:}}The details don't add up. Investigations always require some stretch of the imagination, but to make sense of this crime scene would be to dream up a work of fantasy.
{{200879108-0-78626:}}No. Lady Weatherleah was the only one in the library. Which is odd, now that I think about it.
{{200879108-0-78627:}}Betu is usually plastered to the Lady's side, but he wasn't in the library. He was shut up in Pelena's room. I wonder why she would have put him there.
{{200879108-0-79978:}}Magic wards left behind by the Indrik. A trio of these wards hide a fragment of his key. \n\nOnce revealed, these wards can be dispelled from a distance. Clear them all and the key fragment will be revealed. Don't worry, I'll help you find it.
{{200879108-0-79976:}}As I said in the library, let the fable be your guide. We are here, at the Lady. The first annotated location in the fable. \n\nJust as you did back at the Scholarium, peer through the True-Sight Lens within a focal point.
{{200879108-0-81629:}}That is one possibility, but another occurs to me now. The true origins of Fargrave are lost. You said Ithelia intended to return home. I wonder if this was her realm before she was forgotten.
{{200879108-0-79027:}}One more piece of the puzzle remains, proxy. You still need to investigate Ostumir. Determine why the threads of fate there are frayed.\n\nWhen you are finished, find me at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad.
{{200879108-0-79025:}}Is he not masterful? Wise, kind, and thoughtful. And so daring! This Emblem that you've returned with is simply fascinating. I'll begin cataloging it while I wait for him to return.
{{200879108-0-79024:}}Step aside, assistant! The great and wise Narsis Dren will now seize the Emblem! I intend to present it to my assistant Elfbetta at her southern camp! Yes, that sounds sufficiently thrilling!
{{200879108-0-79023:}}Given my professional expertise in solving puzzles, I'd venture that the path you take to cross these tiles is related to this nearby epitaph. The tale goes that the five loyal retainers traveled from afar to get here.
{{200879108-0-79022:}}Heh. It seems my former allies are not doing well without me. Petrification traps, locked doors, giant living statues, that peculiar altar. Typical novice stuff, nothing that would challenge a master of his craft such as myself.
{{200879108-0-79021:}}But of course! You'd be a fool to think that a treasure hunter as respectable as myself would have no experience with a simple tile puzzle!
{{200879108-0-79020:}}Together? Us? Gods, no. Whatever she told you, our relationship is strictly professional. Employee and employer. An explorer should have only so many servants in the field, and Elfbetta fills three roles at once. Maybe four.
{{200879108-0-79029:}}This is but one piece of the puzzle, proxy. You still need to investigate Ostumir and Rustwall Estate. Determine why the threads of fate there are frayed.\n\nFind me at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad when you are ready to report.
{{200879108-0-79028:}}One more piece of the puzzle remains, proxy. You still need to investigate Rustwall Estate. Determine why the threads of fate there are frayed.\n\nWhen you are finished, find me at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad.
{{200879108-0-81623:}}We greenspeakers use ritual magic to enhance their growth. They go from fragile little pods to full houses in a matter of weeks.\n\nIt's all part of the Green Pact, you see. We protect the forest and, in return, the forest protects us.
{{200879108-0-81553:}}If helping Ithelia saved reality, then you made the right choice. But the Lamp of Clarity is a powerful relic. I am glad you found it.\n\nI would like to take the Lamp to Beragon's townhouse for further study. May I have it?
{{200879108-0-81583:}}Call it a hunch. But if I'm being honest, I have no idea what it will do. It might fling you right into Oblivion. Or turn you into a netch.\n\nThe anchors seemed important. At the very least, destroying them is better than leaving them be.
{{200879108-0-81582:}}They weren't soldiers. No one trained them for any of this. I can't blame them for making too much noise. Or being too slow with a blade. I tried to keep them safe, but it wasn't long before I was on my own.
{{200879108-0-81581:}}Almost positive. The Recollection swarmed the remaining cohort and the servants we were protecting. They worked fast. It was a slaughter.\n\nI'm lucky I lagged behind or they would have fallen on me, too. I managed to pull a few servants away, but ….
{{200879108-0-79097:}}Theft is a possibility, but this one thinks Lady Weatherleah hid her wealth before her death. Her will, and all those present in and around her death, may shed some light on the situation.
{{200879108-0-81587:}}Of course. I wish I could say I was surprised. Nantharion always had an answer for everything, but there was something … I don't know. Murky? Like mold beneath the surface.\n\nMy father is still stalwart as a spruce, of course.
{{200879108-0-81584:}}I don't know whether to dance or cry. I think I'll do both, after Clen and I have a few of Ciiril's potent drinks. \n\nI've been tense about this for so long, I almost forgot what it feels like to let go.
{{200879108-0-81589:}}Pig's milk! Primarily. It's my own recipe, so there's a bit of this and a bit of that in there for flavor and body. \n\nIf you like that, you should taste my rotmeth! I've been brewing a batch for Laeni's wedding ceremony since she was a baby.
{{200879108-0-81588:}}You should have heard him. The dawn's light is something we all have to look for! \n\nThe village comes first and only, in his eyes. He cries at night, when he thinks no one can hear. But always, the village first.
{{200879108-0-79348:}}The legionaries barricaded the area past the breach. Can't go through there. \n\nThere's a side entrance to the southwest. It's obscured by overgrowth, so there's a good chance it hasn't been noticed. We'll try that way. Then we find Commander Merian.
{{200879108-0-79349:}}Tough as forged iron and sharp as a rapier. I've seen him devise amazing strategies and accomplish seemingly impossible tactics.\n\nHe loves Colovia and will defend it with everything he's got. With him in charge, those Daedra are in for a fight.
{{200879108-0-80689:}}Fine with it? I was relieved! In families as wealthy as ours, marriage isn't like some Breton romance novel. It's business. Love never makes for good business.\n\nBut I never expected him to just disappear like that. It was rude and hurtful.
{{200879108-0-80687:}}I suspected something was amiss. Since I arrived, we haven't consummated our marriage and he spends his time down in the winery, locked in his alchemy laboratory with his mercenaries. Plus, he covets my family's fortune.\n\nBut a vampire? Makes sense.
{{200879108-0-80686:}}Ah, you saw my notes then. That's good, I'm glad Sariyaah had her pets to keep her company while I was away.\n\nPlease, go ahead and talk to her. I'll meet you in town when I can. I just need to gather what's left of my dignity before I see her.
{{200879108-0-80681:}}Hey now, this was a team effort. And of course, Ulfsild herself set the stage for our success all those years ago.\n\nMy usual day is filled with protection, patrols, and portals. This was a nice break from the usual.
{{200879108-0-80680:}}Now, if the question has an answer you haven't brought me an unsolvable riddle. But then that would mean you aren't her inheritor. And then how would you know what Ulfsild told me? \n\nAnd we're right back where we started! Clever, very clever!
{{200879108-0-78758:}}I'm not sure. If I understand the story of the relics, they were made to counter Ithelia. And she has the power to avoid detection. Hence, the Unseen.\n\nMy guess is the Skein can't spot her directly, but instead looks for places she exerts her power.
{{200879108-0-78753:}}You're not wrong, but what in life is ever guaranteed? No matter. We need to find out exactly what Nantharion did at these locations. And something there might point us to where he's going next.
{{200879108-0-81240:}}Things got better. I found new purpose, students eager to learn. New partners in research, and new partners in life. \n\nWhen I was a young woman, I was obsessed with the Scholarium. With the power of the Luminaries.
{{200879108-0-81241:}}Well, the Crow wants me to be Master of the Scholarium. She wants me to step into Ulfsild's boots. It's a bit overwhelming. Those are some big boots! \n\nBut knowing how much Ulfsild dealt with, all she went through and struggled.
{{200879108-0-81243:}}I'm going to start by convincing the Votary Commander to keep me assigned here. Scribing is a lost art form because Ulfsild worked alone and in secret.\n\nIf we open the doors of the library to the Guild ….
{{200879108-0-81245:}}If there's one thing about the adepts of the Mages Guild, they love an intellectual puzzle. Maybe, someday, there might be an altar like this one in every guild hall across Tamriel.\n\nBut that's for tomorrow. Today, we owe you an enormous thanks.
{{200879108-0-81852:}}I'm surprised to hear that. They were very much in love, when last I saw them. They knew they would not see the end, together. But they had made peace with that idea long ago.
{{200879108-0-79806:}}What a brilliant idea! Ach, sorry. Perhaps where you're from, that's an option. But not for us. \n\nWithout the blessing of our fathers, not a soul in Vashabar would accept our union. That's just how we are.
{{200879108-0-80917:}}Do not presume to remind me of the stakes we face. I brought you into this. I—\n\nGo speak with Scruut. I … I need to think.
{{200879108-0-80919:}}I think Vashabar is done with kings. Nantharion came from an old family in Silvenar, so the Bosmer who followed him accepted that title. I imagine they'll choose a new leader with a little more humility.\n\nGreenspeaker Darolith would be a good choice.
{{200879108-0-80918:}}I … I am sorry, proxy. I just—I need a few moments to myself.\n\nTalk to Scruut. She shall tell you what we have planned.
{{200879108-0-81656:}}I'm worried about her, too, friend. But Sorilen is no delicate bellflower. She's shown me time and again that she's perfectly capable of defending herself.\n\nLet's help the other survivors and then see if we can pick up her trail.
{{200879108-0-80958:}}Great job, friend! I'm so relieved! Head to Skingrad—Count Calantius has an office there, near the chapel. He'll want to reward you. I'll bring along Burnbiscuit and meet you there!
{{200879108-0-81959:}}I'd heard you were assisting the Master of Incunabula with a special project. Helping Shalidor himself, very impressive!\n\nUlfsild was just as talented as her husband, almost every ward is holding. Which makes our interloper all the more confusing.
{{200879108-0-78802:}}The chance that anyone's hearts besides our own are still beating in this town is next to impossible. I really want to deal with Balandrus … the Terror ….\n\nBut I suppose I owe it to Tham to go where he pointed. Let's check the bank.
{{200879108-0-81428:}}You mean Firandil? I reached out to him while I was waiting for the Votary Commander to decide what she wanted me to do. \n\nI've worked with him in the past and he's … unusual. But he's the best at what he does.
{{200879108-0-81429:}}Indeed, but I took the barest of tastes. Certainly not anywhere near the amount of grapes the death hound consumed.\n\nThe aroma says drink me, but the flavor … definitely not something I want to imbibe in great quantities. At least not in this form.
{{200879108-0-80954:}}I've heard whisper of liches in dungeons. Places like Fang Lair, Crypt of Hearts, and the Vaults of Madness.\n\nProbably not a good idea to go alone. Don't look at me, though. I've got to make sure that Fox fellow doesn't go after more books.
{{200879108-0-81419:}}I'm not sure we can fix them. Our best chance is to find Ithelia and return her to her prison. And you have the relics to do it! We just have to figure out how to restore their depleted energy. Let me think ….
{{200879108-0-79689:}}Yes … yes, you're on to something. Any parent could tell you, a suffering child is a petulant child. Perhaps Molag Bal delivers pain to others because he himself is suffering in his desire for pure free will, which he can never achieve.
{{200879108-0-79686:}}Agmund argues that Molag Bal simply existing implies that Aurbic forces wish him not to exist, and so in defiance he chooses to to do so. But that, then, implies that the universe at large is malign in nature, and wishes us to suffer.
{{200879108-0-81855:}}Each knight takes a solemn vow to protect the Mages Guild, its members and its goals.\n\nWhen we're available, we also go in first to deal with situations like this. Trying to assess the unknown before letting the adepts get their hands dirty.
{{200879108-0-81854:}}My plan is to bring in Irnard, who opened the portal for you, as well as Llaren and Julian. You passed them back in Sunnamere.\n\nAh, and Chronicler Firandil. He'll be invaluable here and can keep the other three in line.
{{200879108-0-81858:}}Yeah, swords always made more sense to me than spells. Portals and I get along great, something about how they come together. Like a good riddle.\n\nBut most magic and I just don't get along. Much to my father's chagrin.
{{200879108-0-78798:}}Not involved? Of course he'd say that! As for reporting to Nantharion, that depends on what we find. I serve Count Calantius and the Legion, not some self-declared king.\n\nLet's meet at the spot the greenspeaker indicated and go look for that seed.
{{200879108-0-78799:}}I was thinking I was performing my duty as an Imperial tribune. And I wasn't alone. I had legionaries with me. We fought our way through an army of Recollection until we reached this dead end—and got trapped by that portal.\n\nHow did you find me?
{{200879108-0-78796:}}The count doesn't know Nantharion. He and his Wood Elves showed up right after the new forest appeared without so much as a by your leave! Is it any wonder the count doesn't trust him?\n\nDid Nantharion say anything about the Recollection?
{{200879108-0-78794:}}Tham knew I was on my way. If there was something he thought I should know, he'd find a way to tell me.\n\nAnd on the off chance someone is alive in this blighted town, maybe we'll find them, too.
{{200879108-0-78795:}}Oh, I'm counting on it. I want that bastard to know I'm coming. When I left, I tried to put this behind me. But now Balandrus calls himself the Terror. Now he's hurting this town ….\n\nI swore the next time I drew this blade, it would be to end him.
{{200879108-0-78793:}}I told you I used to run with the gang. And those Spenard twins were bad even before Balandrus took on the name, Terror of the Weald.\n\nBut they're also cowards. Won't raise a finger without Balandrus's say so.
{{200879108-0-78790:}}I don't know what to expect. But I plan to put my sword through anything that moves unless I'm certain it's not a vampire. I have no desire to feel the sharp prick of fangs on my neck again.\n\nStill, I can hope. Let's search the tavern.
{{200879108-0-82105:}}Yes, yes. She hoped that with proper technique and a sufficiently powerful focus anyone could develop the same … relationship with magic she had.\n\nShe spent the work of lifetimes pursuing that dream. And never quite saw her work bear fruit.
{{200879108-0-81507:}}It's not, really. The place was donated to the guild sometime around its founding. The oldest books found here were from the early middle of the first era.\n\nShame they weren't kept in better condition. A lot of these books have been lost to time.
{{200879108-0-82102:}}Ulfsild saw the world differently. She could literally see magic, watch as it spiraled in ribbons across the world. \n\nAs she grew up and formally learned to cast spells, it gave her a perspective on magecraft no one else had.
{{200879108-0-81505:}}Ithelia is the reason behind all these occurrences. We need to understand what she's doing and why. But if we lose Feldagard Keep to a Recollection assault, Skingrad might be next.\n\nBoth are equally important, so you'll just have to choose.
{{200879108-0-80726:}}Magic weavers that speak to the Green. We shape the living wood that make up our homes. It's an ancient art form, and I'm proud to carry on the tradition.\n\nVashabar would never have grown without my father and his magic. Obstinate old ash.
{{200879108-0-80720:}}Let's see.\n\nAh! Right at the top here. The Daedric ruins. I don't know the name, but they're on an island southeast of Vos. If only the place were still full of chickens like the fable says.
{{200879108-0-80721:}}Let me see.\n\nThis bit at the end that mentions Azura's Coast, I bet it's referring to Sadrith Mora and Tel Galen. Just plot a course between those two towers and I bet you'll find the door. That's what you're looking for, right?
{{200879108-0-81504:}}Well, in addition to the memory you saw of Ithelia heading toward the inn, Leramil says there are tangled threads of fate converging in that area.\n\nWhatever's going on there, you need to help Leramil figure it out.
{{200879108-0-80776:}}I don't know. The clinic says he's beyond their help. If I could just speak to him one more time. Put our bitterness behind us, and ease his passing. \n\nBut it's too late. My father is in his final moments, and has no idea I'm even here.
{{200879108-0-81226:}}Ulfsild gave up so much to develop the art of Scribing. The Scholarium was her home. And the Luminaries were her family. \n\nOn the precipice of losing everything, she spread her wings and soared. She enacted a rite, the ultimate act of Scribing.
{{200879108-0-80950:}}I chose to be a bulwark against the hordes, and I'll ask you to do the same. I will summon a list of safeguard tasks. \n\nComplete the ones that appeal to you, I will rally my strength. And we will see what happens next.
{{200879108-0-79594:}}She's been mouthing words at me over your shoulder. Meet her where we began the ceremony to grow Vashabar. She thinks a dormant seedpod will represent her quite well.\n\nI'll mark your map and we'll see you beyond the village. Laeni, we get to stay!
{{200879108-0-81227:}}She gathered every scrap of evidence she found during her time with the Luminaries. And created one of her own.\n\nA wellspring of magic, the heart of the Scholarium, was expended through the Scribing altar. And I was born.
{{200879108-0-78645:}}I have! Lord Valente was generous enough to let all the vineyard workers and servants have a glass before the guests arrived.\n\nIt was salty and crisp with a slight metallic aftertaste. Something to do with Lord Valente's alchemical process, I think.
{{200879108-0-81275:}}You're just here to talk? Every word I speak splits these scars again! And yet the pain of my burns pales in comparison to that in my heart. This is for them!\n\nYou dare to ask me about my son? My wife? You don't even know her name!
{{200879108-0-78974:}}They were. Did something divert them? While Fargrave is a realm of limitless portals, including many that are permanent, the plane can play havoc with portal spells.\n\nNo matter. There is no time to search for them. We have problems of our own.
{{200879108-0-78400:}}We don't honestly know, which is why we need someone to learn more about them. Gather the items I mentioned and bring them to me. Then I can get Legion beast handlers and the Mages Guild to study them and tell us more.
{{200879108-0-80988:}}I am. In the end, as she always was, Ulfsild was right. I cannot be its only defense. With the help of my companion you will borrow protective magic to reinforce our own.
{{200879108-0-81835:}}I didn't see the crack at first. The light through the window went dark, which was eerie enough. When I poked my head out to look at the sky, there it was.\n\nIt might be my imagination, but every time I look up, I swear those cracks get bigger.
{{200879108-0-81550:}}Precisely! Nantharion used the staff to prepare the wildburn seed ritual before you stopped it. I think the Skein is showing me places where Nantharion is using the staff to plant more seeds. A lot more.\n\nSo, friend, want to help me stop Nantharion?
{{200879108-0-81551:}}Not since we left for Niryastare. Leramil said that while we looked for the Skein, she'd continue her search for Torvesard. She expected that might take her far beyond West Weald.\n\nI wish she were back. She understands all this better than I do.
{{200879108-0-81552:}}Daedric relics are her specialty, not mine. Leramil could have figured out how to use the Skein of Secrets with a single glance.\n\nWell, since we don't know when to expect her, we'll just have to do the best we can on our own.
{{200879108-0-78858:}}The battle inside was fast and brutal. A few of us were able to retreat, but I had to send someone back in to ignite the signal fires. Legionary Thania volunteered instantly. No hesitation whatsoever.\n\nI'm glad you were able to complete her mission.
{{200879108-0-79726:}}Listen, I'm just the crew boss. I hire quarriers and keep them busy. If you have questions beyond that, you need to talk to Lady Raxalee. She owns the quarry and knows a lot more about what you're asking than I do.\n\nNow, I have a quarry to run.
{{200879108-0-79723:}}Ah, I see. I had an appointment to speak to her late father. Unfortunately, he succumbed to that terrible malady before that occurred.\n\nI'll tell you what I planned to tell him. No crime plagues the town of Ontus. Just a lamentable disease.
{{200879108-0-79516:}}Maybe. Well, I don't know. I'm lost. And drunk. Very drunk.\n\nI just started a new job. At a vineyard. Somewhere in West Weald. I don't know my way around here that well.
{{200879108-0-78728:}}He said it was too good not to use. That the Wood Elves wouldn't mind since there were so many new trees anyway. I told him it was a bad idea, but he was so stubborn.\n\nI'll make whoever killed him pay.
{{200879108-0-79410:}}Yes! We three are the Burning Wild Band! Because I found these two in the wild and, well, l'm a bit singed myself around the edges. Sorry. \n\nAnyway! We'll perform in Skingrad soon, before Count Calantius himself!
{{200879108-0-79415:}}That doesn't sound good. Shardmarshal Vargas is here, too. I was hot on their heels, but they stepped through a portal at this blocked passage. I couldn't follow.\n\nWe've got to find another way to reach the deeper halls.
{{200879108-0-79758:}}I've been all across Tamriel, even visited places off the continent. And I've been to Oblivion. But I can't picture what a completely different reality even looks like. I suppose it's sort of like when Alea and I were trapped on the Many Paths.
{{200879108-0-80545:}}He came back from his travels … different. Even his father was concerned about the changes in his beloved son. But shortly after young Gallio returned, his father fell ill and died. Gallio inherited the vineyard, the title, and all that entailed.
{{200879108-0-81354:}}I lost a lot of good men and women to these Recollection fanatics. The last report about them urged caution, but it never said they had their own army!\n\nWere you able to complete the mission? Did you ignite all four signal fires?
{{200879108-0-81350:}}Ont me. Ont you. Ont us! Conjugation! Got it. \n\nI'm gonna go. To the Ontus. Bye, now.
{{200879108-0-79659:}}I think you can. What are your thoughts on the paradox? Maybe then we can put our debate to rest and focus on getting to Skingrad.\n\nYou should hear both our opinions on the matter before you decide.
{{200879108-0-81358:}}That his followers are in danger. While drawing Wood Elves away from the Green is next to impossible—Greenspeaker Sorilen notwithstanding—the followers of the Dawnway are ripe to be recruited by the Recollection.\n\nThe king needs to know.
{{200879108-0-81712:}}Hermaeus Mora found a distant reality where neither magicka nor Daedric power can exist. Ithelia showed him the path and he opened a portal. And thanks to you, that portal and path were destroyed. \n\nShe poses no danger there and cannot return here.
{{200879108-0-81710:}}Ithelia provided me with wisdom. To see, for a moment, as she sees.\n\nI could not make sense of everything, but the possibilities of the Many Paths stretched before me. Curate Gadayn … he still exists … somewhere. I think.
{{200879108-0-82064:}}Rut it all, no! Those things are corruptions, transformed into something foul. The faithful who started the wildburn should be dismembered and used as fertilizer.\n\nThe greenspring seed we're looking for is as pure as a forest spring.
{{200879108-0-79140:}}I am the son of a noble family of Silvenar, House Ryl. Under the Second Empire, we ruled with little interference from Cyrodiil or Elden Root. Many Elves still remember those days with fondness. I accepted this crown when the people offered it to me.
{{200879108-0-78677:}}He couldn't have, he'd never make a mistake like that. And he was nowhere near the tea that morning. I started a pot for Lady Weatherleah and Pelena took over brewing it before I left.
{{200879108-0-81011:}}Do not fear, mortal. I have a plan. My scions will one day set me free, after I have had sufficient time to figure out how to avert the disaster Mora predicts.
{{200879108-0-81010:}}The Prince of Fate foresees a cataclysm approaching. I used my ability to manipulate the Many Paths to prevent one disaster, but now Mora sees my efforts as the predecessor to something even more terrible. He feels he must imprison me.\n\nAnd I agree.
{{200879108-0-81650:}}That deserter isn't a legionary, not any more! And, yes, I plan to hunt him down and make an example out of him. No one questions the orders of Captain Dartorius and gets away with it!\n\nUlrath will wish he died with the rest of the squad.
{{200879108-0-81012:}}Accepted? All that I am will soon vanish from reality. How could I possibly be comfortable with annihilation?\n\nNo, I feel dread. Resentment. Anger. And totally ashamed by my obvious weakness.
{{200879108-0-81015:}}The Daedric Prince of Secrets knows how to hide stuff. He's always doing projects, the Gryphon says, so he's always using creatia.\n\nWe just have to be as crafty as he is! Lucky for us, you've got that lens Ulfsild made all those years ago.
{{200879108-0-81014:}}Mora's army has surrounded the shrine and will soon pour in. I will have no choice but to let them imprison me. My followers may be locked away as well. Or scattered across Oblivion.\n\nIt does not matter anymore. Let them come.
{{200879108-0-78332:}}A wise question. Preparation is a keen blade in battle!\n\nWe have observed that each incursion begins with the arrival of a fearsome Mirrormoor champion who anchors the incursion to our world. Defeat the champion and the incursion fails.
{{200879108-0-78715:}}I can't fight like you, but this? This I can do. I'll stay until I'm relieved of my post by the Legion or the bandits. Whoever reaches me first. \n\nMaybe this will show everyone that the people of Ontus aren't all cowards and deserters.
{{200879108-0-80666:}}It's been years since I read it. I just can't remember ….\n\nWait, that's right. I didn't read it, I heard it. A Baandari trader, this old ja-khajiit that came through our village. No wonder none of the others here remembered wise Mizbi.
{{200879108-0-80663:}}I've already given you clues. But while Ulfsild toiled alone, that was her choice. One that spoke volumes. \n\nYou should reach out to your knight, consult with the Crow. Whatever you must to achieve the task I've put before you.
{{200879108-0-82056:}}Oh, right. Nantharion told you I was called Beragon Sharp-Dagger, the hero of Ninglenirre Pass. Look, I happened to be in the right place at the right time. I helped save some Wood Elves caught between bandits and a rampaging lurcher.\n\nNo big deal.
{{200879108-0-81699:}}I mean, I tried. There used to be a lot more wall back there. The portal didn't like me trying to go through one bit.\n\nRaw magical energy came bursting out. I'm just lucky I wasn't scraped up too bad.
{{200879108-0-81698:}}Fair enough, I'll answer what I can. What would you like to know?
{{200879108-0-82135:}}Which is why I have promised our greenspeakers will help heal the area of devastation. \n\nAs for the new forest, those roots cannot be returned to their seeds. Vashabar will be a good neighbor, though. On that, you have my word.
{{200879108-0-79440:}}Jagga? From Ciiril? For me? What's this all about, stranger?
{{200879108-0-79442:}}Those two could give lessons in cussedness to a timber mammoth. And now they'll be looking for the loving couple. Damn.\n\nMy niece can't leave! If only … hmm. If their fathers won't budge, can we convince Laeni and Clendagal to stay?
{{200879108-0-79664:}}I felt that Molag Bal being alive implies that Aurbic forces wish him not to exist, and so in defiance he chooses to remain alive. That implies that the universe at large wishes us to suffer, which would be both amusing and sad.
{{200879108-0-78834:}}Not quite yet. Stopping the Terror won't be as simple as just killing Balandrus. We need to destroy his weapon stockpiles and shatter his army. Maybe something in the alchemist shop can help with that.\n\nBut first, we need to deal with this worm.
{{200879108-0-81925:}}In the great Mages Guild hierarchy it's a bit of an informal title. \n\nIt's passed around by a few adepts, like myself, with a penchant for the identification and illumination of ancient secrets.
{{200879108-0-81928:}}Isn't it beautiful down here? Just exquisite chisel work on the walls. When the Votary here described this place …. Well! \n\nI just had to come along. And I'm so very glad I did.
{{200879108-0-81229:}}I have watched you and Nahlia as you have struggled through the trials. Life is a maze. Legacies are a blessing. And the burdens of both should not be endured alone.\n\nYou are a master of Scribing, but I can already sense other adventures await you.
{{200879108-0-80133:}}We can't, not without their totem. Until they get it back, they won't appoint a new shaman. And whatever happened to the previous one seems suspicious to me.\n\nWe should investigate the Sharp Tooth camp next. It's just southeast of Gray's Hollow.
{{200879108-0-80132:}}Nothing good. The missing totem is already enough to get the Goblins angry and mobile. But the dead shaman explains the chaos. They're scared and unorganized. Desperate.
{{200879108-0-78691:}}Grape pulp left over from the Vesper Valente wine, waxflower petals to hasten the recovery process, and Imperial oak tannins to make the remedy effective topically.\n\nFind those items around the winery while I make preparations.
{{200879108-0-78697:}}I thought she was acting strangely, but I blamed it on the grief. I would never have expected her to be capable of all this. And what of … Uriel? What was his role in all this?
{{200879108-0-78695:}}To think this one nearly forgot about our remaining, golden thread. Aquilia is the only living relative. Mizzik supposes she will inherit the fortune. Not that we've found a single coin to give her.
{{200879108-0-80447:}}Thank you!\n\nI hope this works! I was making good progress earning these Goblins' trust, but Jerntann's actions might have ruined that. Well, there's only one way to find out.
{{200879108-0-79668:}}Yes … yes, you're on to something. Any parent could tell you, a suffering child is a petulant child. Perhaps Molag Bal delivers pain to others because he himself is suffering in his desire for pure free will, which he can never achieve.
{{200879108-0-80491:}}What happened to the squad? She's what happened to the squad! She froze when we spotted the Daedra. Refused to give a coherent order. I stepped in and she went crazy. Commanded the squad to engage a massively superior force. Then she turned to flee.
{{200879108-0-79095:}}Mizzik is not sure what to think. <<1>>'s death appears to be an accident, a simple fall, but she sent for Mizzik in distress just days before. This one believes something happened to her. And there is of course her missing fortune.
{{200879108-0-79090:}}We know the real Uriel went to fight in Varen's revolt and that Lady Weatherleah spent a fortune to find his body. We also know from the note in the lady's study that Pelena was against looking into his death.
{{200879108-0-78322:}}As I've said, they are not native to West Weald and none of the mages or alchemists I spoke to have ever heard of such creatures before. Are they dangerous? That's more important than where they come from and what we need to determine.
{{200879108-0-78321:}}I am a commandant in the Imperial Legion, assigned to the Third Cohort in Skingrad and currently serving as an attache to Count Calantius.\n\nI have been tasked with evaluating threats and securing mercenaries such as yourself to deal with them.
{{200879108-0-78320:}}Believe me, I would rather send trained legionaries, but there are none to spare. When Emperor Varen disappeared, cohorts from across the Empire were summoned to Imperial City. We barely have enough soldiers to protect Skingrad, let alone the Weald.
{{200879108-0-78327:}}I don't want to worry you, but the Legion isn't exactly what it once was. Between the uprising that saw Emperor Leovic deposed and the ongoing battle in Cyrodiil, we lost a lot of good soldiers. Now, there are more threats than we can handle.
{{200879108-0-78326:}}Reports are sparse, so not much. He's a Wood Elf spinner and a member of the Recollection. Our scouts saw him preparing a ritual in the overgrowth to the southwest.\n\nThe only thing I despise more than magic-users is not knowing what they're up to.
{{200879108-0-78325:}}Well, between the new forest to our west and reports of strange crystalline creatures attacking travelers and trade caravans, we certainly don't have a shortage of mysteries to deal with.\n\nAre they all connected? I have no idea.
{{200879108-0-78324:}}Anything that threatens the safety of Skingrad and West Weald. As I said, just a few years ago, Count Calantius and the Legion would never stoop to hiring common mercenaries. But times change.\n\nIf you're willing to help, you will be paid well.
{{200879108-0-78329:}}What sorts of threats aren't I talking about? There's trouble coming at us from every direction. The encroaching jungle and Daedric incursions are just the tip of the sword.\n\nThat's why Count Calantius and the Legion decided to hire mercenaries.
{{200879108-0-78328:}}We think the spinner is using strange mushrooms to power his ritual. Without knowing more about the specifics, the safest course of action is to burn the mushrooms and disrupt the ritual.\n\nMy superiors don't appreciate loose ends and neither do I.
{{200879108-0-80849:}}Your most important find are these mudcrab apples. Look at the dainty toothmarks on them—Burnbiscuit definitely nibbled on them. He may have dragged off a bag of them. We can follow the trail.
{{200879108-0-80848:}}We do not want to use the knot or claim it. We want it stabilized and secure.\n\nIf we can place the knot in the null arca—and stabilize the knot's chaotic nature—this one is sure that will stop whatever terrible fate befell the other expeditions.
{{200879108-0-80845:}}Think of reality as a mirror. If it breaks, you have two mirrors, yes? \n\nThe knot treats the mirror as if it never broke. It bridges the gap between the shattered edges and helps them touch once more.
{{200879108-0-80844:}}The One Who Knows has not made that clear to me. Yet as long as reality persists, we still have a chance to prevent Ithelia from undoing … everything.\n\nConclude your business with Beragon, proxy. Our work is not yet done.
{{200879108-0-80847:}}Keshargo would also like to know what happened to them. He has access to books and journals kept by other hopefuls, but no explanations.\n\nBut, this one is hopeful. Just because something has not happened yet, does not mean it never will.
{{200879108-0-80840:}}The east wing, looking for anything Ulfsild might have left behind about the Gryphon. Hopefully she'll get you pointed in the right direction.\n\nMy deepest apologies. This was a grave error on my part, but it won't happen again.
{{200879108-0-80843:}}She usually has it in her bed chambers, but the room's been locked this whole time. It seems in the commotion, the key has been misplaced. It's likely her room has remained untouched since this whole tragedy began.
{{200879108-0-80842:}}Apparently so. He considered himself the heir to that empire and planned to destroy West Weald to rebuild it. Some things are just better left buried.\n\nAnd seeing Ithelia restored was … terrifying. I wonder what she plans to do with all that power.
{{200879108-0-79441:}}My sister sent you? And with jagga no less? Hmm. What's my sister up to this time?\n\nWell, I'll drink with you stranger and hear what you have to say. Ciiril does make some mighty fine jagga.
{{200879108-0-79445:}}Nedolir will not bend. Minth will not sway. They revere our culture, but learn nothing from the trees.\n\nIf the couple chooses to leave, I will not speak against them. Every living being must be allowed to grow as it wills. So says Y'ffre, so say I.
{{200879108-0-79444:}}Clendagal, leave? But the village is freshly grown! And it feels like just yesterday I was helping him choose a training blade. \n\nI know how much he loves that young woman. If they think they have to leave town to be married, well ….
{{200879108-0-79446:}}A look at … a rite? I don't. Oh! Yffre's arse, this is amazing! Where did you dig up this relic?\n\nIt was Spinner Belwelas wasn't it? Canny old goat. Hah, what a find! Nice work, traveler!
{{200879108-0-79449:}}You should have seen me waving my arms around to get Clen's attention. A seedpod's perfect. The dormant greenspring seeds are what remains of the ritual we used to grow Vashabar. \n\nThey're sacred to us, carried all the way from Valenwood.
{{200879108-0-79448:}}An old scroll? Huh, I've never heard of this before. The Rite of Propagation? We gather some symbols, present them to friends and family. And ask the village what it thinks we should do. \n\nTraveler, with this we might not have to leave!
{{200879108-0-79780:}}Take my word for it, she's one of our best. Professional. Highly focused. A tad overworked, maybe.\n\nSome say knights in the Order of the Lamp are just failed mages. Those people haven't met Nahlia.
{{200879108-0-81926:}}I most certainly hope so! This place is massive, and any assistance they might put forward would be deeply appreciated.\n\nYou can tell them that Chronicler Firandil said so, when you speak to them.
{{200879108-0-81929:}}A powerful Daedric Prince who once threatened all of reality. A conspiracy of Daedric Princes locked her away and Hermaeus Mora wiped all memory of her from every mind.\n\nShe escaped her prison and now roams free. Her threat looms again.
{{200879108-0-80406:}}It was the last job the Scarlets ever did. We weren't killers. We never were, not even when living as outlaws.\n\nBut our break-in at Caelum Vineyard cost a family their lives. One was a child only a few years younger than Noraine.
{{200879108-0-81197:}}Haldain thought the new forest would be the perfect place to set up a lumber camp. It wasn't too bad of an idea until the animals took offense. They stormed through and tore the place to shreds.\n\nIt's like the forest itself is punishing us.
{{200879108-0-80239:}}One thing to always keep in mind is the need to experiment! Heed my instructions and you will go far, assistant!
{{200879108-0-80232:}}If searching through a few Goblin camps to see what's upsetting them is all it takes to stop a tragedy from happening, I'll do it. Come with me? There's a Bitterfish camp not too far.\n\nI have some funding left over. You can have it if you help.
{{200879108-0-80231:}}These Goblins are more aggressive than usual. It's almost as if they're getting ready for war. When Goblins fight, they make trouble for everyone.\n\nGoblins aren't stupid though. They wouldn't get this aggressive without a cause.
{{200879108-0-81190:}}Consider it done.
{{200879108-0-81191:}}We need to cut off their access points and slow down their advance through the keep. Since they're using ropes to scale the walls, burning them is essential. And the traps should slow them down.\n\nWith any luck, they'll regroup at the breach.
{{200879108-0-81192:}}Yes! See, just like your knight said we're pretty high up in the air. The way forward is on the far side of this maze chasm thing. \n\nThe path to get there is very narrow. And invisible. And mostly marked by scent. But that's why I'm here!
{{200879108-0-81193:}}This is—was his lumber camp. If he's dead—and if I make it out of here—I'll drink to his memory. \n\nIf he's alive, well, I don't think he'll blame me if I turn down his next job offer.
{{200879108-0-79849:}}An ancient agreement that prevents many of the most powerful Daedric Princes from directly manifesting on Nirn. Ithelia was imprisoned long before the deal was struck, so she and the Daedra that serve her are not party to its restrictions.
{{200879108-0-79848:}}That is not an easy question to answer. Ithelia is a Daedric Prince. No mortal can match her power without assistance. Nor can Hermaeus Mora move against her while she walks our world.\n\nHe is bound by the Coldharbour Compact while Ithelia is not.
{{200879108-0-81611:}}Ugh, why do you insist on prolonging my suffering? I don't suppose I can stop you, though. \n\nAsk your questions. I doubt my answers will make any difference to you.
{{200879108-0-82147:}}I should be thanking you. You were fate's chosen. I was merely along to guide you on your … path? But what did you call it? A vacation? I am not sure I have ever had one of those before.\n\nPerhaps our paths shall cross again, friend. I hope so.
{{200879108-0-82148:}}I believe some rest and relaxation are in order. I hope to take Curate Gadayn away so we can get to know each other better. The Speiran Tarn can be quite lovely when the tomeshells are migrating.
{{200879108-0-78920:}}The field hand assumed you were a guest of the auction, and the invitation did say to bring my most-favored mortal servant.\n\nIf anyone asks, you're the blood servant of Master Bogvir, the vampire I shall pretend to be and whose invitation I carry.
{{200879108-0-78928:}}We'll find them again. We dealt them a serious defeat here at Hoperoot. They'll need to regroup with Recollection forces elsewhere. That will cost them time.\n\nThat staff. Vargas called it the Staff of Many Paths. She entrusted it to Nantharion.
{{200879108-0-81449:}}Oh, the usual. Advancing my studies, investigating for House Ravenwatch. I must say, I do like West Weald's climate. Much less damp and chilly than what we have over in Rivenspire.\n\nI will tell Adusa and Gwendis I ran into you, though!
{{200879108-0-81444:}}Seek my annotated fable at the meeting of many paths. A room full of doors with no hinges.\n\nA riddle, indeed, the first of many. But I have faith you'll find your way.
{{200879108-0-81445:}}The antechamber to the main hall is a portal room not just because it's convenient, but because it was easy. \n\nI could sense spell hooks aplenty in that room, dating back to Ulfsild's era. They used that chamber for the exact same purpose.
{{200879108-0-81443:}}He … that is … I am glad that Gadayn is well.\n\nBut now we must return to Fargrave and make our way to the chamber of the Loom. I dare not open a portal there directly, as the release of power when you destroyed it has made the area unstable.
{{200879108-0-81441:}}You helped Ithelia remember herself? Isn't that what the Recollection is trying to do? I suppose you had a good reason, but still!
{{200879108-0-78993:}}I am not sure—that is why I asked you to investigate. Ostumir is a Colovian town in the Strid Vale, not far from the southern edge of the new forest. I have heard stories about powerful groundquakes and enraged forest creatures in the area.
{{200879108-0-81670:}}I am, though it will be quite the challenge. My life, my career with the guild, has been one thing over and over again. Now, here? I'm not sure I'll ever repeat the same day twice. \n\nThanks again for that, by the way. Completely your fault.
{{200879108-0-79232:}}Yabren's back? I assumed she was fighting in Cyrodiil or guarding the count's precious bear. If this is about Ulbren's suspicions, I'll tell you what I told the healer. My quarriers enjoy the rewards that come with hard work. Illness is not an issue.
{{200879108-0-79237:}}Did it? I don't recall any standing appointments. The constable always treated me with the respect I deserve.\n\nHe never found it inconceivable that Emperor Leovic personally granted an Argonian an Imperial title. Not like Baron Carvain.
{{200879108-0-80377:}}Feh. Let them try!\n\nYou said Hooke told you about this killer? He must be lonely. We agreed to split up for good after everything that happened. Now he wants us back?
{{200879108-0-80376:}}Of course. This chase has been running for some time now. \n\nAnother moment to clarify your mind, improve your focus, will not hurt.
{{200879108-0-80374:}}If magic is a river, we are eddies in the current. We are not masters of the river, but we are a part of it. The river is us, we are the river.\n\nEach of us awakened in a different manner, time, and place. I am the oldest to choose my form, I believe.
{{200879108-0-80373:}}The act of Scribing is really quite simple. You focus your will, put ink to parchment, and scrawl your soul upon the page. You change the magic, and the magic changes you. \n\nFocus your intent and fire becomes frost, venom becomes shock.
{{200879108-0-80372:}}To consider the meaning of power. Every being alive thinks they understand it. But how to gain power or what power to gain is not the crucial question.\n\nHow should power be used? That is what drives me.
{{200879108-0-80371:}}I would be disappointed if you did not. Scribing is an art esoteric, translating the very stuff of magic into mortal hands by Luminary liaison.\n\nThere's much you do not understand. Yet.
{{200879108-0-80370:}}It's a typical Colovian village, or rather, it was. Known for fishing and trade. As I understand it, when this forest sprang up a few months ago, it caused massive damage and drove the villagers away. They were starting to return when this happened.
{{200879108-0-78613:}}Some things, yes, but there are still heavy clouds. For instance, it's clear mother's riddle was meant for me, but I can't make sense of it. I can only hope your talented investigative skills solve this mystery.
{{200879108-0-78612:}}Six years ago I left to fight in Varen's revolt. I was gravely wounded and left for dead, and would've died had a caravan of Khajiit not stumbled upon me and taken pity. The Khajiit could heal my wounds, but not my memories. They were lost.
{{200879108-0-78611:}}Frustratingly, no. But my aunt spent countless coin searching for Uriel. Even if his story is true and he lost his memory, she would've found him. I fear Uriel was lost to us in the revolt and this man is wearing our grief like a disguise.
{{200879108-0-78610:}}I believe it was one of the estate's remaining workers. Pelena would know more, she was here when it happened. Unlike Uriel. I know grief can cloud one's judgment, but is she not at all suspicious of Uriel's story?
{{200879108-0-78617:}}From what I've been told my mother lived her final years grieving in isolation. My dear wife Pelena did her best to keep her company, but my mother had no friends or visitors. Aside from the hired help of course.
{{200879108-0-78616:}}All this talk of suspects when the woman simply fell. Though, I suppose Thunderboots would not be here if the death weren't suspicious. Speak with the staff yourself if you see fit.
{{200879108-0-78615:}}I fear Aquilia has merely succumbed to her own grief. Chasing phantasms with bloody daggers. My mother was a wonderful woman who died a simple death. It is sad, but common. You come to understand this when you've been to war.
{{200879108-0-78614:}}Every single one. I rode with the caravan until I was fully healed. It wasn't until we rode into Skingrad that the first slivers of my past began to return. By the time I remembered my name and where I lived, it was too late. Mother was dead.
{{200879108-0-78619:}}Yes, I caught Edric snooping around my private quarters. Terrible thing, having one's privacy encroached upon. I told him to never return or I'd have Betu chase him out. I admit, I did enjoy striking fear into that sad little man.
{{200879108-0-78618:}}No, I was not. Lady Weatherleah was kind enough to let me live on the estate when Uriel went off to fight, but I often spend my mornings walking through the woods. A ritual that has helped ever since Uriel's death—absence, I mean.
{{200879108-0-81034:}}You're looking for local creatia, a big splinter kept safe by his Dremora soldiers. \n\nOnly problem is, you'll need a spellforged key to unlock it. That chest is unpickable. You can't pick it!
{{200879108-0-81025:}}I was in charge of the maps. The citadel is in ruin, so parts of it are impassable and others haven't been charted at all. \n\nOur leader is a great cartographer, but I guess his attention was needed somewhere else. I had to plan our routes.
{{200879108-0-79372:}}At Chorrol. It was horrible. Rifts and fissures opened up in the earth. The town in flames. My unit destroyed. I'm no coward, but you can only fail people so many times before you have to choose between fleeing and embracing the madness. I fled.
{{200879108-0-80967:}}Ugh, I hate admitting it's such a major part of my personality, but it's my vanity. \n\nI believe she's somewhere in Dawnwood, which is essentially the most dangerous place she could be.
{{200879108-0-81752:}}Stentus and I were out scouting. We got caught out there when the Daedra swarmed toward the breach.\n\nIf not for you and the ballista, our bodies would still be out there.
{{200879108-0-80651:}}Ulfsild struggled with my puzzles alone. It was her choice, but it made her miserable.\n\nYou, mortal, are welcome to confer with others to solve these riddles. Ulfsild's inheritor or not, this will be fascinating to watch. Good luck.
{{200879108-0-80656:}}Ugh. Let me see. Huh. The Riddle of the Game. Prestige and patron's love? \n\nThat sounds like you need to beat someone in a Tales of Tribute match. And before you ask, no, I don't have time for one. Not that you'd beat me, anyway.
{{200879108-0-80657:}}Delightful! Hmm. This Riddle of War, here. That must be Cyrodiil. \n\nI interpret this to mean you're hunting treasures in Haynote Cave, Cracked Wood Cave, and Toadstool Hollow.
{{200879108-0-81757:}}Rustwall? That's too close to Skingrad for comfort. What were they doing there?\n\nAnd I've heard of Tribune Alea. She commands a Legion cohort and handles special tasks for Count Calantius. If she fought the Recollection, I should look her up.
{{200879108-0-81231:}}Indeed. Nahlia, Knight of the Lamp. Do not shirk from my gaze. You have proven yourself, side by side, through challenges of the mind and heart. \n\nI would have you take up the mantle of the Scholarium's librarian. Its master.
{{200879108-0-81230:}}Excellent. Then that just leaves my sigil. Ulfsild's sigil. After she completed the rite and left me to safeguard the Scholarium, she took that symbol with her.\n\nI sense its final resting place. Along the water's edge in the hold of Eastmarch.
{{200879108-0-81238:}}As I cast this echo, surprised how easily the magic came back to me, I have much to be grateful for.\n\nI'm a respected hedge wizard in Skyrim. They know me only as a compassionate, wise teacher.
{{200879108-0-78703:}}I don't deserve your kindness. Please, save those I couldn't. The weight on my heart will be so much more bearable when this is over. If I may make one last request? Show them no mercy.
{{200879108-0-78704:}}I'm certain of it. Those relics are being used to channel their rituals. When I became baroness, I promised to put the people of Leftwheal first. I thought, with the gold, we could expand.\n\nNow they've paid the price for my poor judgment.
{{200879108-0-81613:}}What does it look like? I'm waiting here for the sweet embrace of death.
{{200879108-0-81593:}}It happened at the start of the usurper war. The Daggerfall Covenant sought North Hook as a base from which to invade Imperial City. We didn't want them there.\n\nWhen my commander fell, I took charge. Eventually, we repelled the invaders.
{{200879108-0-81596:}}I sent my Legion cohort here. The best soldiers in the Weald.\n\nThe estate's proximity to the city makes it strategically important. I wanted to make sure we weren't surprised from this direction. But something happened here. We need to find out what.
{{200879108-0-82146:}}Eh, back to cataloging and research. Examining contradictions in the threads of fate. Doing what I can to rectify them. But will the Great Eye appreciate my efforts? Sadly, probably not.
{{200879108-0-82149:}}Wood Elves love their epithets. You've seen me use daggers. Someone called me that once and it stuck. At least until I retired and became a scribe. In fact, because of all the stories she heard growing up, Eveli took the name Sharp-Arrow to honor me.
{{200879108-0-80107:}}Sure, the new forest sprang up in a part of West Weald that was mostly wild and uninhabited, but it's still part of the province. No one in Vashabar swears allegiance to Count Calantius. What's he supposed to make of that?
{{200879108-0-82417:}}The Archmagister asked that I not say too much in earshot of my guildmates.\n\nLet's just say it's a magical anomaly. Untamed power from an unknown source. Plenty to catch a mage's interest, but that's just the trouble. It could be highly dangerous.
{{200879108-0-82418:}}For now. Power draws mages like moths to a flame, we're a little hopeless that way. \n\nVotary Nahlia, a knight from the Order of the Lamp, is on the scene. She needs someone to help her explore this anomaly and assess the danger. What do you say?
{{200879108-0-80929:}}Haven't you realized by now that the Great Eye doesn't share the whys and wherefores with the hired help? But if Hermaeus Mora tells you to spin, you ask how many revolutions.\n\nAnd yes, I'm speaking from experience.
{{200879108-0-81657:}}You've been away from the forest for too long, friend. A Wood Elf never forgets the sight of a Greenspeaker whispering to a tree as it curls into a home. Without their nature magic, our forest settlements would be impossible.
{{200879108-0-80926:}}Where we were, but now along a different path. That is the nature of the Many Paths. They can carry you to new possibilities, new realities. But the rest eludes me.\n\nWhy this path? Why this reality? I should be able to see but I cannot.
{{200879108-0-80925:}}Worried? How could I not be? I know nothing about Oblivion planes, except that mortals don't belong there. I'd much prefer to spend my whole life in our own world, thank you very much. \n\nOur enemies aren't giving us that option, though, are they?
{{200879108-0-79666:}}Then whichever Legion stronghold hears the chimes won't consider it a call for aid, and we won't get the reinforcements we need to take back the fort.\n\nLook, my recruits may not be seasoned yet, but they've got promise. We just need a little help.
{{200879108-0-79662:}}The question comes from the initial assumption that Molag Bal is subject to the metaphysical rules of the universe, which we call the Aurbis. If that's true, then is he truly a being of pure domination?
{{200879108-0-80073:}}Let me see that journal. By the stars! He killed his own father? And he plans to kill me? He's a cretin and a monster!\n\nAnd yes, pouring wine into people just so you can eat them and gain unnatural power is pretty bad, too. Damn it, I drank the wine!
{{200879108-0-81964:}}We're all in above our heads here. Don't look to me for answers. Luckily, our foxy friend might have helped us out. When he saw me, he dropped one of the pages! \n\nIt's the first page to the fable, with Ulfsild's notes clear as day.
{{200879108-0-79699:}}Why, yes. I wasn't aware you and the despot were on a first-name basis. Regardless, the diplomat bears his seal and speaks with his authority. They want the trinkets and the count wants to return them.\n\nHe'd prefer to just resolve this situation.
{{200879108-0-79651:}}Agmund and I travel annually to the Temple of Julianos in Skingrad to challenge the sophists and mystics in friendly debate.\n\nBut we were so engaged in our discussion that we took a wrong turn. Looks like our wits need to be sharpened, indeed!
{{200879108-0-79652:}}It goes as follows. Molag Bal is the Daedric Lord of Domination. He always opposes the wishes of others. If everyone would express the belief that he exists, would he therefore cease to do so because his nature demands he oppose the wishes of others?
{{200879108-0-79657:}}Julianos is the divine of wisdom and logic. His chapel attracts philosophers seeking to explain the Mundus. Agmund and I met at a similar gathering in Abibon-Gora. We got into a heated debate over the ethics of conjuration magic.
{{200879108-0-81808:}}This style of architecture dates back to the late Merethic era. It combines majesty with practicality, so probably a place for Daedra worship and training.\n\nThese Ayleids seem to have been particularly fond of someone they called the Prince of Paths.
{{200879108-0-81809:}}As I said, I plan to keep some of their attention on me instead of you. After that, well, I'm very stealthy. I have no doubt I can elude their patrols.\n\nAnd if I do get into trouble, I'm sure you and Beragon will come to my rescue.
{{200879108-0-81806:}}Bug shells! Surprise ruined! I wanted to show him the wildburn seed. Talk to him. Discuss the Recollection, both the good points and the bad.\n\nI suppose he'll want to take the seed before the Recollection does. I suggest you hurry. They're close.
{{200879108-0-81802:}}I suppose that's only fair. It may be a moment before they tally up my tab. It appears my delight was a big spender.\n\nPlease, ask your questions. I could use the distraction.
{{200879108-0-81803:}}Haven't you ever given into your feelings? Stopped thinking and just acted? It was something like that.\n\nMy facets are pure emotion. When they shattered, there was no logic. They simply followed their urges.
{{200879108-0-81800:}}Oh, many things! She had a distinct lack of tendrils. It was very memorable. Her familiar, the Crow, was almost as memorable.\n\nAnd she had that … oh, what's the word? The bearded creature she was fond of, Shali-something. Shali-boring, maybe?
{{200879108-0-80936:}}The best of friends! He's not … the best conversationalist right now? But just wait, when he's back to his normal self he'll be a joy to talk to.\n\nJust one more key fragment to go.
{{200879108-0-81412:}}It's worth a great deal, but is it worth our lives? I think we should consider ourselves lucky that we weren't mortally wounded in the attack. It's the little victories.
{{200879108-0-81518:}}One portal to Ulfsild's ancient study, coming right up. At least we won't have to do any climbing this time. Oof. Let's go.
{{200879108-0-81510:}}Let me see … hmm. The Luminaries all have different opinions on where they came from. They started arguing and to keep peace she decided to try a different riddle.\n\nSo she left to think in … wait. Really?
{{200879108-0-81511:}}Sunnamere, the study, the ruins where you and I met. That was Ulfsild's study. Huh.\n\nIf she has any notes on what she did next, what riddle she ended up giving the dragon, I bet they're at Sunnamere.
{{200879108-0-81512:}}Generally far too dull for my tastes. Somber. Heavy.\n\nBut I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Offering knowledge keeps me buoyant.
{{200879108-0-81514:}}Of course. I thought you might have things to ask, Not-Ulfsild. Your mind flows like a netch's. Breezy. Quick. Absorbent.
{{200879108-0-81515:}}You know how some people just have trouble floating? He's like that. Nirn is a river, and I feel along the bottom for things to make float.\n\nHe's one such soul. I've picked him up and put him back together before. But this must be the last.
{{200879108-0-80407:}}About three rungs on the command ladder hierarchy. I lead the cohort, but Captain Leronus usually served as our field commander. While I handled strategy and logistics details, he oversaw the forces on the ground.\n\nWhatever killed him will pay.
{{200879108-0-81482:}}He is loyal, perhaps to a fault, a quality that we both share. When we first met he was attempting to save a life, and I felt compelled to intervene. \n\nJust another creature to protect. Sheltering beneath my wings.
{{200879108-0-81483:}}I would call what we have a partnership if he had any interest in making decisions. \n\nHe is fiendishly clever, and unless I'm mistaken I would not be talking to you today if not for him.
{{200879108-0-81481:}}Yes. Animated armor based off of Ulfsild's design. Sentinels that can stand guard even when my gaze falters. \n\nAll those years ago we felt there was no pressing need …. Until it was too late.
{{200879108-0-81486:}}Elves have carved the shape of winged beasts since before Mankind existed. I am a symbol. And top of mind or not, symbols have meaning. \n\nSo I am the Gryphon. Sharp of talon and beak, wings to block the sun. Justice incarnate.
{{200879108-0-81487:}}The casting required a lengthy ritual. A vast pool of magicka. Built day upon day. Only to rush forth in a great flood.\n\nWhen the dam burst, there was still a great reservoir left behind. One that coalesced, distilled, into me.
{{200879108-0-81484:}}Our differences, I think, do not weaken us. But instead make us stronger. I act as a shield for the weak. He aides me in my calling. And we enjoy our time together. \n\nWhat else would you ask for in a companion? In a friend?
{{200879108-0-81485:}}I am not so old as the Indrik, not so young as the Netch. \n\nI was born from another's death, a great sage who stood against a terrible enemy and burned them out from within. A mighty and beautiful spell that cost them their life.
{{200879108-0-78671:}}Oh, yes, of course. No. I must have gotten ahead of myself. Yes, that's it. All this death. I thought I left it behind on the battlefield, but it seems to have followed me home. Whether murderer or murderee, my heart goes out to Edric.
{{200879108-0-79070:}}Patient? I suppose she is. She tends to fret and worry too much about me, and she's always underfoot when I need time to think. But yes, she's a very effective employee.
{{200879108-0-78670:}}In part. But I also wanted to set things right. I admired Marius, but he abandoned his post in Cyrodiil and hasn't been seen since. They call him the Ontus coward. The deserter. I want to prove that not all the people from my town are like that.
{{200879108-0-78808:}}Assaulting a Recollection camp isn't our objective. Leramil says we need to find the Skein of Secrets. That's likely somewhere in the vaults of Niryastare.\n\nI recall a set of stairs leading down in the middle of the ruins. We should start there.
{{200879108-0-78735:}}Ithelia, the Daedric Prince you and Leramil are looking for? You met her? Incredible! But why is the Recollection looking for her? Didn't they—ah, never mind.\n\nI think you should talk to Leramil now. I need to consider all this.
{{200879108-0-79851:}}Find her. Observe her. Discover her plans. Use the Echonir to reveal her memories.\n\nMora chose you and requested I assist you. He believes you can help preserve reality from Ithelia's threat, so we must trust that he shall guide us along the way.
{{200879108-0-81135:}}Your vow has been sworn.
{{200879108-0-78274:}}By magic or might, I'm unsure, but yes. They seemed to follow her every command. Once the beasts were between us and the dowry she swooped in and stole caskets and coffers filled with gems, jewelry, spices, and silks. I need them back!
{{200879108-0-79504:}}Yes, of course, a delightful woman. In fact, she was the one who often made the ride out to our lumber yards to collect my letters to Amaurel. Are you implying that I should marry her instead?
{{200879108-0-80529:}}Mortals! I think it must be your pitifully finite existences that make you so impatient. The threads of fate weave through the fabric of reality in complex and very specific patterns. To repair the tears, you must match that inestimable precision.
{{200879108-0-79505:}}It is a repository of knowledge from Valenwood, a connection to the deep history of our people. \n\nI hoped the Singer might send you my way. I believe a text from the hall may offer a solution. Seek out a scroll called the Rite of Propagation.
{{200879108-0-79507:}}No, I'm sorry. If they want to go, I respect their decision. But I'll go find Ciiril. Hopefully I can see the couple before they depart the village.\n\nHeh, I'll kick Clen in the arse if he tries to leave without saying goodbye.
{{200879108-0-81726:}}I love them! Julian hates them, Llaren seems indifferent, and Irnard says he likes them but I think he was just trying to be nice.\n\nHow do you feel about them? Do you like riddles?
{{200879108-0-81725:}}You're a step ahead of me, comrade. I hadn't heard about recent trouble at that poor town. Not since the new forest overwhelmed it.\n\nAs soon as I can, I plan to pay this Beragon a visit. Compare notes. Maybe I'll see you there.
{{200879108-0-81723:}}That's up to Count Calantius. I'll advise him to keep legionaries at the estate, even when no dignitaries are present. Problem is, we don't have many left to allocate here.\n\nThe Legion isn't what it once was, what with the Empire in disarray.
{{200879108-0-81720:}}I did. I am a scholar of Alessian legend, and what more appropriate patron for a Tribute deck than the Lady of Heaven herself?\n\nOnce gathered, the cards focus on mustering the might of her rebel army to overwhelm your foes.
{{200879108-0-80894:}}Of course! Right now we're deep beneath the island of Eyevea. Centuries ago Eyevea was a sanctuary for magic founded by Ulfsild's husband, Shalidor.\n\nEyevea was stolen from Shalidor by Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness, in a wager.
{{200879108-0-80895:}}We're all in above our heads here. Don't look to me for answers. Luckily, our foxy friend might have helped us out. When he saw me, he dropped one of the pages! \n\nIt's the first page to the fable, with Ulfsild's notes clear as day.
{{200879108-0-82038:}}The Votary is, as she's no doubt mentioned before, very talented with portals. Popping out of one space and into another. \n\nIt's something I quite enjoy as well, and her skill will allow you to see this trial through to the end.
{{200879108-0-82039:}}Possibilities, probabilities, places where fate takes a different course. Some lead to here, others to there. And a few, they lead to … elsewhere.\n\nBut this place. It has something I need.
{{200879108-0-82037:}}I am an attractive, floating, be-tendriled entity of humor, enlightenment, and magic. But even I, the Netch, cannot stop a soul from moving on to Aetherius when its time comes.
{{200879108-0-82034:}}How can I not like a fellow flyer? She plays along with my games, acting like she's annoyed by my clever tricks. But I see through her. \n\nI know the Crow enjoys my puzzles in the library. I ought to pay her a visit soon.
{{200879108-0-82032:}}My perfect form does not have eyes, Not-Ulfsild, but I want you to imagine I have them. Now imagine I am rolling them.\n\nShe thinks herself oh-so-clever, but ignores even simple truths when they're right in front of her snout.
{{200879108-0-82031:}}He means well, but I think over the years he's lost sight of what he truly wants. At least now, thanks to you, he can shake the frost from his wings and try to find new purpose.\n\nHis foxy friend practically levitates, though. Love that little guy.
{{200879108-0-79743:}}Briefly. I thought I noticed something but I was wrong. Besides, he died before we could talk more.\n\nLook, the illness is bad, but my remaining quarriers are more than making up for the workers we lost. Beyond that, I have nothing more to say.
{{200879108-0-81667:}}Yes! We'll have to get Archmagister Vanus down here to see everything we've been working on. Lots of paperwork, Irnard is already getting into it. But I think the commander was pleased, in her own way.\n\nThere will be so much work to do. I can't wait!
{{200879108-0-80678:}}Ulfsild says here, she told the Dragon how to recognize her inheritor. But she told you not to say yes when the Dragon asked. That's it. Ulfsild set this up for you all those years ago.\n\nYour riddle is "Am I Ulfsild's inheritor?
{{200879108-0-81740:}}Firstly, that riddle has an answer. They disappeared. Secondly, riddles to which you do not know the true answer are not in the spirit of the trial. \n\nBut then you already knew as much, mortal.
{{200879108-0-80515:}}No. I didn't want to hurt anyone I knew. Ursilia, my family. So I simply left. Eventually Count Verandis found me and made me part of House Ravenwatch.\n\nRivenspire is a long way from Summerset. And West Weald is farther still. I never expected this.
{{200879108-0-80836:}}I'm not too familiar with the Rift. But I do know that the Treva is a river that splits the hold. Maybe follow it south from Nimalten and see what you can find?\n\nJust remember, what was a castle overlook back then might just be ruins now.
{{200879108-0-80831:}}Strong drink fogs the mind, right? Makes some pains less sharp. But doesn't her mind seem clouded already, maybe even stormy?\n\nI think she wants a drink that will provide her with some clarity.
{{200879108-0-81321:}}I'm a legionary in the tribune's cohort. I do whatever she orders me to do. Besides, I'm on light duty while I recover from the injuries I sustained at Rustwall Estate. And it isn't like she has a lot of other choices until she rebuilds her cohort.
{{200879108-0-81320:}}Hah! Looking to save some coin?\n\nLaurina keeps all records of her tavern in a ledger in her house. You may have to bust the lock and be sneaky inside. Tear out the right page, and I can leave with my tail intact.
{{200879108-0-81325:}}Once a place gets a bad reputation, it's hard to shake it. And the vampires killed a lot of people … did a lot of damage ….\n\nWell, I suppose I can help deal with any of the Terror's gang that are still prowling around. That's something, right?
{{200879108-0-81324:}}I would have to consider your arrival an act of divine providence. I would gladly meet with Hooke as you ask.\n\nBut in good conscience, I can't ask someone to enter Varen's Watch. It's dangerous. Be careful in there. Please.
{{200879108-0-81006:}}Each reality bound by the Many Paths contains a version of an entity, mortal or Daedra. They each differ in some way, but each springs from the same seed.\n\nI am no different. She and I are the same, but distorted, like an image in a cracked mirror.
{{200879108-0-81004:}}Mortals are servants performing tasks to maintain reality. Every field plowed, child born, or war fought keeps the Aurbis stable by design.\n\nThis fact is kept from them. The slave should not understand the master's plan, lest they seek to undo them.
{{200879108-0-81005:}}The mortal mind is limited. Intentionally so. Comprehending the Many Paths should overwhelm you, and actually traversing them should be impossible. I can barely do that.\n\nYou are unique among your kind. Thus the title I give you—pathwalker.
{{200879108-0-81002:}}Possibilities scatter across the Aurbis, each defined by distinct choices with unique outcomes that lead to new realities.\n\nThe Many Paths are the web that binds them. Some can traverse these connections, as you have done here.
{{200879108-0-80679:}}How do you know what Ulfsild told me? Unless you are her inheritor. You never claimed to be. Which, from what the Archmage said, would suggest you are.\n\nIf you are, then I've definitively answered your riddle.
{{200879108-0-81000:}}All right miss big tough adventurer. I know for you going to a Daedric realm is like going to a corner bakery to buy some bread.\n\nBut the places we'll be going are being watched. We have to be … subtle. And subtle is my middle name!
{{200879108-0-81001:}}All we have to do is find somewhere the connection between Nirn and a Daedric realm is thin enough for me to wiggle through. \n\nLike digging a tunnel from one den to another. Easy!
{{200879108-0-79520:}}Things were going along swimmingly, when out of nowhere, my associates, a band called the Recollection, turned on me! I barely escaped with my life! Now I need someone to recover the Emblem of the Last King!
{{200879108-0-79521:}}Yes, one of the symbols of office of King Dynar, last of the Ayleid rulers. I thought the Recollection would be interested in the discovery. Apparently they were too interested, and chased me out. But we're going back and will retrieve the Emblem.
{{200879108-0-79528:}}The one with the grapes. They give you a few bottles when you sign on. I thought West Weald wine would be piddly, like Elf wine. Let me tell you. It's not.\n\nSo, which way should I go? To get … somewhere. Anywhere. Preferably the vineyard.
{{200879108-0-79529:}}Skingrad? Who is Grad and why are we skinning him? Oh! \n\nOh, you mean the city of Skingrad. Right. Off I go.
{{200879108-0-80283:}}Very well. One cask of West Weald Wallop. Our establishment is not responsible for any injuries obtained in the course of your inebriation.
{{200879108-0-80282:}}West Weald Wallop, you say? That's our finest ale, and it doesn't come cheap.
{{200879108-0-80286:}}It's quite simple: stand in one and peer through the lens. Hidden magics in many forms will be revealed to you.\n\nDoors, glyphs, even secrets layered within tomes. But here, enough talk. Let's begin.
{{200879108-0-80754:}}We were foraging in Faro's Cavern, Lazlus and me. We heard a terrible ripping sound and there it was—a tear in the space before us!\n\nNever seen the like! It was full of … nothing! But Lazlus got too close and he was just … gone. So I ran.
{{200879108-0-80751:}}I saw a shape in the darkness. Looming like a storm cloud. Tendrils swaddled me like a babe. I did not fight as they held me close, set me on my feet.\n\nAnd I heard that laughing voice, from all those years before.
{{200879108-0-79898:}}Hopefully you'll learn exactly what a Luminary is while you're at it. I'm lucky you were here, traveler. My magic is so specialized. \n\nWith that altar, who knows what else you'll learn to do? What sort of spells and skills you'll create?
{{200879108-0-79897:}}To inherit Ulfsild's legacy. To make your mark on spellcraft itself. The Luminaries wait beyond these beautiful sealed doors.\n\nIf you're willing, I will guide you on the path of Scribing. I will take you under my wing.
{{200879108-0-79895:}}Archmage Ulfsild the Evergreen? Warrior-witch of Kyne's Aegis? Clever woman of the Druadach? The Pale's priestess of Jhunal?\n\nShe created the Scholarium, and perfected the art of Scribing.
{{200879108-0-81961:}}I managed to catch sight of our pest just before you arrived, and it's … well. It's a fox. Possibly the fox Ulfsild mentioned in the echo?\n\nIt was enormous, and seemed intelligent. Honestly it looked very surprised to see me.
{{200879108-0-81962:}}I managed to catch sight of our pest just before you arrived, and it's … well. It's a fox. Possibly the fox Ulfsild mentioned in the echo?\n\nIt was enormous, and seemed intelligent. Honestly it looked very surprised to see me.
{{200879108-0-81263:}}I will search for my little ones. If the worst comes to pass, I will bury them in the fields where we used to pick flowers.
{{200879108-0-81969:}}Certainly. Centuries ago, long before the founding of the Mages Guild, it was an island in the Summerset archipelago. \n\nShalidor purchased it from the High Elves in trade for some magical artifacts he'd found in his many adventures.
{{200879108-0-81260:}}I was a stable hand. Modest work, tending to the horses and whatever types of beasts travelers rode in on, but I enjoyed it. There's something fulfilling about being able to calm a beast and tend to its needs.
{{200879108-0-81261:}}It's embarrassing to admit, but most of my time in Leftwheal was spent in and around the tavern. I've got an itch for gambling that needs tending to and the merchants here earn so much coin they're practically giving it away.
{{200879108-0-81264:}}Unlikely. I'll follow the injured wherever they go, which I am certain will be far from here. Many of the civilians that weren't first evacuated suffered grievous injuries. I'll make sure they have the strength to reach a sickbed in Skingrad.
{{200879108-0-81265:}}I'll sharpen my sword and get back into the fray as soon as the pain in my chest subsides. You've stopped the flow of monsters, but I'm certain Leftwheal will remain infested for some time.
{{200879108-0-81269:}}The Recollection found a way to breach our walls. I don't know how, but the chaos was almost instantaneous. One moment I was treating a child's scraped knee and the next I found myself tying tourniquets and shielding civilians.
{{200879108-0-82007:}}Oh! You worked with a Daedric Prince? That's so neat! I um. I bet that was exciting. Did you get to shake his tentacles … or. \n\nAnyway, hopefully we'll still be able to keep a low profile over there.
{{200879108-0-82009:}}You went up against the Lady of Shadows? And survived? Whoa, amazing. Listen, I kind of hate Evergloam. Too spooky for me.\n\nI'll stay close to our entrance and you just try not to get caught, okay?
{{200879108-0-78307:}}She did. According to Scruut, there's an old forge deep within the mine that's dedicated to Boethiah. Leramil and her believe that if you present the sword at the forge, Daedric energy will once more flow into the blade.
{{200879108-0-82514:}}The ranch makes a substantial profit providing food for the town and the region. While the quarry has had some success, since the war for the throne heated up it's begun to challenge the baron's status and put a strain on their relationship.
{{200879108-0-82511:}}Not much to tell. We're a small town full of hard-working people. Most everyone is employed by the Carvain Ranch or the Raxalee Quarry. Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee have always had a sort of friendly rivalry, but lately it seems … less cordial.
{{200879108-0-82513:}}He was? That's a good question. I suppose maybe it was a little strange that only people who worked at the ranch or the quarry were getting sick. Until that is Healer Nevama and Ulbren got ill. The disease came upon them and they died very quickly.
{{200879108-0-81378:}}You know I love riddles! It sounds like you need to manipulate the fires so that only two braziers are lit.\n\nEach brazier is named for a Luminary. Feathers but no wings … that has to be the Indrik. But two of them have feathers and wings both.
{{200879108-0-81379:}}Maybe … oh! I get it. The room is arranged like the Scholarium, but the gate is at the Crow's door and the west brazier is the altar.\n\nIt has to be the Indrik and the Gryphon.Light the northwest and southeast braziers!
{{200879108-0-81374:}}You restored the original relics used to capture and imprison Ithelia. And we created the Mirror of Truth to try to show her the monster she has become. All we need to do now is travel to Apocrypha and locate her.
{{200879108-0-81376:}}Apocrypha, like all Oblivion realms, is infinite. But we have the Skein of Secrets. I shall open a portal. Use the Skein once we cross into the realm and see if it can pinpoint Ithelia's location.
{{200879108-0-81377:}}Haven't you been paying attention? This is the very threat that Hermaeus Mora contracted you to help stop! You've accomplished a lot as fate's chosen, but Ithelia is still out there, loose and destroying reality one piece at a time.
{{200879108-0-81370:}}I remember the armies of the other Princes pounding on the doors to my shrine. My loyal Shardborn readying their weapons. The sounds of unrelenting battle.\n\nI recall the Princes standing in judgment over me. Then, blackness.
{{200879108-0-78888:}}Our clearest indication as to the Forgotten Prince and her scion's activity is the news that Scruut has brought us, but even that is circumstantial at best. We must investigate these instabilities and determine the true cause behind them.
{{200879108-0-78889:}}While I admit that I'm not as comfortable here in Apocrypha as Leramil, I have steeled myself for the experience. And Scruut provided me with a way out.\n\nShe said it would take me to Skingrad. Apparently to the home of someone named … Beragon?
{{200879108-0-82006:}}I think it's called chreesha? Creatia? It's the stuff that the Daedric Princes use to make their realms. \n\nI just have to follow my nose!
{{200879108-0-79289:}}The Lamp of Clarity, which you recovered from the Outcast Inn, was crafted by Azura. She wrought the Lamp to illuminate the Many Paths. To make the Unseen … seen. \n\nOnly one of the three relics remains to be found—the Skein of Secrets.
{{200879108-0-79280:}}Elfbetta, of course! Yes, I could use some help. First, you must know I am the noted explorer Narsis Dren. You know the name, of course. World-famous adventurer and author and all that. I've been exploring the Ayleid ruins here at Wendir.
{{200879108-0-79287:}}My appointed tasks range far beyond West Weald, proxy. While you deal with Ithelia's servants Nantharion and Vargas, I seek her first scion. Torvesard, the author of all these troubles.\n\nYou and I shall cross paths again soon enough.
{{200879108-0-79285:}}Ah yes, the case of the Maelmoth Mysterium. You'd be surprised how often that sort of thing happens in this line of work.
{{200879108-0-82129:}}Which brings me back to you. I know you didn't walk this path alone. I made sure of it. I hope it was worth it.\n\nTake from this place the Sigil of the Crow. And know that Ulfsild the Evergreen never forgot her magical friends.
{{200879108-0-79753:}}You do realize, proxy, that the fabric of reality is a metaphor. A way to easily explain a concept that is nigh unexplainable.\n\nBut to answer your question, yes. We have accomplished what Hermaeus Mora originally asked us to do and preserved reality.
{{200879108-0-79752:}}Sure, I helped. But I was doing my duty. I serve count and country. You have no vested interest in West Weald, but still you risked everything to save us.\n\nAnd you figured out how to exile Ithelia. That's impressive from where I'm standing, comrade.
{{200879108-0-78579:}}He's one of countless pampered nobles that look at these marvelous, newly grown woods and see only a profit to be made. They have no love for its beauty, and nor do I for their greed. So forgive me for not considering what he deserves.
{{200879108-0-78573:}}In better days, Fort Colovia was a prominent stronghold for the region. Even protected gold from the Imperial Treasury on its way to distant parts of the empire. But that was a long time ago. Now the place is rundown and used to train new recruits.
{{200879108-0-79238:}}Glad to hear that young Yabren has gotten right to work. Her father would be proud.\n\nBut I am uncertain as to what I can tell you that would help advance her investigation. What exactly is she investigating, by the way?
{{200879108-0-81356:}}King Nantharion's an interesting person. Charismatic, a visionary. He saw an opportunity and rallied Wood Elves to follow him and start this settlement. As I understand it, he leans toward the Dawnway more than the Green.\n\nWe need to warn him.
{{200879108-0-79236:}}My business is none of your concern. We struggled in the past and were almost forced to sell to Carvain, but we turned things around. All it took was a war, a demand for stone, and for our quarriers to work a little harder.\n\nNow, please leave.
{{200879108-0-81719:}}I did. I am a scholar of Alessian legend, and what more appropriate patron for a Tribute deck than the Lady of Heaven herself?\n\nOnce gathered, the cards focus on mustering the might of her rebel army to overwhelm your foes.
{{200879108-0-79234:}}Then let us speak of this no more. Be on your way, adventurer. And stay ready—I'm sure the Legion will have need of your talents again.
{{200879108-0-78825:}}We hid in here. Some miners, Tham, the banker and his husband, their clerk. My Grivier's been leading them to safety, taking them out in small groups. He's the best scout in the territory.\n\nBut now it's just me and my son. Grivier hasn't returned.
{{200879108-0-80350:}}Aye. No different than abandoning a ship when it sinks. We Scarlets are survivors. And that's what we did.\n\nTook a lesson from Moricar's Reachmen. They stole to keep their bellies full. So we did too. Everything but lives.
{{200879108-0-80749:}}Elic? Yes. This is where I learned of Elic. Near death. Perhaps nearer than I am now.\n\nI remember tendrils cradling me. Lifting me to the water's edge. My wounds, closing. Pain, easing. A voice that was joyous and clear.
{{200879108-0-80046:}}How curious. I offer you the power to maim or to mend. To blast with flame or freeze with ice. You would turn down such a gift?\n\nWe shall see. First, my door must open once again. Place the fable you carry with you upon the dais.
{{200879108-0-80040:}}The lands between Skingrad and Kvatch were all but abandoned after the troubles of the last decade. The Strid Vale was a frontier ready to be settled.\n\nWhen the Green extended the forest, I led my people out of Silvenar to build a new home here.
{{200879108-0-78376:}}Dro'vir thought the request was strange, too, but Lord Valente insisted. And Lady Valente specifically told Sentry Helvius to let the servants in, even if we didn't have the fancy invitations.\n\nIf you're here for the auction, you should head inside.
{{200879108-0-78377:}}Tell me he didn't send you. \n\nJust because I believe that the new forest isn't natural and poses a danger to West Weald doesn't mean that I don't support his business. I'm happy it's fruitful, but this forest isn't good for anyone.
{{200879108-0-78370:}}One of the noble houses of Rivenspire. We also just happen to be a coven of vampires. I suppose you'd call us good vampires. We only drink from willing donors and never to excess. Our mission is to hunt and put down the more ravenous of our kind.
{{200879108-0-78371:}}It's been in the Valente family for generations. From what I was able to ascertain, Lord Valente inherited the place about a year ago. Seems he returned from a long trip and his father suddenly fell ill and died. Now the place is under his control.
{{200879108-0-78372:}}Ugliest hounds Dro'vir has ever seen! This one just finished checking the new grapes and was on his way to the auction when it came out of nowhere. Ripped up Dro'vir's leg real good.
{{200879108-0-79135:}}The tribune sees a threat in the eyes of every Bosmer … but she may not be wrong. I've heard rumors. Secret gatherings, Elves taking up paths walked before we accepted the Green Pact. Some who follow the Dawnway may be tied to the Recollection.
{{200879108-0-79137:}}We had nothing to do with the appearance of Dawnwood. King Nantharion tells us that it is a natural extension of Valenwood. That its sudden growth is proof that we are meant to reclaim our rightful heritage of this land.
{{200879108-0-79136:}}Our new settlement consists of two Bosmer factions. Those who observe the Green Pact, and those who follow the Dawnway. These Elves cultivate crops and harvest wood. But they would never abuse the Green's gifts by corrupting a greenspring ritual!
{{200879108-0-79130:}}Ever the thoughtful scholar, my Narsis. Very well, I shall do as you say. Is there anything else I may do for you before I take my leave?
{{200879108-0-79139:}}I am the leader of the Dawnwood settlements of Vashabar and Hoperoot. The Bosmer I lead wanted no further part in the endless struggle for the Imperial Throne. So, when the Green extended the forest north into West Weald, I saw it as a sign.
{{200879108-0-79138:}}That makes no sense. No ritual I know of can make a forest grow so quickly. If the corrupted greenspring seed—this wildburn seed—is capable of that …. I really must study it. I need to determine if the seed's taint has spread into the Green.
{{200879108-0-80814:}}An idea, yes, although Scruut referred to it as a remote possibility. We should return to the Loom of the Untraveled Road. Perhaps the Echonir can reveal a lingering memory as to where Ithelia has gone.\n\nBut proxy, was Curate Gadayn … well?
{{200879108-0-80810:}}Absolutely, consider my trial passed! I'll summon up my sigil, and you can take it back to the altar. It is time for you to scribe up your own clever tricks.\n\nJust remember to stay light, stay breezy, keep yourself as netchy as you can.
{{200879108-0-80811:}}Now you're getting it. The best tricks are the ones nobody sees coming. A twist of fate, a bubble of hope, a glorious multi-limbed embrace.\n\nSeeing people happy is all for my own gratification. Selfish, I know, but I've been called worse.
{{200879108-0-79045:}}Animated stonework. Doesn't surprise me. They don't require much upkeep. But this altar! Ayleid design, so it will need some liquid to activate it. Hah! They have the keys but have no clue how to use them!
{{200879108-0-81797:}}Keshargo expects it will be difficult to miss. Some accounts he read described the knot as a ball of yarn. Others mentioned that it was bright and shining like a torch. This one is not sure which is true.
{{200879108-0-81402:}}I saw signs of this ancient magic from an early age. Certain fables seemed to sing with this same magic. Only when I was grown did I revisit them.\n\nThat was how I found the Indrik. And the Indrik is who I urge you to seek out first.
{{200879108-0-81403:}}Tilt your head and think of the altar as the heart of the Scholarium. Without it, the library would simply be a graveyard of tomes. A lifeless shell filled with old knowledge and stories of the past.\n\nWhat makes that heart beat? What gives it life?
{{200879108-0-81400:}}The Outcast Inn? Of course. That helps explain some of the markings on the encoded map we found.\n\nSo not only did we stop Nantharion from unleashing a new wildburn against Skingrad. We learned Feldagard Keep is in danger. And that's not all.
{{200879108-0-81401:}}A look through the lens will allow you to see impressions left behind by the Luminaries. Follow these signposts, and you will find their domains.
{{200879108-0-80207:}}No, we do not. Torvesard told us in Mephala's Nest that the Skein was lost in an Ayleid vault.\n\nGiven the Recollection's interest in Niryastare, I think we know which one.
{{200879108-0-80209:}}Daedra don't change! Daedric Princes especially. It's their nature! We're not like you mortals, constantly reflecting on possibilities and remaking yourselves over and over.\n\nShe's a monster and will always be a monster.
{{200879108-0-81404:}}Yes. Before the doors were sealed the Indrik, Netch, Dragon, and Gryphon fed the altar their strength. \n\nNow the heart of the Scholarium struggles to beat. And without that beating heart, your mastery of Scribing will stagnate.
{{200879108-0-81409:}}Sadly, I did not. When we came around the bend there was this horrible buzzing sound and then we were overrun. Before I knew what had happened I was beaten to a pulp and our assailants made off with our wine.
{{200879108-0-78737:}}He did? Apologies for my terse greeting. If you still came here after hearing what's happened then you're braver than most. I'll take all the help I can get putting a stop to this Recollection invasion.
{{200879108-0-79816:}}Lots of little things. The season wasn't right, we were helping establish the village.\n\nHonestly, I think we both just hoped our fathers would see reason. But we're done waiting. It's time to act.
{{200879108-0-79817:}}Y'ffre help me, yes. Without my family's help Vashabar would never have been grown. Why wouldn't I be proud?\n\nAnd we call the forest Dawnwood for a number of reasons. A new day for my clan, for Valenwood, even for West Weald.
{{200879108-0-79812:}}We've plenty of family friends, but no one like that. Oak and burl, Clen and I both lost our mothers when we were young. It's one of the things that drew us together. \n\nWe need our fathers to consent, or we need to leave.
{{200879108-0-79813:}}My father's a greenspeaker and devout follower of the Green Pact. Clendagal's father is an important envoy for King Nantharion's Dawnway.\n\nIf they weren't so worried about appearances, they'd have punched each other in the bits by now.
{{200879108-0-79810:}}Most days proud, actually. I'm training to be a greenspeaker myself. Following along the leaf-trail of my father and his father before him.\n\nObstinate old graht-oak that he is, I love him, damn it. I just wish he'd listen to me!
{{200879108-0-80999:}}He didn't mention where we were going? Hehe. Silly Gryphon. \n\nYou and I are going to sneak into the realms of Hermaeus Mora, Mehrunes Dagon, and Nocturnal. We'll make away with some of their precious creatia and steal it back here!
{{200879108-0-80998:}}I've never heard of a seed, but the Wood Elves of Vashabar use wildburn to refer to the strange blight along the edge of the new forest.\n\nWorry about that later. Let's focus on finding Greenspeaker Sorilen before she runs afoul of the Recollection.
{{200879108-0-80993:}}Then we will find some other way to leave the sunken ruins. Perhaps we will climb up this room. Or we will break the barrier Xoryn placed behind us.\n\nBut in that time, Xoryn could have found the knot. Keshargo would like to avoid that if possible.
{{200879108-0-80992:}}This one needs a moment to catch his breath. Running long distances is not something that he was good at in his youth. If he is going to put his paws in danger, it will not be before he has recovered.
{{200879108-0-80995:}}You'll have to carry it back. \n\nHopefully, Xoryn won't bother us again. But this one suspects he will make an appearance. Xoryn's arrogance won't let him leave the knot in our care.
{{200879108-0-78878:}}I came here as part of a small adventuring company. Brave companions and good friends. Anyway, we found the stairs in the ruins and fought our way past a small horde of skeletons to reach this spot.
{{200879108-0-80982:}}I'm a sorceress. Daedric magic is just a tool, like a hairbrush or a dab of rouge. \n\nI was creating a spell to expedite my morning routine. Mirror magic is more powerful here. It was going swimmingly until the mirrors shattered and I did, too.
{{200879108-0-81658:}}Studying inscriptions in old tombs inspired me to become an Imperial scribe. I worked in Cyrodiil for years, recording documents and dabbling in history. Spying and creating ciphers, too, from time to time.\n\nThese days I make my home in Skingrad.
{{200879108-0-81440:}}According to the invitation I found, yes. And not just any vampire. He's the leader of a powerful coven. Which is why this whole affair concerns me. Ravenwatch has never heard of this coven or Valente before. And a wine auction? It makes no sense.
{{200879108-0-78382:}}Oh yes. Helping with the will is a cover. Not only was her death sudden and mysterious, but now her fortune is missing and her long-lost son has returned. A great many threads for one's claws to get tangled in.
{{200879108-0-80412:}}He's a pompous waste of horns if you ask me.\n\nXoryn's the reason our camp is in shambles. Somehow, he got it in his head that he owns the arcane knot.
{{200879108-0-80413:}}A powerful container capable of pacifying even the most chaotic of magical items. This expedition inspired me to make it.\n\nIf I can prove that it works, I can sell them. Imagine, all the unruly objects of Oblivion contained and secure.
{{200879108-0-80410:}}Our leader can speak to it more than I can. I just know that we needed to obtain a powerful and secret object from the depths of the citadel. \n\nNo one has ever succeeded in recovering it yet, but we had a plan. I hope it's salvageable.
{{200879108-0-80411:}}The assistant cartographer? I expected to find her under a pile of rubble.\n\nI assume she sent you here to help. But why send you to me specifically?
{{200879108-0-80414:}}He said his prince sent him on this expedition. If he was sent here, is he really in charge? \n\nI guess I should not be so harsh. Keshargo is leader enough now that the rest are recovering from Xoryn's attack.
{{200879108-0-80415:}}<You are about to enter a Trial. Are you ready to leave your current Zone?>
{{200879108-0-81436:}}Her regards? She did? What were Leramil's exact words, friend?\n\nNo, not now. We're in Apocrypha and we have a task before us. We must get your map to something sacred to Mephala.
{{200879108-0-81062:}}I know. I just haven't had the strength to return before now.\n\nMaybe reuniting with her would be nice. Less lonely.
{{200879108-0-80723:}}The real fable? Of course. I remember it well.\n\nLet's see, there was mention of the Zainab, yes? The ruins you seek are called Nchuleft. Be sure not to fall like the Ashlander in the story. The Netch may not see fit to catch you.
{{200879108-0-78952:}}Shardmarshal Vargas clearly intends to conquer West Weald for her Prince. She made that quite apparent at Feldagard Keep. But there may be another motive for the incursions. If Vargas keeps us busy here, we can't interfere with Ithelia's plans.
{{200879108-0-78824:}}Without Nantharion and with Torvesard off doing who knows what, the Recollection will be scattered and leaderless. Our battle merely shifts to a new arena now, with even greater stakes.\n\nAlready the threads of fate fray at an alarming rate.
{{200879108-0-78826:}}I'm just the town alchemist. I'm no expert on vampires. But Balandrus and his crew, they came here for a purpose. I heard one vampire say something about raising an army.\n\nYou seem like you can handle yourself. Can you look for my husband, Grivier?
{{200879108-0-78596:}}Bogvir! Of course!\n\nWhere is my old friend? Still upset about that little incident? No matter. I was hoping to clear things up before the auction got underway. Send him over to talk to me the next time you see him.
{{200879108-0-80080:}}You met a Daedric Prince? That must have been something. Not that I would know. Never had much use for Daedra of any sort.\n\nLet's keep going. Tell me if the Echonir has more to show us.
{{200879108-0-81970:}}I can't tell you all the details, just what I've heard. Old Shalidor wanted some tome, an artifact that Sheogorath had in his possession. And whatever the bet was, it did not go in Shalidor's favor.
{{200879108-0-81971:}}One of the reasons Guildmaster Vanus formed the guild in the first place was because of how … well. How toxic some cultures can be towards mages and magic.\n\nThat was long after the island disappeared, but in a way the dream of Eyevea lived on.
{{200879108-0-81974:}}Ulfsild's notes make him out to be something of a knight in the mold of the ancient orders. Strong, true, and unyielding.\n\nLet's hope he's willing to talk to some interlopers before he charges into battle.
{{200879108-0-81975:}}Magnus, I'm not sure that's possible! The Netch's joyous floating is a well, it's a singular experience.\n\nUlfsild's notes make him out to be something of a knight in the mold of the ancient orders. Strong, true, and unyielding.
{{200879108-0-80593:}}I know Narsis can rub people the wrong way, but I think that's just a part of his adventurous spirit. Don't judge him too harshly—it's what allows him to make all those great discoveries! \n\nAnd also occasionally gets him turned into a statue.
{{200879108-0-80591:}}Maybe? I wonder if anyone here can restore poor Narsis. He always dreamed of a statue, but I don't think this is what he had in mind.\n\nIf not, I'm sure there's something in his notes. It's not the first time he's gotten into trouble, you know.
{{200879108-0-80590:}}I asked them to trap some guzzards for me as pets—an adolescent and an adult. They remind me of my home back in Craglorn. I also lost my dear pet wormmouth, Versidue, on the journey here. If anyone can bring these creatures to me, it's Marcien.
{{200879108-0-80599:}}Certainly! I remember what a snake my husband was, even before he became a vampire. And I remember what you and Fennorian did to save the Valente Vineyards.\n\nMost of all, I remember why I agreed to come to this party.
{{200879108-0-80598:}}The Recollection grows more violent and reckless. Until Nantharion is defeated, no one is safe.\n\nDid you learn anything about where Nantharion was heading next?
{{200879108-0-80621:}}I think so. Maybe? I don't really know. Frankly, it's a big decision and the cure is hard to come by, but if I can keep my bloodlust in check ….\n\nI'll help Maerenah get Sutch back on its feet. Reopen the tavern. After that? We'll just have to see.
{{200879108-0-80625:}}Mizzik hopes so! This one intends to stay in West Weald for a while longer. There are many here that could benefit from Mizzik's deductive skills. Of course, this one must make do without your assistance, sadly. Hopefully our paths will cross again.
{{200879108-0-80624:}}Slowly. Some of Balandrus's vampires are still around, and a lot of the townsfolk who escaped the bloodsuckers haven't come back yet. Maybe they never will.\n\nBut I'm helping Tham get the tavern operating, and I'm showing him how to control his urges.
{{200879108-0-80627:}}I believe we respect each other. We've reached an understanding and continue to refine the details of a treaty granting Vashabar land rights and trade agreements with Skingrad and the rest of West Weald.\n\nPublic opinion could be our worst problem.
{{200879108-0-80626:}}Far better than I anticipated. I think in no small part thanks to you, Beragon, and Tribune Alea. The count is a fair if tough negotiator, but he understands that Nantharion and the Recollection are not Vashabar.
{{200879108-0-80629:}}As secure as it can be in this fouled up world. Oh, there are Recollection stragglers to drive off, and Count Calantius needs to finalize diplomatic relations with Vashabar, but we'll be all right.\n\nAt least as long as the war stays to the east.
{{200879108-0-80963:}}The threads of fate? That sounds ominous. But after what we saw down there, I'll keep an open mind. We learned that the Recollection cult is working with Daedra and taking orders from Shardmarshal Vargas. They got damn close to invading Skingrad!
{{200879108-0-80960:}}It does not look like there is another way out of this room, and Keshargo did not see one in the chambers behind us. \n\nKeshargo is no expert, but the ghost lights are behaving strangely. If you go up to them, they might help.
{{200879108-0-82008:}}Oh my gosh! How did you survive? How do you still have your eyebrows? That's amazing.\n\nListen, we should try to avoid drawing his attention while we're there. Whatever you did to fight him before … don't do that while we're there.
{{200879108-0-78965:}}What, after everything with the Recollection, you think I wouldn't want to see this through to the end? When Leramil summoned me and Scruut explained things, I readily agreed to help.\n\nNow, let's get moving before reality breaks down around us.
{{200879108-0-78978:}}Indeed. Clearly the Loom of the Untraveled Road is an apparatus of great importance. Vargas forgot what it was, yet its existence never ceased to gnaw at her.\n\nThis is where Ithelia's trail has been leading us. We must find a way to follow.
{{200879108-0-78979:}}Perhaps there is something more here than our mortal senses can perceive. In this reality, the archway and mirrors have long since lost their power. But in the Many Paths, that might not be so.\n\nUse the Lamp of Clarity, proxy.
{{200879108-0-79595:}}The Dawnway means so much to me and my family. It draws from Ayleid culture, and there are several Ayleid ruins nearby. \n\nA mosaic from the ancient empire of the Heartland Elves would perfectly represent me to the village.
{{200879108-0-79593:}}The spinner! I didn't even know he liked me. Thank you. You have no idea what this means to us. We've been on a blade's edge since we spoke.\n\nWe've already asked you for so much. If you're willing, do you have time to help us gather our symbols?
{{200879108-0-82117:}}That does not make the threat or the danger it presents any less real. Apocrypha and the Mundus both are built atop endless metaphors.\n\nNow, we have a plan to carry out, I believe.
{{200879108-0-80709:}}Ah, I should've guessed. You look like a sturdy oak, just the sort of person the Dominion attracts. I bet you'd never get caught up in these arguments about the Dawnway and the Green Pact.
{{200879108-0-80702:}}I left behind notes on my process at Dov-Vahl Shrine in Elsweyr. Hopefully they're still there, in a storage room behind the Dragonguard training quarters. \n\nAfter all, what better place to hide something from a Dragon? May the lens be your guide.
{{200879108-0-80703:}}But that's just it, this riddle is perfect for her mind. She loves puzzles, twisting things around in her head. What's twistier than a paradox? \n\nThat's it … I think. Go ask the dragon if you're Ulfsild's inheritor, and complete that trial!
{{200879108-0-78672:}}Dead? What a ghastly turn of events. Hold on, another memory is coming back to me. Yes. The cook always had a secret love for my mother. Was it grief that led him to kill himself? It must have been. You don't think he also killed mother?
{{200879108-0-80667:}}Just to warn you, there's no way the Dragon will accept Ulfsild's riddle as your own.\n\nBut I'm sure it would help to see the approach she took. Ulfsild left behind a number of notes, the Dragon's trial was one that truly challenged her.
{{200879108-0-79618:}}They're Bosmer who are obsessed with the notion that maybe we're all descended from Ayleids. What does it matter? The Green is what's important in the here and now.
{{200879108-0-81645:}}Truth is written by the victors, mercenary. Haven't you learned that by now? The only truth is what I disclose to my superiors. Everything else is simply rumor and conjecture.
{{200879108-0-78676:}}It had become one of my daily duties while Edric was away. I usually try to brew her a pot before I leave for the market. Apologies for not mentioning that earlier. My daily tasks have become innumerable.
{{200879108-0-81972:}}Well, if the Gryphon is the stout defender Ulfsild's notes make him out to be, you'd think he'd take a dim view to thievery.\n\nBut apparently this mighty gryphon and this clever fox got along as thick as … well. Thick as thieves.
{{200879108-0-81973:}}I think she felt there were more important things to write about. She seems very driven. In the echoes, in the notes. \n\nCompelled by her quest to understand Scribing and the Luminaries. To leave behind a legacy.
{{200879108-0-80320:}}No plan is ever certain, and we don't have time for maybes and what abouts! I didn't become a commander in the Imperial Legion by second guessing myself. And I won't be questioned by a hired mercenary.\n\nNow get to it!
{{200879108-0-80322:}}Tribune Alea will repair the ballista while you douse the barricade in oil. Once it's ready, launch a flaming bolt into the oil and set it ablaze. That should hold their advance and create a kill zone.\n\nAfter that, use the ballista at will.
{{200879108-0-80326:}}Oh. Yes, I do suppose I owe her for that. I'm no hired assassin, but I do make a habit out of disposing of dangerous vampires.\n\nWe will do what is necessary to end this threat. Nothing more, nothing less. And that begins with destroying the wine.
{{200879108-0-81976:}}Something about those names. Gray and Zariah. They seem familiar, but I can't imagine I've read this.\n\nMaybe the fable was the basis for one of my mom's many bedtime stories? She had scores of them, for every season and mood that took her.
{{200879108-0-80492:}}The only thing I can do. Run. I'm no coward and I don't want to be labeled a deserter, but what choice do I have? A captain's word carries more weight than a lowly Orc legionary's. A lot more.\n\nI wrote a report. Will you give it to the captain?
{{200879108-0-80490:}}Because he wants to lure the Goblins to his hunters. They won't be paid unless the Goblins are dead. And Jerntann is lazy enough to devise a plan to get the Goblins to come to him.\n\nI think Octavius let the hunters camp in Gray's Hollow.
{{200879108-0-80497:}}No clue at all. Her letter was quite short. All it said was she learned something in Ostumir. She said it was important and I needed to see it for myself.\n\nShe wants to share whatever she discovered with me. That's all I know.
{{200879108-0-80495:}}I'm not sure. They certainly spout rhetoric that matches many of her closely held beliefs. I thought those beliefs were simply musings, but the Recollection seeks to put them into deadly practice. \n\nBe sure, when next we meet, I plan to ask her why.
{{200879108-0-79913:}}Trust in Beragon's knowledge of the Recollection. There is an anomaly I wish to look into while you and he pursue the cultists and ferret out their plans. Perhaps the wildburn seed you found in Ostumir is the place to start.\n\nI shall find you later.
{{200879108-0-79916:}}Merian commands the troops stationed at Feldagard. He's stubborn, but has an excellent tactical mind. He'll know exactly how we can help once we get in there.
{{200879108-0-79914:}}Lord Valente's new wife. A High Elf with a name too complicated for this one's Khajiiti tongue.\n\nDro'vir believes they met during young Gallio's time away, but what does this old field hand know of such things?
{{200879108-0-81979:}}Did Beragon tell you that? No, ordinary greenspeaking can't manipulate something as large as this new forest, and certainly not as fast as it appeared. Beyond that, I'd rather not speculate. It goes against my training as a researcher.
{{200879108-0-79001:}}All necromancy is sacrilege to Arkay, but this particular ritual could endanger all of West Weald. The necromancers were attempting to resurrect an undead army. I shudder to think what they may have intended to use it for.
{{200879108-0-79000:}}When we followed Torvesard to Ithelia's prison, he was as surprised as we were. She had already escaped. Perhaps the act of restoring her memory to the world was enough for her to set herself free.\n\nNow Ithelia is loose and somewhere in West Weald.
{{200879108-0-79002:}}Arkay help me, I have worked with worse. Your necromantic insight could prove useful here—reprehensible as it is. But if I should perish, leave my body out of your unseemly practice. I would rather remain dead.
{{200879108-0-79005:}}Hmm, definitely part of an ancient Mirrormoor titan. It should serve nicely as the focal point of the ritual Leramil and I developed.\n\nAs soon as she collects herself, Leramil will guide you through the process.
{{200879108-0-79007:}}The Echonir was forgotten for centuries in the collection of a Daedric demiprince. Hermaeus Mora saw no need to reclaim it, until now. He arranged for the Echonir to come into my hands.\n\nI suspect I was always meant to give it to you.
{{200879108-0-79008:}}I am hardly an Ayleid scholar. I know they were called Wild Elves and they established Tamriel's first empire. Their city-states were spread across much of this region, but their empire fell during the First Era.\n\nMuch about them has been lost.
{{200879108-0-81525:}}The Imperial Legion protected the empire when there was still an empire to protect. With those three pretenders fighting over the Ruby Throne in Cyrodiil, the West Weald Legion primarily defends Skingrad and its vassals.\n\nI'm proud to serve.
{{200879108-0-81524:}}Count Calantius of Skingrad owns the estate. Uses it when he needs a break from the politics of his court. I think he lets visiting dignitaries stay here, too.\n\nAll I know for sure is that I was sent to meet the cohort here, but I can't find them.
{{200879108-0-78837:}}The injured will be moved somewhere safer once reinforcements arrive. Then we'll retake the hold. Once we're certain Leftwheal is safe, we'll work on repairs. You'd be surprised how many survivors are ready to start reconstruction.
{{200879108-0-78833:}}We thought Nantharion unleashed the wildburn to expand Dawnwood. It does that, of course, but the memory suggested another purpose. They want to wake up Ayleid magic and restore that ancient realm.\n\nAnd apparently, restore Ithelia in the process!
{{200879108-0-78832:}}Do? We kill Balandrus, just like I planned. He broke our pact and started consuming innocent people.\n\nWe robbed gold to pay blood servants to sustain us. We were thieves first, vampires second. Or so I thought. The curse was just a means to an end.
{{200879108-0-78831:}}Doesn't matter. This is still her fault. The Terror came to Sutch looking for her. When he couldn't find her, he set his gang loose and started stockpiling weapons around town. \n\nIf I didn't make a deal, my family would be dead now. Or worse.
{{200879108-0-78830:}}Why do you think? Balandrus is calling himself the Terror of the Weald now. He's trying to build a vampire army! And he's using the people of Sutch to swell his ranks!\n\nLook, whatever you may think of me, you can't leave me here to die. You can't!
{{200879108-0-78839:}}I'll admit that I was quite shaken by these events. I spent more time questioning my policies and mandates than actually putting in the work. You showed me that actions are more inspiring than words. A lesson I won't soon forget.
{{200879108-0-80256:}}I realized I just couldn't send strangers into a situation I was too scared to be in myself.\n\nI didn't get very far though. Stepping on that trap was stupid, but I'm glad I was here to identify the knife for you.
{{200879108-0-78898:}}Didn't I say I wasn't going to talk about that? Yes, I ran with Balandrus. Yes, I've done things I regret. And he put these marks in my neck when I was young and stupid.\n\nAll you need to know is Balandrus is dangerous and I plan to stop him.
{{200879108-0-79320:}}My father's office … my office now, I suppose. It's been unoccupied since he died. I know I need to go in there. Take stock of things. But … it's hard.\n\nIf you could see if anything related to our investigation stands out, I'd appreciate it.
{{200879108-0-80552:}}Most assuredly … hmm. Rite of Propagation. That would be in the far back corner, with our oldest documents. \n\nYou're welcome to take it. Just please be careful. That scroll may be one of only a handful left in the world.
{{200879108-0-79492:}}I know those two. They'd never be happy as outcasts. If they stay, there's always a chance we can sort this out.\n\nI still need to work on these supplies. Would you be willing to talk to some friends of the families? Get them to encourage patience?
{{200879108-0-79496:}}Hmm. Gundelion. He's Laeni's grove-father. Helped her walk for the first time. Ah, and Malaniel. Clendagal's tutor with a blade.\n\nBoth of them should be nearby. Thank you, traveler. There's a stiff brew with your name on it once we get this sorted.
{{200879108-0-80756:}}I wonder if Ulfsild ever faced a personal trial like this, when she met the Luminaries the first time. \n\nI guess we just have to do what we can, when we can, and hope for the best. Oh Magnus. Did the Netch teach us a lesson?
{{200879108-0-80750:}}Elic had such a love of history. I thought he'd relish the change to stand with the soldiers that made it. \n\nI wanted to fight side-by-side with my son, wanted that life so badly. Handing me his blade felt like he'd run it through my heart.
{{200879108-0-79336:}}Fort Colovia is a Legion training center, though our ranks aren't nearly as full as in the past. Still, who better to guard and deliver the count's invitations than raw recruits?\n\nPlease, destroy those crates before they deliver a single invitation.
{{200879108-0-78700:}}We really thought things were looking up. Lord Valente had such grand ideas for the vineyard and winery. He even asked us to try a new vintage he was working on. We felt so honored! Then we started to get sick and he locked us down here.
{{200879108-0-80519:}}That's a very personal question. I mean no offense, but I'm not inclined to share it with someone I only just met.\n\nPerhaps someday. I hope you understand.
{{200879108-0-80518:}}As much as I trust you and value your company, my friend, that's not a story I feel like sharing. Especially not … here and now.\n\nMaybe someday. I hope you understand.
{{200879108-0-80517:}}I'm not going to go out of my way to kill Gallio, if that's what you're asking. We do need to destroy his operation, though. This elixir-turned-wine is too dangerous to distribute to aggressive vampire clans. What happens after that is up to him.
{{200879108-0-80513:}}We were betrothed, a marriage arranged by our families. There might have been some affection there, but it was mostly a business agreement.\n\nWhen I became a vampire, I just left. I thought it would be a mercy.
{{200879108-0-80512:}}Right, right. We do need to figure out what's going on here.\n\nAll right, I'll stay and talk to Ursilia. You head into the manor and see if you can find Lord Valente's office. Something in there might tell us more about the purpose of this wine.
{{200879108-0-80511:}}That's a story for another time, friend. Let's stay focused. You see what you can find in the manor while I talk to Lady Valente.
{{200879108-0-81266:}}Yes. I was scouting atop the outer walls when the attacks began. It was like the air itself was charged with magicka. You could feel a great build up of magic and then great bursts of energy erupted across Leftwheal. The beasts came soon after.
{{200879108-0-81268:}}That remains a mystery for now. We know they aided Torvesard in his quest to remember what he had lost, and we know they are searching Ayleid ruins. Perhaps they continue to assist Torvesard or some other Daedra connected to Ithelia in some way.
{{200879108-0-78260:}}They certainly seemed to know what was in our wagon. But we closely guard all information regarding our aging process and routes to market. If we can learn how they knew to ambush us here, that would also help immensely.
{{200879108-0-80650:}}I am endlessly fascinated by the world inside the mind, the universe within. And what are riddles but a shift in perspective? \n\nEven the smallest question can lead to an entirely new worldview, if asked at the right time.
{{200879108-0-78267:}}Let me see that. Gilroy Vassinus? His family used to own a rival winery, but they went out of business years ago. Is that why he turned to banditry?\n\nAnd Ruri? He's worked with us for years. If he needed money, he could have just asked me.
{{200879108-0-82011:}}The Prince of Knowledge sent tentacles deep into the ground beneath Rootwater Grove. That'll let me wiggle my way into a part of Apocrypha called the Obscured Forum. \n\nHe has a little bit of creatia tucked away in there. Smells like … old books?
{{200879108-0-81737:}}Yes. She allowed me to briefly experience the possibilities of the Many Paths. Gadayn still exists somewhere … I think. If there is a chance ….\n\nHope is not something I usually put stock in, but Gadayn believed in faith. How could I do less?
{{200879108-0-81732:}}There is beauty to this countenance, is there not? And as I could have chosen anything when I was formed, why would I not be this magnificent creature?\n\nFrankly, I think it's embarrassing that the others chose such pedestrian shapes.
{{200879108-0-81733:}}I exist because of a confluence of magic beyond the bounds of mortal influence. I was not born from a magical accident, or a summoning gone awry. The ebb and flow of Aetherius and Nirn were my parents.\n\nA small riddle for you, then. Why was I born?
{{200879108-0-80655:}}Happy to. Hmm, Riddle of the Rich seems straightforward. You're looking for special treasures in the major settlements in Reaper's March? \n\nLucky for you, there are only three major settlements in the March! Rawl'kha, Arenthia, and Dune.
{{200879108-0-78269:}}He could have gotten us seriously hurt, killed even. And for what? Gold?\n\nI'll have to turn him in to the guards when we reach Skingrad. Then he'll spend some time in one of Count Calantius's dungeon cells.
{{200879108-0-80938:}}Oh. Right. Yes. So, I dropped it. \n\nI was down by the water taking a drink when a great large cat spooked me. I didn't think cats got that big! I think it's still down there.
{{200879108-0-80036:}}I sense potential. You hunger for power. Much as Ulfsild did when she sought me out all those years ago. I will ask you the same question I asked her.\n\nDo you deserve this power? The power to edit grimoires, to rewrite magic?
{{200879108-0-78821:}}Feldagard Keep is one of the largest fortresses in the Colovian Highlands. It's absolutely vital to the defense of West Weald. Tribune Alea went there after you found that report at Hoperoot.\n\nShe's concerned the Recollection plans an attack, friend.
{{200879108-0-78401:}}Oh, not very much. I've never been there myself. But if you've seen one Ayleid ruin you've seen them all, am I right?\n\nIt might be empty or falling apart. Or it could be full of bandits or undead or wild creatures. Anything is possible.
{{200879108-0-78409:}}Our arcanists call these creatures fractured remnants, though this one is definitely a more powerful version.\n\nMost fractured remnants would be easy prey for a squad of legionaries, but the Fate-Eater appears to be much more dangerous.
{{200879108-0-80089:}}Your knight has returned, with allies at her side. But that can wait.\n\nMortal, fable-bearer, friend. Accept my gift to you. The power of a Luminary of Magic.
{{200879108-0-80088:}}Until now, your mastery of the art was limited. With my support, your horizon expands.\n\nSo too, the vision of your allies. I will ensure their efforts to explore and chronicle the contents of the Scholarium meet with success.
{{200879108-0-80081:}}I'm not sure really. Signs of a struggle? Maybe a disturbance of some sort? It takes more than you think to get an entire camp this angry—let alone two. \n\nI'm familiar with this Bitterfish camp. I should be able to tell when something's amiss.
{{200879108-0-80083:}}What we'll be doing won't strictly be research. We'll be intervening for a good cause. \n\nThis time, we'll make our observations and inquiries from within the Goblin camps. Hopefully it doesn't interfere with my research's integrity.
{{200879108-0-80082:}}Same way you study anything else I guess. \n\nI keep my distance and observe the Goblins from afar. Sometimes they get comfortable enough with my presence that I can move closer. But I never disturb their lives or interfere with what they're doing.
{{200879108-0-80085:}}For a time it was a modest trading post connecting Skingrad merchants with Hammerfell. Now we broker trade with the Gold Coast and northern Dominion territories. Every transaction has helped Leftwheal grow into the trading center of Colovia.
{{200879108-0-80084:}}Now, as with Ulfsild before you, I offer you the Sigil of the Indrik. You will take it to the altar, and imbue my strength within. \n\nThe power I pass to you will infuse every drop of ink, every sheet of parchment. Each whorl and dot upon the page.
{{200879108-0-80087:}}More often than not? Lower taxes. As I said, every transaction is meant to benefit Leftwheal's citizens. But lately, they've wanted more freedom in what they can bring in for trade.\n\nIf I'd stood my ground, maybe none of this would have happened.
{{200879108-0-80086:}}As the trading post grew, the need for more stability rose. Eventually Leftwheal became a proper town and, with that, came the need for a baroness who tends to its citizens' needs while balancing the demands of the merchant lords.
{{200879108-0-79519:}}They're called the Recollection. I mentioned to them that the symbol of King Dynar, last of the Ayleid Kings, could be found here. I never expected that they would betray me! But you're going to help me, aren't you?
{{200879108-0-79518:}}I was exploring these Ayleid ruins, looking for the Emblem of the Last King, when my associates suddenly turned on me and threw me out!
{{200879108-0-79673:}}Ontus attracts workers from both the Highlands and Hammerfell. It's known for its prosperous ranch, and the quarry has made a fortune supplying Cyrodiil with stone to repair keeps on all sides of the war.\n\nAs a legionary, I'm not thrilled about that.
{{200879108-0-82048:}}If we find any more wildburn seeds, we will destroy them. As for the area of devastation, our greenspeakers shall attempt to repair the damage and restore the land. It will take time, but nature will heal.\n\nIt always does.
{{200879108-0-80708:}}I think it likely the Netch will reveal some sign to you. It delights in showing off its … cleverness.\n\nNahlia and I discovered an echo in the west wing that should relate to the Netch. I'm sure whatever you learn there will be most instructive.
{{200879108-0-80707:}}A prank, no doubt. The Netch is known for pranks and tricks. It enjoys wandering invisibly, causing mischief and spreading what it considers to be joy.\n\nThe Netch almost certainly traded out the Scholarium's fable for one of its authorship.
{{200879108-0-80704:}}Haha. I do. You have a mind for riddles. And even from all those years ago, it's clear Ulfsild wanted you to have my support.\n\nI find you worthy of my power. Take my sigil to the altar, inheritor. Or pretender. Whichever you are.
{{200879108-0-82047:}}I want to see if you have a mind for riddles. I've written a series that will whet your appetite for greater challenges to come.\n\nIf you can decipher all of them, well done. But you need only complete those which most appeal to you.
{{200879108-0-82046:}}From what we can tell, the staff is Ithelia's relic, filled with her power. Right now, since Ithelia doesn't seem to be exerting any power of her own, the Skein has focused on the staff. Lucky for us, Nantharion has that and we need to find him.
{{200879108-0-81331:}}Apparently a few months back, what was once rolling hills and rich Colovian farmland was suddenly engulfed by this great forest.\n\nLook, help me rescue more Ostumir survivors, then we can find Sorilen. I can toss you some coin for your efforts.
{{200879108-0-80658:}}Interesting. I wonder why she didn't recommend the same to Ulfsild.\n\nThe Riddle of the Moon. You may remember Do'Krin Monastery from the fable. A unique flower blooms there. I believe that's what you're meant to collect.
{{200879108-0-80654:}}Interesting! Not quite what I expected. The Riddle of the Hunt here sounds like she wants you to slay beasts and monsters in Reaper's March. \n\nIt's similar to the Riddle of Battle, except that's more specific.
{{200879108-0-79475:}}The legionary from Ontus who abandoned his post? It was rumored that he had deserted the Legion, but we weren't completely sure. Now we know.\n\nI hope this is a burden off Calvo's shoulders—provided he survives.
{{200879108-0-79477:}}Ridiculous! Clendagal belongs here. I want him to see the world from the top of the canopy, not the bottom of the forest floor. \n\nTo see the world as our King Nantharion sees it. Our king plans for the future, for our people. For Vashabar!
{{200879108-0-79472:}}Rabbit dung! Laeni will be our next greenspeaker. She'd never abandon her duty to the Green! Damn Minth and his Dawnway spawn. They're weeds in our garden! I won't allow this marriage. I'll make that clear to Laeni—as soon as I finish this jagga.
{{200879108-0-81071:}}Jealousy, I assume. They'd hardly be the first to tie me up because of my looks.
{{200879108-0-81133:}}Speak your vow of loyalty.
{{200879108-0-79688:}}Wonderful! Your opinion will pair nicely with a glass of wine.
{{200879108-0-81915:}}For you and I, friend? Not at all! You know we follow a strict code. We take no blood by force, help those in need, and do our best to curtail hostile vampires.\n\nAssist me in those efforts here, as you have in the past, and I shall be grateful.
{{200879108-0-81918:}}You did? That's one less problem I need to worry about then.\n\nAs for the invitation, when things make no sense, I feel obliged to find clarity. Dangerous vampires bidding on wine they cannot drink hints at a mystery I cannot leave unsolved.
{{200879108-0-81236:}}The Echonir causes memories pertaining to Ithelia to become visible as nebulous manifestations. When you discover one, simply hold forth the Echonir. The relic makes the memory unfold before your eyes.\n\nI foresee that you will need it, proxy.
{{200879108-0-81313:}}Greenspeaker Sorilen sent me a letter. Asked me to meet her here. After I arrived, the ground rumbled like an angry timber mammoth. Whole buildings collapsed, trapping people.\n\nWhen the new forest appeared, it damaged the village. This may end it.
{{200879108-0-81317:}}Bosmer who honor the Green wouldn't have anything to do with a wildburn seed, but I want to show the seed we recovered to a greenspeaker. If they can tell us more about it, it might lead us right to the Recollection.\n\nHelp me and I'll pay your way.
{{200879108-0-81387:}}This one supposes we would have died. Risk and reward are what fuels mortals in Oblivion.\n\nThat might be why Xoryn never succeeded in capturing the knot. He had less to risk than we did.
{{200879108-0-81386:}}Asked you to throw the arcane knot back into the Lucent Citadel and then thought of another plan. \n\nThis one knows how fraught our journey out of the citadel was, but there was time for us to come up with a different plan.
{{200879108-0-81380:}}I remember when the Legion didn't have to rely on mercenaries. Still, I'd appreciate the help. Until I find my cohort or the missing servants, I have to assume Skingrad's in danger. I can't abide that.\n\nAssist me and I'll see you well paid.
{{200879108-0-81382:}}This one isn't foolish enough to say that the scribes are without their faults. But, he spent enough time dedicated to their cause to know that the Scribes of Mora take anomalies and mysterious items seriously.
{{200879108-0-79081:}}I don't even know. How does one run an estate? I'll have to hire staff of course. Then get around to the gardens. It's been ages since I've done a proper pruning. Oh, it's all so much, isn't it?\n\nBut I'll have Betu. He'll keep me sane.
{{200879108-0-79083:}}I'll ensure that Otho and Betu are recognized as the estate owners. From there it's largely up to Otho. I'd imagine he'd want to hire staff and begin tending to the estate grounds again.\n\nAt the very least I'll make sure he rests.
{{200879108-0-79082:}}Course I do. Never had a pet or siblings. And I've been tending to rich folks' gardens ever since I could use a pair of shears. It wasn't until this estate that I felt like I could breathe. Be myself. Have friends.\n\nBetu's a part of that.
{{200879108-0-79085:}}It might sound strange, leaving an estate to a dog, but wealth can be funny like that. I once attended a masquerade in Summerset organized by a pet cat. Everything has paled in comparison since.\n\nBetu's a good boy. I'm sure he'll adjust.
{{200879108-0-79084:}}If I'd found out when I first arrived, I may have been a little more concerned, but after seeing the way Otho dotes on Betu? And knowing how much that dog meant to my aunt? I have no qualms.\n\nThis is what she wanted.
{{200879108-0-79087:}}Yes, and Mizzik could not have done it without you. But resting in the shade of one's successes too long dulls the claws. We will meet again, friend. And criminals will tremble at the thunder of our boots!\n\nMizzik likes saying that part.
{{200879108-0-79086:}}Mizzik will stay for a while as executor of the estate. But he cannot linger long. There are crimes that require his attention and he must hurry before the trail goes cold.
{{200879108-0-79685:}}Because Anuic and Padomaic forces simultaneously defy and support Molag Bal, he both simultaneously resists and submits to the will of others.\n\nThis then means Molag Bal is either not completely dominant, or is not completely real.
{{200879108-0-81836:}}Almost every innkeep apprenticeship I ever had kicked me out. They said my drink ideas were too complicated. Really hurt at the time.\n\nWhen I could afford to buy my own place, I named it after how I felt back then. Showed them, didn't I?
{{200879108-0-81055:}}Tread lightly. I hate to admit it, but I've never been good in a panic. Quite the opposite, actually. I doubt my fear will come willingly.\n\nI'll catch up with you as soon as I've settled, well, I suppose it's my tab now, isn't it?
{{200879108-0-81834:}}Can't think of a better word. They're not people, just sort of disturbingly people-shaped. I think they want to speak, but they don't make a sound.\n\nThey arrived and the sky cracked exactly when the woman by the fire stepped through the door.
{{200879108-0-80163:}}The Bitterfish and Sharp Tooth Goblins have well-documented totem motifs. Both will have skulls in a place of prominence. Bitterfish totems are taller and incorporate feathers while the Sharp Tooth totems are shorter and very clean.
{{200879108-0-81832:}}Not a one. But a good innkeep can guess what a customer needs, and she needs a drink. Something to wake her up—a Skyrim Sunrise.\n\nI can't leave my patrons with these shadows, though. Could you go to the well and fetch some water? You'll drink free.
{{200879108-0-79708:}}Yes. She was quite the sight. Covered in soot, a makeshift weapon in her hand. She knocked on every door to make sure no one was left behind. I only found myself trapped because I tried to mirror her bravery. I owe my life to the both of you.
{{200879108-0-79709:}}Perhaps you're right. Coin I can always make more of. Although, by the look of things, it will be a while before any coin is made here again.
{{200879108-0-79706:}}Yes. I am lucky. But my wife I apologize, I'm afraid I can't bear to talk about it.
{{200879108-0-79707:}}No. I must admit, I turned and fled as soon as one stood to approach me. I had counted on myself to do more in such dire circumstances, but I saved little more than my own scales.
{{200879108-0-79704:}}I was deep in a game of Tribute when the first walls came down. I swallowed the last of my mead and was out of there, a shame because I left behind all of my winnings.
{{200879108-0-79702:}}I was tending to my stall when I heard the noise. Like the sky cracking open and the rushing of water. When I came out to investigate the streets were filled with those horrible creatures.
{{200879108-0-79703:}}I don't. I've heard talk of the relics we imported being part of their plan, but they may only be panicked rumors. All I know for sure is that I wouldn't have survived if the baroness hadn't evacuated my quarter.
{{200879108-0-79700:}}Ard Caddach, ruler of the Reach. The diplomat bears his seal and speaks with his authority. The count would prefer to just return the trinkets and mollify the despot, thus avoiding escalating the situation.\n\nBesides, we have no need of the trinkets.
{{200879108-0-79701:}}Not much, I'm afraid. It was quite unexpected, a lovely sunny day suddenly covered with a crisp fog.
{{200879108-0-78315:}}That's a good question. Each handles a different series of missions for the Legion. Who do you wish to know more about?
{{200879108-0-80338:}}Fairly, though I wish I had made more of an effort to visit. I spent many summers here when I was younger, but school and then my position kept me away for far too long. She was kind, generous. Her loss outweighs any treasure we might find.
{{200879108-0-80199:}}Exactly. Abolisher, forged by Boethiah to cut a path to Ithelia wherever she walks. The Lamp of Clarity, created by Azura to illuminate the Many Paths. And the Skein of Secrets, woven by Mephala to show where Ithelia and the Unseen could be found.
{{200879108-0-80106:}}They both showed up in West Weald around the same time. Oh, I don't think every Wood Elf in Vashabar is a member of the Recollection, but some must be.\n\nIt doesn't help that they occupy a new forest that appeared on land that doesn't belong to them.
{{200879108-0-81665:}}There will be time to catch up after we help some people. We could kick back with some Sun's Dusk Ale and swap stories.\n\nWhat else did you want to know?
{{200879108-0-82014:}}Dark and full of shadows. Scary things around every corner, it seems like. It's all the worst parts of a Witches Festival party wrapped up in one place.\n\nWhen we get there I'll stick close to the entrance. You try not to get caught!
{{200879108-0-82017:}}Shardmarshal Vargas? I am not familiar with that Daedric rank. We know they assisted Torvesard in his quest to remember the Forgotten Prince. Perhaps this Vargas is also connected to Ithelia.\n\nNo matter. It is evident we have more to learn, proxy.
{{200879108-0-82010:}}Do you like books? Because if you do, Apocrypha is the place for you! Books as far as the eye can see!\n\nLet's just hope we can keep a low profile over there. Hermaeus Mora has so many eyes!
{{200879108-0-82013:}}Bad guys that follow Dagon burned the town of Dawnbreak, thinning the barrier between Auridon and the Deadlands. \n\nWe'll slip through to this fortress called Ardent Hope. The creatia the Prince has stashed there … oof. Smells burny! Like sulfur!
{{200879108-0-78385:}}With no shortage of tasks and workers at a premium, Count Calantius assigned the task of preparing invitations for his upcoming gala to me. Busy as I am, well, I may not have paid close enough attention to the printer I hired.
{{200879108-0-78384:}}So you were listening. Good!\n\nThe field hand described Gallio as different when he returned. He developed a new grape to make him richer and more powerful. And he recently married a High Elf, but the marriage already seems troubled.
{{200879108-0-78386:}}When the printer sent me the invoice, a printed invitation was included. That's when I noticed the … errors.\n\nNow the invitations refer to that feeble-minded count instead of fastidious, and call Skingrad ineffective instead of influential.
{{200879108-0-78381:}}A wonderful idea from dear Aquilia! This one fears there is more afoot to Lady Weatherleah's death, but our first clue is currently in the jowls of a dog—a hairy, stinky thing. Betu is the beast's name, though this one calls him headache.
{{200879108-0-78383:}}Yes, yes. Aquilia wishes the question of inheritance be conclusively answered before it becomes fodder for the gossips. Now, dear aide, we must find Betu. This one has already found his tracks.\n\nLet us crouch down and follow his trail.
{{200879108-0-81385:}}I—I'm not sure. I was hurt by debris. Then I just started walking. I stopped here to rest. Then you stopped by.\n\nOstumir truly belongs to this jungle now. But maybe you can help any survivors. You and that nice Beragon.
{{200879108-0-81384:}}No. The forest sprang up months ago. Some of us decided to return, try to reclaim our village from this unnatural jungle. It was going well, too. Then the ground started to shake and what was left of Ostumir started falling down around us.
{{200879108-0-81771:}}Not yet. First, I volunteered to replace him as constable. Then I had to make the arrangements to bury him. \n\nWith multiple deaths to investigate, I need to hire a deputy. So, what do you say, traveler. Interested in the job?
{{200879108-0-81776:}}Precious little, I'm afraid. They broke though an old wall to get at it.\n\nVotary Nahlia can fill you in on the details, but I heard one of the other knights mention it's old, deep magic. Makes sense, given the age of Sunnamere.
{{200879108-0-81777:}}No, Sunnamere predates the founding of the Mages Guild by oh, a thousand years or so?\n\nIt's an ancient library, I think, lots of dusty tomes and some esoteric stories from all across Tamriel.
{{200879108-0-81778:}}Well, rumor is that Archmagister Vanus formed the order to lend legitimacy to the Mages Guild, back when it was founded. That's not really a problem anymore.\n\nThe knights are brave, skilled, and true. But the order doesn't have much clout these days.
{{200879108-0-81779:}}Don't let Nahlia hear you say that. But yes, \nVotaries of the Order of the Lamp are a rare sight in Tamriel these days. \n\nAnd likely to get rarer as the years roll on.
{{200879108-0-80829:}}People in distant lands like to focus on our eating habits. Or what we think about fallen trees.\n\nThe truth is the Green Pact is a way of inviting the forest into our lives. Into our hearts. And that just makes me so happy.
{{200879108-0-80823:}}The point to which we must travel to follow Ithelia, I assume. Perhaps we will find a portal to her realm there. Or mayhap there is something we are meant to learn in Wendir. We must trust the Skein.\n\nI shall meet you there, proxy.
{{200879108-0-79168:}}The storm in my head, remember? I cannot focus through all the overlapping Paths. I think this damned lamp was used against me, but I cannot understand how.\n\nCould you pick it up? I wish to examine it but could not stand holding the horrid thing.
{{200879108-0-79167:}}A phrase emerges from the storm. Sage's Dream. Yes, that's it. A drink, I think. It tastes of belonging. Cohesion.\n\nThe innkeeper. Ask him to make this drink for me. Quickly, before the storm takes me again.
{{200879108-0-79164:}}My name is … Ithelia. I am what mortals call a … Daedric Prince. My power, I feel myself losing control. These echoes. I summoned them but I did not mean to.\n\nThe inn … it drew me here. Called to me. I need something it can provide.
{{200879108-0-79165:}}I am Ithelia, the Daedric Prince of Paths, the Mistress of the Untraveled Road! I am … confused.\n\nSometimes an event surges into memory. Fear, anger, and resignation erupt all at once. Then I lose my grasp and forget again.
{{200879108-0-79163:}}I need to think about it. Maybe frost mirriam? Oh, some lotus might work ….\n\nIn the meantime, I need to make some syrup. Go to the cellar and grab some sugar. I'll keep thinking about this until you get back.
{{200879108-0-79160:}}An Ayleid drink? Odd. This inn was built on Ayleid ruins. Eh, just a coincidence.\n\nTirum weed, harkfruit juice, lute berries? I've never even heard of these ingredients. I can mimic that flavor profile, though. Just need some substitutions.
{{200879108-0-82080:}}So the town leaders would have everyone believe. My father made no mention of feeling unwell in his last letter. It was dated the same day he died. He often wrote to me about his investigations. Said it helped him think through all the permutations.
{{200879108-0-78811:}}It depends if we want to announce our arrival or stay hidden. The gate to the east is heavily defended. But there are fewer sentries at the west entrance. I think we could slip by them.\n\nOr we could try the path to the north.
{{200879108-0-78813:}}That's a good question. Sometimes natural fissures or caves provide hidden entrances to buried ruins. I saw no Recollection forces in that direction, so it might be worth investigating.\n \nYour call, friend. I'll follow your lead.
{{200879108-0-78814:}}Great welkynd stones like this one powered mighty enchantments. They could make buildings float in mid-air. Maintain networks of magical portals. Or seal impassable gates.\n\nI think this is exactly what we're looking for.
{{200879108-0-78817:}}A good point. And now we have the three relics they used to defeat the Prince of Paths. The question is where and how to use them. We know what Abolisher and the Lamp of Clarity do. \n\nBut we have no idea how to use the Skein.
{{200879108-0-79967:}}You should be able to follow those annotations in sequence, leading you from location to location. \n\nJust like the hunter in the fable, you seek the Indrik now. Let Ulfsild be your guide.
{{200879108-0-80162:}}Take it to Skingrad for study. Azura's Lamp was designed to hunt down Ithelia and her minions. Knowing how best to utilize it must be my next priority.\n\nPlease find me there when you are able. The chosen of fate still has much to do.
{{200879108-0-80251:}}She's right, it doesn't. This is my family's kitchen knife. My uncle said it was missing just the other day, but Goblins don't steal knives.
{{200879108-0-80787:}}I told him he would be a failure. That he'd come crawling back. \n\nWhat loving father does that? Divines, what possessed me to say such things?
{{200879108-0-80784:}}If I only knew! I was at the head of the patrol, about to lead the Daedra away to give my legionaries a chance, when Ulrath cut me down!\n\nThat Orc was always complaining, but to disobey a direct order? Probably upset I never gave him that promotion.
{{200879108-0-80785:}}That I had to live for my son. I feared I'd never live to meet him. I was just glad I wouldn't die alone.\n\nBut when I woke later, no one was there. And when next I saw my wife, she handed me our child. A boy. My Elic. Where is he?
{{200879108-0-80782:}}Yes. Any other time I'd be annoyed. Portals are all the guild thinks I'm good for. But this is important. \n\nI'll remain here, divine where you're headed next, and open pathways as you go. It gave me some kind of mystical ink that will help us out.
{{200879108-0-80780:}}You must be aware of the strange Daedra popping up all over West Weald. While the Legion is stretched thin, we're not helpless. My soldiers were patrolling this region when the very Daedra we were tracking turned the table on us!
{{200879108-0-80781:}}That's what the Netch said, something about the ink snarling my tendrils with the wayward soul fragments. \n\nThis is why I didn't stay with spellwork. If you're ready, wish me luck and let's get started.
{{200879108-0-78774:}}Defeat …? That word … friend, what sort of prank are you up to? I do remember the titan, though. And all our perilous adventures here in the Weald and beyond. What stories I'm going to have to tell my sister!
{{200879108-0-78775:}}Remember … forgotten … now you've really confused me, friend!\n\nWe can sort all of this out later. Curate Gadayn wants to talk to you. But try not to confound him, too. He's had a rough day.
{{200879108-0-79828:}}Then, I hope you succeed where I have failed. I tried to get my Prince to calm down, but she lashed out at Mora's forces with her full fury. The more she fought, the more lost she became.\n\nPerhaps there is still a chance for you. How can I help?
{{200879108-0-79826:}}My Shardborn should gut you. Whether you intend it or not, this humiliates me even more. An item of my ruin borne by a reflection who walks free.\n\nIf it will get you to leave, I have harkfruit, one of the ingredients for Sage's Dream. Take it and go.
{{200879108-0-79824:}}Of course she lost control of her powers. All Ithelias are fragile creatures. They break under the slightest pressure. Just like glass.\n\nHow did you get here if my reflection cannot control her power? How did you walk the Many Paths?
{{200879108-0-79822:}}The One Who Knows asked the demiprince Fa-Nuit-Hen to convey the Echonir to me after the cultists of the Blind Path made the mistake of invading his realm. Hermaeus Mora told me you would need it.
{{200879108-0-82124:}}He may not have any choice. It's not like the cure is easy to come by. I got lucky.\n\nAnyway, I'll do whatever I can to help Tham. Even take care of things if he winds up losing control. I pray it never comes to that, but he understands my position.
{{200879108-0-82123:}}The Scribing rite flashed the Archmage's mind upon the gathered power. And so I am her, from that moment.\n\nI went from woman to Crow, and had precious little time to speak with myself before the Scholarium was torn away.
{{200879108-0-81451:}}A vain, jovial, and generous being. It approaches life's solemn moments as an opportunity for new ways to demonstrate its wit and whimsy. \n\nThe Netch and Ulfsild got along famously well, but I find it to be a little … much.
{{200879108-0-81450:}}Lord Valente developed the new seeds in his alchemical laboratory under the manor. They grow thorny vines that bear a crimson grape unlike anything Dro'vir has ever seen before. Once the first vintage was ready, Lord Valente set up this auction.
{{200879108-0-81457:}}Very. And this new forest, it's like Valenwood jumped the river and spread here.\n\nI remember when Ostumir was founded. Some Wood Elves thought it was a prelude to invasion. But a fishing settlement posed no threats and cooler heads prevailed.
{{200879108-0-81458:}}That's one of the things I'm looking into. Something caused this forest to grow rapidly, so I suspect some sort of magic was involved. From the growth pattern, I'd guess that this stretch of land along the river was where the new growth originated.
{{200879108-0-80429:}}Not at first. We came back to West Weald thinking we'd be mercenaries. But Moricar's orders made it hard. We got hungry. And there were easy pickings on the Gold Road, day in and day out.\n\nThat fed us. Then we got greedy.
{{200879108-0-80422:}}I helped him on one of his attempts to obtain the arcane knot a long time ago. We never found where it was being kept and he blamed me. But guess who was navigating? Xoryn.\n\nLet's just say that I can't stand his personality.
{{200879108-0-80421:}}The object of this expedition. I'm not too interested in the arcane knot specifically, but Xoryn won't stop until he's got his dirty claws on it.\n\nI'm sure the knot is the only thing he thinks about, the idiotic fool.
{{200879108-0-80420:}}I tested the null arca against my own relics, but tests do not convince Fargrave's elite. And I refuse to sell unverified merchandise. \n\nInside the citadel is the most unstable object I know of. If the arca contains it, then it's a success.
{{200879108-0-80427:}}I don't relish telling that particular story. But I suppose you deserve to know. It's not like the people of Skingrad are about to forget it.\n\nThe Scarlets were a squad in the Imperial Legion. Irregulars for scouting and odd work.
{{200879108-0-80426:}}Back wallowing in the dirt, just like the old days. He's prospecting down south of the city, at some played-out mine. Seems Naku isn't quite so sure the place is done. Always was an optimist.\n\nAnyway, we need him here.
{{200879108-0-80424:}}Aye. Naku, the squad's sapper. He was a hard one to track down, so I focused on him while you were out bringing these three to roost.\n\nIt was pure luck I found him at all. Overheard a drunk prospector at the tavern yell his name.
{{200879108-0-81462:}}Questions are all well and good, but we have people to save!\n\nAnything else you want to know? Otherwise, let's get on with the rescuing, friend.
{{200879108-0-78308:}}Indeed. Apparently, the workers in this camp discovered an ancient shrine to Azura before they were overwhelmed. Leramil suggests that if you hold the Lamp of Clarity close to the shrine, Azura herself will restore its energy.
{{200879108-0-80259:}}There was a rough few seasons. Two camps lost their shamans to sickness while flooding destroyed their totems. Neither tribe left the battle with enough Goblins to support their camps. \n\nThe only thing Jerntann introduced to the tale is a knife.
{{200879108-0-81310:}}I … I have no idea. I'm not even sure why I seem to be a full vampire while the rest of the townsfolk were turned into bloodfiends. I guess that's just another thing I need to talk to Maerenah about. She's got more experience with this than I do.
{{200879108-0-81118:}}Maybe it was the sealing ritual, something she left behind to protect the Scholarium. She described it as a piece of herself?\n\nWait. The echoes. Look!
{{200879108-0-81117:}}So far they're just reinforcing what we already knew. Ulfsild sealed away the Scholarium to protect it from Sheogorath. Kind of lovely actually, the way she said it was for the Luminaries.\n\nAnd there was that bit about a ritual. Did you catch that?
{{200879108-0-81110:}}I sense a huge force of Shardborn ahead. And in my previous visits, I never saw anything like those crystalline growths. I think Ithelia reshaped this part of Fargrave when she came this way.\n\nI wonder, was this her destination or a means to an end?
{{200879108-0-81311:}}Another good question to which I have no answer. I love this town, but with most of the people gone, can Sutch even survive? \n\nI suppose one of the first things I need to do is check on my tavern. See how much of my livelihood remains intact.
{{200879108-0-80923:}}I imagine you could make a real difference against these Daedric monsters. But we can win a lot of battles and still lose the war. These incursions are going to keep coming until we stop them at their source. We need to deal with Shardmarshal Vargas.
{{200879108-0-80920:}}I have my own contacts. Old habits die hard, I suppose. But these came from Legion scouts reporting to Tribune Alea. They send word that Mirrormoor monsters are still appearing out of thin air all across the Weald.
{{200879108-0-80921:}}No, this is something that you and Leramil need to do together. You're fate's chosen and she's a magic-user who can see the threads of fate. I'm just a Watchling with delusions of grandeur and a bad attitude.\n\nLeramil will help you. She has to.
{{200879108-0-79429:}}All right, let me begin.
{{200879108-0-79423:}}So Lady Sowerra has been trained to walk in elegant circles around Sir Klauser and me. The question is, should she start in the front or in the rear?
{{200879108-0-81948:}}That does seem to be the general idea. If we allow this to spread, the ramifications will be staggering! Even relatively peaceful vampires might be tempted to start killing out of hand. We need to stop this.\n\nUm, what were you and Ursilia discussing?
{{200879108-0-81943:}}When she drinks Sage's Dream, she takes in the combined essences of her reflections. She gains their understanding of her power. Your Ithelia will reconnect to the Many Paths and regain control of her power.
{{200879108-0-81942:}}The Many Paths connects all Ithelias across all realities. This bond can weaken over time, causing distress to an Ithelia. We developed a means to reintegrate called Sage's Dream.\n\nIt manifests as a drink to consume, but this is only an illusion.
{{200879108-0-81941:}}I am as curious as you. Perhaps it does not aid you, but only appears to. Azura's essence may have a purpose of its own and you are only along to see that purpose fulfilled.\n\nI hope you find your answer as you continue your journey.
{{200879108-0-81940:}}Once Hermaeus Mora chose my fate, he recruited other Daedric Princes to aid in my capture. Azura answered his call by creating the Lamp of Clarity.\n\nIts light exposes my location on a path. Or, as you have seen, reveals doorways to the Many Paths.
{{200879108-0-81947:}}She is correct. I should not trust Azura's Lamp. But it led us to two ingredients needed for a Sage's Dream and now we have tirum weed and harkfruit. One more and we can make the drink. And then I can regain control of my powers.
{{200879108-0-81946:}}Most mortals quake in fear at my presence or demand one boon or another. But all you seek is knowledge? Interesting.\n\nAsk your questions then, pathwalker.
{{200879108-0-81945:}}An extended separation from the Many Paths, perhaps. Or yes, I see it now. Your Ithelia already suffered Mora's punishment. Her power was stripped from her when she was locked away.\n\nShe needs to calm the storm as her power seeks to return to her.
{{200879108-0-81944:}}The ingredients grow in an Ithelia's shadow. They form from our essence. We each produce only one ingredient.\n\nMixing these ingredients melds the essences from many Ithelias. When imbibed, we take in the power of our reflections.
{{200879108-0-78731:}}For now I'll focus on tending to the injured. But, with the rituals dealt with and reinforcements on the way, we'll soon gain the upper hand.\n\n It will be a while before we're trading again, but that can wait. I have my people to focus on.
{{200879108-0-81042:}}I will. You have upheld justice, acted as a protector, and been a boon companion to my dearest friend.\n\nYou've earned this, and then some. You may add my power to the Scribing Altar.
{{200879108-0-81664:}}Continued to investigate the Recollection. Nothing new to report. I hoped that Sorilen would help my efforts. She's smart and would make a good partner. Doing research, I mean.\n\nUntil I learn more, tracking this odd cult will take up my attention.
{{200879108-0-81661:}}I've tried to stay retired from adventuring. But recent events just pulled me back in. Something about the Recollection makes my ears burn. That happens when I sense danger.\n\nEventually I'll go back to my scribe duties. Until the next adventure.
{{200879108-0-80292:}}Planting seeds to wake the power that sleeps in the Darkened Home. I thought Nantharion wanted to cover West Weald in a great forest. But maybe the wildburn is just the collateral damage of his real purpose.
{{200879108-0-80071:}}I suggested we hide in the Ichor Sea until this blows over, but the Great Eye said no. So I need you and Leramil to accompany me to the instability.\n\nWill you serve as fate's chosen once more? I'll give you those pieces of gold you like so much.
{{200879108-0-80072:}}I granted my power to a being that did not ask for it and did not know how to use it. The height of arrogance. A vice I have been accused of on occasion. \n\nUse the lens, find their trail. And release these poor souls from my power without focus.
{{200879108-0-80075:}}This vineyard could be a mother lode in the right hands. My hands, friend of Fennorian, not my husband's.\n\nI assume you're here to stop him? Help Fennorian finish the task and I'll forgive him for the affront he visited upon me and my family.
{{200879108-0-80155:}}I think I'd have to. If we can resolve this peacefully, then others may need to know how we did it.\n\nGoblins are reasonable creatures, even in this state. If I return the totems, that might end this whole ordeal. Would you mind retrieving them?
{{200879108-0-82154:}}Not hardly! She led her soldiers into a slaughter and then ordered them to cover her retreat. I cut her down, then rallied the squad and headed for this keep. We fought a running battle. I'm all that's left.\n\nNow it's my word against an officer's.
{{200879108-0-82152:}}A question I had not considered. But the paths I saw were possibilities, not other realities. I asked Mora to return my Gadayn. I must believe that he did as I requested.\n\nIn the end, does it really matter? Gadayn has returned and I am relieved.
{{200879108-0-81592:}}I don't know. Last I heard she was part of the Wood Elf settlement in Vashabar. That isn't too far from here.
{{200879108-0-80747:}}I grew up thinking nothing could kill my father. He was a soldier, and later a mercenary. Tough as they come.\n\nSo when he wrote to me about this illness, I knew it was serious. We haven't spoken in years.
{{200879108-0-80748:}}That sounds like the Netch. Apparently you're not the only one being tested here.\n\nElic's father, Jahones, is still alive. But his soul is splintered and drifting across the face of Nirn.
{{200879108-0-80948:}}The other Luminaries concern themselves with challenges, riddles. Frippery and dalliance. \n\nIf you wish to earn my trust, my strength, know it takes heart to protect. To shield those that do not have the strength to defend themselves.
{{200879108-0-81091:}}I convinced Count Calantius and Greenspeaker Darolith to sit down and talk. They're finally ready to discuss stabilizing relations between Skingrad and Vashabar. I offered my home as a private venue for their meeting.\n\nThey also want to speak to you.
{{200879108-0-81093:}}Don't look so surprised, you're a hero!! You brought down Nantharion and defeated Shardmarshal Vargas. Yes, there are Recollection and Shardborn stragglers to deal with, but you earned the trust of both Wood Elves and Colovians through your actions.
{{200879108-0-81092:}}They're waiting for you out in the hall. I don't know what exactly they want to talk about, but it probably wouldn't hurt to remind them that friends make better neighbors than enemies.
{{200879108-0-81097:}}You know, it's funny. Not very long ago, I would have told you all I wanted was to deal with the threat of the Recollection and then retire from adventuring again. Go back to my books and scrolls. Enjoy the peace and quiet.
{{200879108-0-81096:}}Perhaps, but only if we can find a point of connection in this plane. Shardmarshal Vargas must have hurled our allies through physical distance as well as beyond this reality.
{{200879108-0-81099:}}Does that mean Ithelia's servants are finished in West Weald? I keep thinking about my sojourn in the Many Paths. Is that what's waiting for us if Ithelia begins changing things? Is that what the Scruut thing means by we're all doomed?
{{200879108-0-81098:}}Oh, there are Recollection holdouts and Daedric invaders from Mirrormoor to mop up. But I plan to devote myself to a harder task. Teaching a lot of stubborn Colovians to see the Wood Elves of Vashabar as neighbors instead of enemies.
{{200879108-0-78943:}}It had to be some sort of enemy army, but all I ever saw were a few Wood Elves sneaking around the grounds. We need to let everyone in the catacombs know it's safe to come out. Can you go retrieve the key and take care of that?
{{200879108-0-78941:}}Dead? Damn shame. He was tolerable, as far as Legion officers go. He had a good plan, too. While he hid everyone who was left in the catacombs, I was to keep watch until help arrived. I even stashed the key in a safe place in case the enemy found me.
{{200879108-0-78940:}}Groundskeeper Gaius is a tough old hedge snipper. We need to find him and get his key to open the catacombs. Then we can see how much of the cohort and household staff survived whatever happened here.\n\nLet's check Gaius's home first.
{{200879108-0-81502:}}So the planned attack on Feldagard Keep was with Daedric forces, not the Recollection? A good thing you were there to help Tribune Alea defend the fortress. And that blade you acquired. Any sword with a name must be important!
{{200879108-0-81500:}}I really do! Look, I know you can handle yourself even without a Knight of the Lamp. I'll focus on research and support.\n\nBut this trial is fascinating. And if I can be of service then, well. That's why I took up with the Order in the first place.
{{200879108-0-80008:}}If we were still on patrol, I'd be perfectly comfortable with Llaren and Julian at my side. But we have no idea what's beyond that portal. \n\nOne of the nice parts of being in a guild is you can call in backup. That's you.
{{200879108-0-78911:}}Our relationship started out well enough. A band of outlaws, trying to raise thievery to an art form. Whatever he did, Balandrus wanted to be the best. Later, when banditry turned to blood, we hit a dry patch.\n\nThat's when Balandrus began to change.
{{200879108-0-78317:}}<<1>> offers work that requires teams of mercenaries to dispatch threats. Normally we'd send legionaries to deal with such situations, but we just don't have the forces to spare.\n\nBe sure to bring allies to complete the job, but the pay is good.
{{200879108-0-78314:}}I've been part of the Imperial Legion since I was old enough to enlist. They keep trying to promote me, but I prefer just being part of the rank and file. That's where the action is!\n\nAnyway, talk to any of my colleagues if you need the work.
{{200879108-0-80351:}}The Scarlets had a rule: Take from those who can spare some. Take nothing from any that can't be undone.\n\nHard times never seemed to touch the fortunes of the rich. Still the same today, I reckon.
{{200879108-0-80353:}}The Eight watch over us! After all this time, Scarlets murdered?\n\nOf course, I'll meet with Hooke. But I can't leave yet. I'm stuck here until my quarry shows his head.
{{200879108-0-78639:}}Mora imprisoned her and made everyone forget. She posed a danger to all reality. Her scion, Torvesard, restored the memory of her to the world and she escaped from her prison.\n\nNow the Prince of Paths is loose and somewhere in West Weald.
{{200879108-0-78638:}}Wildburn? Like the area of devastation between the new forest and the rest of the Weald? A seed caused that? I had no idea. Nor did I guess the Recollection was involved. Is this new Dawnwood part of their plan?\n\nAn important discovery, proxy.
{{200879108-0-79948:}}As far as I can tell, the Recollection didn't even exist a year ago. It's like hundreds of people woke up one day and decided to join a new cult. They're convinced something has been taken from them. Something they'll do anything to reclaim.
{{200879108-0-79949:}}Plundering ancient ruins. Recruiting other people who feel lost. Mostly Wood Elves, but not exclusively. Whatever it is the Recollection thinks they're missing, it's made them desperate. And dangerous. And we know they're working with Daedra, too.
{{200879108-0-79947:}}My best guess is that the Recollection is a revival of an ancient Ayleid cult. The Ayleids didn't just vanish when their empire fell. Many found shelter in the surrounding lands. Some Wood Elves believe they're descendants of that heritage.
{{200879108-0-79197:}}To alert nearby Legion forces that Varen's Watch is in trouble and needs assistance. It's the fastest way to communicate across long distances.
{{200879108-0-79196:}}Hold her until reinforcements arrive. Then turn her over to soldiers who can take her back to Legion Command. She can tell us valuable information about the Recollection and their plans—with the proper motivation.
{{200879108-0-81734:}}Neither do I. That's why the mind fascinates me, mortal. It exists without purpose, but is beautiful in its complexity. \n\nAnd a riddle is a rock thrown into the pool of your contemplations. How could I not find that … endlessly fascinating?
{{200879108-0-80349:}}We were pressed into joining Emperor Moricar's invasion of Western Skyrim. A damn foolish thing—no surprise he's not here anymore. We barely survived. And when we finally straggled home, there was nothing left for us.
{{200879108-0-81122:}}Yes, I have been thinking about that. I believe Ithelia drew a massive amount of energy from the Many Paths to power the Loom. When you destroyed it, that energy flowed into Ithelia. All that power, it changed her. She seemed more enraged at the end.
{{200879108-0-81532:}}The Legion thrives on order. Hierarchy. That's what keeps it functioning among the chaos. Tribune Alea practices a looser approach on the battlefield.\n\nNever mind. It's inappropriate for me to criticize my tribune. To a stranger, no less.
{{200879108-0-79359:}}Since my soldiers are up to their ears in Daedra, you're going to slow down the assault.\n\nGo around the keep and reset some traps that we planted. As you do that, burn the ropes those Daedra are using to climb over the walls.
{{200879108-0-79352:}}Living quarters. The barracks extend beneath the keep, and a dungeon is below that. I'm not sure how the Daedra could get in down there, but we should take a look.\n\nThere's one more curious thing about this assault—where's the Daedric commander?
{{200879108-0-79355:}}This attack is much too coordinated to not have a leader. Find the commander and maybe we can sever the head of this army.\n\nLet's search the barracks for another breach. And keep watch for any Daedra that looks to be in charge.
{{200879108-0-79357:}}They're Daedra. They look funny, smell weird, and don't give a damn about dying. Call themselves Shardborn, but otherwise haven't made any demands.\n\nThey want my keep. I'll bring every stone here down upon their heads before I let that happen.
{{200879108-0-81534:}}Oh … that was you? You rained down fire on those Daedric beasts alongside her? Praise the Eight.\n\nShe spoke so highly of you. I'll admit I felt a bit jealous. Fortunately the battle ended in victory.
{{200879108-0-82005:}}All right mister big tough adventurer. I know for you going to a Daedric realm is like going to a corner bakery to buy some bread.\n\nBut the places we'll be going are being watched. We have to be … subtle. And subtle is my middle name!
{{200879108-0-81277:}}My Hytia … she was a gentle spirit. But all that was gentle in this house died that night, stranger. Burned to the bone, all her hopes and dreams turned to ash. Our son as well!\n\nI've waited for this moment. You can't take it from me!
{{200879108-0-80677:}}Let's see. Ulfsild made a riddle that started a fight among the Luminaries. Then she took cues from the Mizbi fable, and tried to craft an impossible paradox. \n\nA paradox. Wait, could it be that simple?
{{200879108-0-81781:}}I know she allowed me to briefly see the world the way she does. To gaze upon the Many Paths. For just a moment, I saw a path where Gadayn still existed. It gave me … hope.\n\nAs for what I do with that … I am at a loss.
{{200879108-0-81272:}}Eliana? She's a raging fire that one. Bright, powerful, unafraid to take up space. She made Leftwheal into the trading hub it is today. Without her we'd still be a handful of caravans stuck in the mud. If anyone could face this storm it's her.
{{200879108-0-81258:}}A stonemason primarily. I helped build this city. I've lost count of the number of bricks I've laid. If the baroness wants to rebuild she can count on my help.
{{200879108-0-81253:}}Ithelia is the Fate-Changer, the Unweaver. She has power unlike any other Daedric Prince—the power to shift existence itself.\n\nMora long suspected that Ithelia was dangerous. But full of uncontrollable rage? Reality itself unravels around her.
{{200879108-0-81256:}}Beragon told me that the group was initially formed to seek out something missing in their lives. It seems clear now they were looking for Ithelia, even if they did not know it. Now that Ithelia is free, their actions are becoming more conspicuous.
{{200879108-0-81255:}}From what I have determined, they are a secret society with a keen interest in ancient ruins. The revival of an Ayleid cult, perhaps.\n\nOur ally Beragon knows more. He recently tracked them to West Weald and has been looking into their activities.
{{200879108-0-81279:}}No … no, no, no! After all these miserable years, this waiting! I only lived for this moment! Can you even begin to understand that?\n\nI'll kill you. You and the Scarlets—starting with her!
{{200879108-0-81606:}}Hah, of course! Greenspeaking is a beautiful art, an extension of the deepest mysteries in Y'ffre worship. \n\nSome mages use it like you'd wield a hammer, as a tool. In our clan, we dedicate ourselves fully to hearing the Singer, to weaving the trees.
{{200879108-0-81547:}}No. Maybe. A little. But she's my commander and I follow orders.\n\nThe tribune's at Beragon's townhouse. Guess she decided the Wood Elf needed closer supervision. She's asking questions and making suggestions. Not sure he appreciates it either.
{{200879108-0-81608:}}Oh haha, no. Not everyone has the aptitude for magic. Or perhaps, like a songbird in the highest branch, the Storyteller's tune is too faint to hear. \n\nBut for those with the gift, we celebrate it in a way few still do in Valenwood.
{{200879108-0-80915:}}No. That cannot be. He had my amulet. And you were there. And Beragon. And Tribune Alea. There must be some mistake.\n\n\nGadayn—he cannot be gone.
{{200879108-0-80825:}}A bit of a pompous term for someone that's good at fighting with a sword, isn't it? I heard it from a High Elf in mixed training at a Dominion base. \n\nI kind of liked it. So I made it my own.
{{200879108-0-80743:}}If you decide to head into either the Forgotten Wastes or that … other place that I will not attempt to pronounce, be on your guard. The creatures that roam there are more powerful than most. You may do well to bring a companion with you.
{{200879108-0-81544:}}Well, me, I need to report in. Tell the head of my Order what's happened and get guidance from the Archmagister. \n\nIf you're asking my advice, why not stay here? Talk more with the Crow and see if you can start to walk this path she mentioned.
{{200879108-0-82089:}}We talked all the time. As I said, we were friends. He'd sometimes inquire if there was any chatter in the Stonechip he needed to worry about.\n\nBut the only news I can think of is that a lot of our regulars from the quarry haven't been in in a while.
{{200879108-0-82081:}}Just that he was baffled. He described fatigue fever as a strange illness that was killing workers, but he had a feeling there was more involved in the deaths. He suspected foul play, and so do I.\n\nAll right, enough chatter. Let's get back to it.
{{200879108-0-80952:}}Let's see. Ah, Cyrodiil. War-torn indeed.\n\nThese Ayleid ruins are more or less equal distance around Lake Rumare, and no matter who holds what, you'll likely be crossing enemy territory. I'd try to hide or run, but you may prefer to fight.
{{200879108-0-80665:}}Amazing, just like the fable. Do you remember when I said I thought part of it was missing?\n\nI think that was the missing piece. The Dragon in the story asks Mizbi to come up with a riddle so clever not even the gods could guess it.
{{200879108-0-79201:}}We did, didn't we? Then you know my name is … Ithelia. I am what mortals call a … Daedric Prince. These echoes. I summoned them. By accident. I am losing control.\n\nThe inn … it drew me here. Called to me. I need something it can provide.
{{200879108-0-81437:}}The night before we hit the Caelum vineyard. Hooke was supposed to return for a second scout before we broke in. An extra precaution.\n\nInstead, he wanted to meet that night to talk about … us.
{{200879108-0-79438:}}Then it shall be so!
{{200879108-0-81198:}}Who do you think turned the forest against us? We weren't logging too much, just cutting down enough trees to earn a living. And we always planted new ones. \n\nThe cultists cursed us. Said if we didn't move, they'd kill us all.
{{200879108-0-81199:}}Tree creatures and animals attacked. It was awful! They came out of nowhere and started killing everyone. You're the first thing we've seen that hasn't attacked us since it started. \n\nThis camp is cursed! We should have left a long time ago.
{{200879108-0-79679:}}I was. Still am, I suppose. My commanding officer granted me leave to put my father's affairs in order. When that's done … then I'll decide if I'm still needed here or if my place is back with the West Weald Legion.
{{200879108-0-81860:}}There aren't many Votaries in the order right now. Part of why I joined up. \n\nI tried the adept's life, before that. Being a Lamp Knight suits me better. Even if I still get called on for my portal magic just as much as before.
{{200879108-0-81861:}}Firandil is … well, he's not much fun at parties. But put him in front of a stack of moldy old tomes and he'll have them organized, cataloged, and analyzed faster than you can say "eye of Magnus" three times fast.
{{200879108-0-81862:}}Never. I've learned about drinks from across Tamriel, and none of these ingredients sound familiar.\n\nBut that won't stop me. Maybe we can bring this drink back into popularity.
{{200879108-0-81864:}}Ulfsild left a number of echoes, instructional illusions, scattered throughout the library. Their aim is to guide you through the process of contacting the Luminaries. Making allies of them once again.\n\nThere's one just behind you. See for yourself.
{{200879108-0-81867:}}Mostly that they seem to be some sort of Daedric cult. And that they grow more hostile every time we receive a new report about them. They're quickly becoming a menace throughout the province!
{{200879108-0-78781:}}I'm not sure that helps us. There are Ayleid ruins scattered all over West Weald. Any one of them could be Miscarcand, and it's not like I can look it up in any books.\n\nAnd that memory confirms it. We were wrong about the wildburn seeds.
{{200879108-0-78783:}}Leramil could explain it better, but I'll try. As I understand it, Ayleid wells are supposed to collect magicka. They harness starlight—the pure power of Aetherius. Miscarcand was the capital city of a powerful kingdom. Its well must be huge!
{{200879108-0-78782:}}Of course! If Ithelia uses her powers to reveal Miscarcand to Nantharion, the location should appear on the Skein! Open it up and see if the map has changed, friend.
{{200879108-0-78784:}}I don't know. Refound the Ayleid Empire? Restore Ithelia to her ancient might? They could do anything they can imagine! The fate of West Weald might depend on us stopping them from using the well.\n\nWe need to get to Vashabar, friend.
{{200879108-0-78788:}}Take Abolisher. An Ayleid ruin of a city as powerful as Miscarcand will have dangerous traps, maybe powerful undead—I have a feeling we're going to need that blade before we're done here.\n\nGo on. I'm right behind you.
{{200879108-0-81542:}}Between Bella and I, I think we can get Octavius to change his views. He'll help us with the others. \n\nEveryone was too blinded by their fear of the Goblins to see Jerntann for the crook that he was. We can change that.
{{200879108-0-78259:}}Now don't for a moment think that Lazen being a dog makes him any less important than the Blue Aedral. He didn't hesitate to try to protect me and the caravan. It's only right that we do everything we can to bring him back safely.
{{200879108-0-80737:}}You must traverse the land in search of seven orbs. Only with orbs in hand, when the Warrior is high in the night sky, can you wish — .\n\nI kid. They're right here. Only complete those that make you feel the most buoyant. I'll handle the rest.
{{200879108-0-80736:}}The kind of games that make people feel lighter. Games that show how buoyant life can be. There are many who need the help of my benevolent and loving tendrils.
{{200879108-0-80733:}}She said that might happen. I hoped she was mistaken. She often was.\n\nWell, no Ulfsild no problem, Not-Ulfsild! You have a naturally buoyant spirit, I can tell. This will be an effervescent experience. Let us begin.
{{200879108-0-80730:}}Don't tell me! I want to guess.\n\nWhat has a wide mouth yet never speaks with its own voice? It's a well, right? Because when you speak into a well, it speaks back in an echo.
{{200879108-0-81276:}}You think I hesitate? Did you not see how I carved the others? That was to get their attention. No, I want this elf to see her death approaching, to know horror in her final moments. Just like my wife and son!
{{200879108-0-81271:}}Oh yes. I was delivering letters when it happened. A terrible crackling sound and the smell of burnt hair. All at once the town erupted into chaos. I dropped everything I was carrying and ran. I'm lucky to have made it out alive.
{{200879108-0-81273:}}He's on edge, ready to lash out. It's how I felt after learning my old comrades were being killed. Only worse.\n\nApproach Caelum—carefully! Get him talking about his family, and keep his attention. I'll sneak around to free Valenia.
{{200879108-0-81405:}}Ah, there's the trick. We don't. Ulfsild underwent trials to prove her worth, to gain their trust. But that was lifetimes ago.\n\nAll we can hope to do now is find the Luminaries and remind them of their promise to Ulfsild. The rest is up to you.
{{200879108-0-78786:}}Sounds like something she'd do. We'd better head in and find her before she tries to take on who-knows-how-many Shardborn and Recollection warriors.\n\nBut if this is Miscarcand, that won't be all we'll have to deal with.
{{200879108-0-79053:}}Thank Arkay, this is the end of it. I can already sense the necromantic energy waning. The air feels lighter, somehow.
{{200879108-0-79051:}}This was all for Beragon's benefit. You're just an unintended spectator. I brought Beragon here to remind him of his Ayleid heritage.\n\nThe Recollection remembers their past. This land belonged to the Ayleids, and we Bosmer are their rightful heirs.
{{200879108-0-79057:}}I could, but let's think of this as a teachable moment. A final examination, so to speak. You should work this one out on your own. I'll be here to supervise.
{{200879108-0-79054:}}Were I to put my vast expertise to use here, I'd venture that the solution to releasing that barrier lies in this epitaph.
{{200879108-0-79058:}}The fifth retainer was a Nede, unnamed in the chronicles. They sealed these ruins to protect the Emblem. The five loyal retainers should be dead after all these years, but with powerful magics, you never know.
{{200879108-0-81308:}}Heed my sage advice, assistant, and there will be no problems at all. You might even learn something.
{{200879108-0-81304:}}I'll get my shoulder patched up, and then I'll journey with the rest to Marbruk. I believe there is some good we can do together. Like we did today.\n\nAnd now, I must see to Valenia's safety.
{{200879108-0-80158:}}I don't think I can bring myself to attack a Goblin. I'll only slow you down in there. \n\nI'll meet you on the western side of Gray's Hollow when you're done. I probably shouldn't stay in one spot for too long.
{{200879108-0-81306:}}Honestly, I have always felt they forsook me when I fell into thievery. But I continued to pray out of fear. And believe they were responsible for everything that went wrong for me.\n\nI should have realized I suffered from my own choices.
{{200879108-0-81301:}}I will continue to follow my calling, but with a lighter heart. The cost of my choices is mine to bear—like what happened here at Caelum Vineyard. But today, our choices saved Valenia.\n\nAnd I have you to thank for your guidance.
{{200879108-0-81300:}}Yes, but dear Narsis lives for that type of adventure! That is why he needs someone to help him in his adversity. To help rein in his enthusiasm.
{{200879108-0-81303:}}I made mistakes, but I also stood with true friends. They can help me make things right—there's still time. I don't need to run away again. I can be there for Noraine and Regomor.\n\nAnd yes, Hooke too.
{{200879108-0-81590:}}Ridiculous! Clendagal belongs here. I want him to see the world from the top of the canopy, not the bottom of the forest floor. \n\nAnd after King Nantharion's lies and betrayal, I need my son by my side more than ever.
{{200879108-0-81064:}}It's the Wood Elves, all right? Their long lives. Their ethereal beauty. I always wanted to be as beautiful as them. I'm ashamed to admit all the jealous thoughts I've had.\n\nWithout logic or restraint, I don't know what my vanity will do to them.
{{200879108-0-81302:}}I think it's time to make my way to Black Marsh. After we've all had our sit-down, maybe. Not really my home, but I have some kin there.\n\nAnd it might be good to steer clear of the taverns for now.
{{200879108-0-81065:}}I should join you this time. I can be rather headstrong when I'm in a mood. \n\nI'll go ahead to Dawnwood and meet you in the town of Vashabar. Ask if anyone has seen something that could lead us to my vanity. I doubt she's being subtle. Find me there.
{{200879108-0-81068:}}She does? Wait, it's coming back now. \n\nI'm part of her, aren't I? I'm her fear. That's right. And the other one, the scary Belienne, she's part of us, too. This whole time, I've been running away from myself. I'm such a fool.
{{200879108-0-81348:}}By that I assume you've encountered General Lavinia.
{{200879108-0-80953:}}I'm not normally one to advocate pickpocketing, but I know of these merchants in the Rift. You can find them in Riften, Nimalten, and Shor's Stone.\n\nMake them sorry for promising miracles from their overpriced cure-alls. Just don't get caught.
{{200879108-0-81262:}}I'll remain on duty until more reinforcements arrive from Skingrad. Until then, my arrows and the remaining exhausted guards are the only things keeping these people safe.
{{200879108-0-81686:}}They fill many roles, often acting as bodyguards for powerful members or guardians of ancient magics.\n\nThere aren't many knights in the order, especially compared to the number of mages in the guild.
{{200879108-0-80541:}}That would be hard. This place is more of a fortress than a settlement. Fortunately, Tribune Alea came up with a plan. Not a particularly sophisticated plan, but I think it will work.
{{200879108-0-80544:}}Unusual? Well, this one does not like to talk out of turn, but ….\n\nDro'vir hears that Lady Valente wants to be more involved in running the vineyard, but Lord Valente refuses to include her. This one wonders why he even married her.
{{200879108-0-80546:}}Just that he invited some important guests. He's been working on the new grapes for a special vintage since he returned, and he's very proud of it. Says it's going to make him even more rich and powerful.\n\nCan that be possible? This one is unsure.
{{200879108-0-80549:}}Yes, it's right through those doors to the west. He's growing weird mushrooms and has all kinds of alchemical equipment. \n\nDestroy his equipment and burn the mushrooms. That should put an end to his vile experiments!
{{200879108-0-81709:}}What happened is that we defeated Ithelia and Torvesard, exiled the Prince of Paths to a remote reality, and kept Apocrypha from being transformed into a new Mirrormoor.\n\nOr did you have a more specific question?
{{200879108-0-81708:}}She's probably shaken by seeing all the destruction from the groundquake. I know I am. Who wouldn't be?\n\nOnce we find whatever it is we're supposed to see, she'll be better. A good discovery always cheers her up.
{{200879108-0-81700:}}Why wouldn't I be? All Bosmer can trace their lineage directly to the ancient Ayleids. Well, almost all.\n\nThis history surprises many people and can be controversial. But my research definitively shows that we're the inheritors of that legacy.
{{200879108-0-81703:}}A disgusting bigotry toward Bosmer pervades scholars from other cultures. To them, we're not worthy of such a noble ancestry. But plainly, they're wrong.\n\nYou should read my book. It contains all the evidence needed to persuade any doubter.
{{200879108-0-81702:}}And you should be, too! The legacy of the ancient Ayleids flows in our blood! You and I, all of the Bosmer—we're the inheritors of this great legacy.\n\nSome find this notion controversial, but my research reveals the truth.
{{200879108-0-81705:}}We grew up together. He started on a path of a warrior and hunter, while I trained as a greenspeaker. He had an interest in scholarly pursuits as well, and we bonded over shared studies.\n\nHe became a good friend.
{{200879108-0-81704:}}Greenspeakers are a vital part of any Bosmer community and I cherish my role. Shaping the Green is an art. It involves merging my voice with the song of nature and guiding how things grow.\n\nWe don't control nature. Instead, we have a conversation.
{{200879108-0-81707:}}This isn't the first time. She loves showing me old artifacts or walking me through fallen dungeons. I quite like that she comes to me when excited about a discovery.\n\nShe is acting a tad off, though. Usually she's enthusiastic, not so aggressive.
{{200879108-0-81476:}}The two of us recovered the Skein of Secrets. You and Tribune Alea saved Feldagard Keep and found Abolisher. And you discovered the Lamp of Clarity at the Outcast Inn. You learned something about Ithelia, too.\n\nWe finally have an advantage.
{{200879108-0-81474:}}Why not? I don't need a husband for that, and I have twice the mind for business than Gallio ever did.\n\nHmm. If you find yourself in possession of a large fortune in the future, come see me. Perhaps I'll be ready to give marriage another go by then.
{{200879108-0-79157:}}Not a clue. Innkeepers get plenty of requests they don't understand. Our job isn't to ask questions. We're here to listen and help customers relax and forget their problems.\n\nThough, maybe that's different for this patron.
{{200879108-0-79156:}}I knew she wanted a drink! But Sage's Dream? Never heard of it. And I've memorized every recipe in every edition of the Innkeeper's Helper.\n\nWait, I just remembered. We might be in luck yet.
{{200879108-0-79155:}}All are welcome in Dawnwood, no matter their beliefs. Some follow the Green Pact, others seek a new path, the Dawnway. You know, the roots of the Dawnway are all around us. Which is why I think the Green provided this new forest and led us here.
{{200879108-0-79159:}}The previous owner left junk all over the courtyard. I've been sorting through it and noticed a book on obscure and ancient drinks. Maybe it contains a recipe for Sage's Dream.\n\nGo back there and find that book!
{{200879108-0-82050:}}A grizzled old knight who has fallen from his horse one too many times. He's adopted the concept of justice as if he's the only one of us with a moral compass.\n\nIt would be pathetic if not for his stewardship of that delightful little creature.
{{200879108-0-82051:}}A vacuous gas-bag with pretentions of do-goodery. A limitless existence, unimaginable power, and the best he can think to do with it is slip sweets and coins into the pockets of the downtrodden.
{{200879108-0-82052:}}A pompous old goat with an inferiority complex. He is terrified the power we wield might be misused. He's spent centuries of existence wishing he, and by extension I, did not exist.
{{200879108-0-82053:}}Perhaps the Netch makes the lives of mortals easier. But we are beings of pure magic who, as far as I am aware, will live for eons. Why is it not the Netch's goal to make whole civilizations bettered, more focused? Maddening.
{{200879108-0-82054:}}His lasting accomplishments can be counted on one claw. He is so blinded by a pedantic code … and yet. I must give him credit for ensuring the survival of the Fox. \n\nEven a world-weary creature such as myself must bow an elegant head to that beast.
{{200879108-0-82055:}}We're immortal beings made from magic itself. What responsibilities do we have? \n\nTo me it seems irresponsible not to focus on intellectual pursuits, on improvements in thought.
{{200879108-0-82057:}}Oh, right. Nantharion told you I was called Beragon Sharp-Dagger, the hero of Ninglenirre Pass. Look, I happened to be in the right place at the right time. I helped save some Wood Elves caught between bandits and a rampaging lurcher.\n\nNo big deal.
{{200879108-0-81470:}}Scribing is buoyancy of the mind, floating in your soul. Lift within your very skills and spells.\n\nI find the idea of everyone doing something all the same way not just boring, but dreadfully tragic.
{{200879108-0-80857:}}It allows a Bosmer community to determine its future. To step in where growth has stagnated. If Laeni and Clendagal perform the rite, Vashabar can make its voice known. \n\nAnd not even Nedolir or Minth can silence the voice of the village.
{{200879108-0-79291:}}She must be held accountable for her crimes. She can't have gone far.
{{200879108-0-79072:}}I understand. Sometimes he gets so involved, I have to drag him away. Knowledge and research always come first for Narsis. He's a rock-solid scholar.
{{200879108-0-82029:}}You have your tendrils twisted on that. Ulfsild was the one who taught me. Oh I shared my views and opinions with her, as I'm happy to do with you.\n\nBut we Luminaries learned as much from the Archmage as she learned from us.
{{200879108-0-78594:}}No? And why don't I believe you? Oh, don't worry. I have no desire to reveal Fennorian's deception to my husband. Not before I learn what's going on here, the same as you.\n\nBe so kind as to let Fennorian know I'd like to speak to him when he's free.
{{200879108-0-78698:}}Betu was safeguarding the fortune this whole time? It's a strange request, leaving the remaining fortune to Betu and her staff, but I wouldn't dare go against my aunt's wishes.\n\nHow sweet, Lord Betu of Weatherleah.
{{200879108-0-79540:}}Outrageous! I'll … I'll. I'll drink my jagga and stand here, I suppose. Neither Minth nor I can stand in the way of tradition. \n\nEven if I don't like it.
{{200879108-0-78708:}}No power? A path where Daedra and magicka do not exist? Hmm. It would need to be a place where my Daedric power held no sway and could gain no foothold.\n\nI feel the tendrils of my discarded power searching, reaching toward me. We must hurry, mortal.
{{200879108-0-78705:}}A path that is better than the solution I devised so long ago? Inconceivable! Do not overstep your bounds, mortal.
{{200879108-0-78707:}}Yes, my reflections. When we walked the Many Paths at the Outcast Inn, we visited realities where things had gone another way. I am different in those realities, but that is not choice. That is consequence. The aftermath of alternate events.
{{200879108-0-78706:}}Do not use my own words against me! Still, you are correct in that regard. Very well, chosen of fate. What do you suggest we do with Ithelia to preserve our reality?
{{200879108-0-81410:}}I haven't a clue. Though, of course, I can imagine the transportation of such a rare delicacy would catch the eye of many a thief. In truth, it was bound to happen eventually. It'd be best to just wash our hands of the loss and move on.
{{200879108-0-81413:}}Oh, you did? Well, isn't that marvelous. I didn't realize Orissa found someone so capable. This is truly a relief. You lifted a great weight from my shoulders.
{{200879108-0-78800:}}Abolisher? We saw Vargas use it to open portals. And we just watched you use it to seal portals as well. All right, cut us a path through this collapsed passage, comrade. We'll catch up to those bastards yet!
{{200879108-0-78402:}}Because that's who built them. The so-called Heartland High Elves of ancient Tamriel. I'm not really a scholar of Ayleid history, but I know their empire collapsed a very long time ago. \n\nBe careful. Even unoccupied ruins can be dangerous.
{{200879108-0-78801:}}No, but it did mention his best vintage. A dark joke referring to my days as a vampire. And the place where Old Desius slept it off? That's the bank vault.\n\nDamn Balandrus! Why did he have to return to this town, of all places?
{{200879108-0-79286:}}As I said, they are two of the three relics Mora had created when Ithelia became a threat. He enlisted other Daedric Princes against her and they made the relics.\n\nAbolisher was forged by Boethiah to cut a path to Ithelia no matter where she walked.
{{200879108-0-81181:}}I got lucky. I fell behind to adjust a loose bootstrap. When I heard the attack start, I slipped into the shadows and have been running ever since.\n\nLook, the Daedra have a portal. They're filling the catacombs with Daedric forces to attack Skingrad!
{{200879108-0-81516:}}Are you worried I'm going to play a trick on her? Don't you worry, if Nahlia weren't buoyant, she'd be the first I'd help. But she's been quite floaty these days, and it's none of my doing.\n\nI want her to help you move with the winds of the soul.
{{200879108-0-80470:}}Absolutely. Deep in the ruins, our ancestors inlaid beautiful depictions of Ayleid life and love into the walls, celebrating the community those grounds once nurtured. \n\nNow that art is shattered. But even those fragments hold meaning in Vashabar.
{{200879108-0-80473:}}If we get to stay and I can continue my training to be a greenspeaker, it would mean the blighted world to me. \n\nI want the village to know I never intended to run away from my calling. That this was only ever about our union, about our love.
{{200879108-0-80479:}}No, but I do. I shall be Master Bogvir, the vampire I took this invitation from. And you shall be my guest. The invitation allows for at least one guest and any mortal blood servants I wish to bring along. In fact, it encourages I bring some.
{{200879108-0-81072:}}Hah! More like I revealed her true form!\n\nHis stupid little wife was tromping around the forest like a dumb animal. So I decided to make her outside match what was inside. She didn't even fight back. She must've known she deserved it.
{{200879108-0-81070:}}There's only one option. I have to face my vanity. \n\nI can be petty at times, but I've never been prone to such dark magic. At least, not consciously. I suspect something's been festering inside me for too long. Maybe together we can clear the air.
{{200879108-0-81388:}}Wouldn't that be wonderful? It's a slim hope, but yes. The knot is filled with possibilities. Perhaps there is a way to learn more about it. \n\nBut keeping the knot's unstable nature contained is a victory in and of itself.
{{200879108-0-81967:}}We're all in above our heads here. Don't look to me for answers. Luckily, our foxy friend might have helped us out. When he saw me, he dropped one of the pages! \n\nIt's the first page to the fable, with Ulfsild's notes clear as day.
{{200879108-0-80701:}}Go looking for a focal point near the echo you accessed earlier. If I know Ulfsild, and I do, she'd have made sure her notes were somewhere nearby.\n\nNahlia also seemed eager to help, I'd go check in with her. She might have leads all her own.
{{200879108-0-81966:}}I managed to catch sight of our pest just before you arrived, and it's … well. It's a fox. Possibly the fox Ulfsild mentioned in the echo?\n\nIt was enormous, and seemed intelligent. Honestly it looked very surprised to see me.
{{200879108-0-81662:}}Eveli's traveling around Tamriel, leading the life of a wandering hero. She writes now and then to tell me stories of her adventures. I'm proud of who she's become.\n\nIf I hear from her, I'll let her know I saw you!
{{200879108-0-78354:}}I lost a lot of good men and women to these Recollection fanatics. The last report about them urged caution, but it never said they had their own army!\n\nWere you able to complete the mission? Did you ignite all four signal fires?
{{200879108-0-78352:}}Not very much, I'm afraid. I only just received the order to reclaim the tool packs the camp borrowed from the Legion.\n\nI can tell you the camp lies to the south, in what I understand is now the area of devastation at the edge of the new forest.
{{200879108-0-78353:}}As I understand it, yes. Which could explain why they have yet to return the tool packs. Unfortunately, the Legion can't be everywhere, not in these trying times.\n\nI suppose you could check on the workers while you're there, if you're so inclined.
{{200879108-0-78350:}}You're right. Ithelia has changed. And reflecting might just be the key!\n\nI read about a relic created by a mortal wizard, a mirror that revealed the innermost thoughts and dreams of the viewer. Leramil and I must consult some ancient texts!
{{200879108-0-78359:}}Have you ever met a Reachfolk? They're a superstitious lot. As I understand it now, their warriors carry these trinkets into battle to appease their gods or give them luck or something. Anyway, they also have some sort of spiritual connotation.
{{200879108-0-80874:}}I went out on my own to go find Burnbiscuit, but the twisted creatures around the expedition's wreckage were much stronger than I'd expected. Especially the bog dogs, as if they weren't a menace before.
{{200879108-0-80875:}}Oh, I appreciate your concern, but I refuse to leave without Burnbiscuit. It's my duty as a legionary to fulfill the wishes of Count Calantius and the people of Skingrad, even at the cost of my own life.
{{200879108-0-80876:}}Burnbiscuit? He's a cub that the count rescued on his travels. He's a little scamp, always poking his nose into things. He gets his name from eating burned biscuits in the kitchen. And he loves apples. Can't get enough.
{{200879108-0-80877:}}He is. He and the count have been inseparable. Now that he's missing, Count Calantius will be bereft with grief. We need to bring him back.
{{200879108-0-81628:}}A mere conjecture. But if this lost quarter of Fargrave was once part of Ithelia's realm, it has fallen into ruin during her long absence.\n\nWell, we will not find our allies or the answers we seek standing here. Let us continue.
{{200879108-0-78805:}}You've been busy, friend!\n\nHmm … did you learn anything at Feldagard Keep and the Outcast Inn that might clear up the last nagging questions I've got about the Hoperoot map? Tell me what happened.
{{200879108-0-81621:}}I suppose when a magical being asks you to help out, you help out. This will be an interesting story to tell my parents when I head home for New Life fest.\n\nSee you when I catch up, adventurer.
{{200879108-0-81627:}}The Shardborn are here in force. And in my previous visits, I never saw anything like those crystalline growths ahead. I think Ithelia reshaped this part of Fargrave when she came this way.\n\nWhich may have affected our portal, too.
{{200879108-0-81624:}}Depends who you ask. Some believe the Green grew the forest and led us here to establish Vashabar. Those who follow the Dawnway see it as a sign we were meant to reclaim the land of our ancestors—provided you believe we're descended from Ayleids.
{{200879108-0-79471:}}You see what the once-important Fort Colovia has been reduced to? Where once we protected the wealth of the empire, now we watch over invitations to the count's gala.\n\nDo whatever you want in there, as long as you also ring the bell.
{{200879108-0-79479:}}No! He can't marry the daughter of a greenspeaker. The outdated customs of the Green Pact have held my people back for far too long. \n\nI understand what you and Ciiril tried to do here. But my mind is made up. Now excuse me. I need to find my son.
{{200879108-0-80974:}}This one had hopes and lots of research, but no proof. What Keshargo has is trust. He trusted Neletai's arca, Hermorah, and you.
{{200879108-0-81914:}}We're one of the noble houses of Rivenspire that just happens to be a coven of vampires. But we're good vampires. We only drink from willing donors and never to excess. Our mission is to hunt and put down the more ravenous examples of our kind.
{{200879108-0-81916:}}As I said, I was trying to pick up the trail of the Terrors, violent vampires that were last seen heading toward the Weald, when I found the invitation. Another troublesome vampire I was forced to deal with had it among his possessions.
{{200879108-0-81917:}}That old place? What happened there? No, don't tell me. I'll hear about it later. Let me help a little here and then I'll see you in Skingrad.\n\nAnd don't worry. I'll take good care of this strange blade.
{{200879108-0-81910:}}From a very young age, Archmage Ulfsild found she could see the current of magic as it flowed across Nirn.\n\nFaintly at times, more strongly in others. A rare and precious gift, one granted by Magnus himself no doubt.
{{200879108-0-80789:}}Well, some clans here hold tight to the Green Pact, but others follow a new path—the Dawnway. They both have merit, but the faithful on either side don't see it that way.\n\nI expect more from Dominion folk than petty arguments!
{{200879108-0-78771:}}I had hoped that we put an end to the wildburn threat when we interrupted Nantharion's ritual at Hoperoot. What did you do about the seeds?
{{200879108-0-79694:}}I need a break from all this philosophy. Agmund and I will have the whole trip back to Evermore to babble about this. Thank you.
{{200879108-0-79692:}}I don't doubt it! We all must confront our inner Molag Bal at some point. That's the struggle of sapience—we cannot control what we desire. As a fellow philosopher, I applaud you.
{{200879108-0-80228:}}They're not hungry. Anything they kill is left where it is. I'd say the Goblins are sending us a message. But no one on the farms has done anything. Pim checked!\n\nI can't blame the farmers for being nervous.
{{200879108-0-80227:}}I don't have a clue. They've never been this angry before.\n\nMy uncle and the other farmers can forgive a few sheep here and there, but they'll lose everything if the Goblins continue like this.
{{200879108-0-80226:}}We do not. Julian and I have already begun speculating, based on some early hints. \n\nOur best guess? It's Ulfsild's private study. But I suppose we'll find out, won't we?
{{200879108-0-80223:}}A part of me hates to see valuable equipment go to waste, but we can't allow more of the Vesper Valente to be created. Now come on, let's do this.
{{200879108-0-81843:}}We'll have all the time in the world to talk after the magic here is quelled. If the altar isn't stabilized our conversation options will be very limited. Because we will be dead.
{{200879108-0-81848:}}Eyevea was taken by the Daedric Prince Sheogorath, off to the Shivering Isles. Shalidor made a foolish pact with the Prince, and the island was lost in the bargain. \n\nThe Scholarium was lost as well, along with much of Ulfsild's precious work.
{{200879108-0-81849:}}Impressive, and well timed. The Mad God's discovery of the Scholarium would have been catastrophic.\n\nI felt the shift when Eyevea returned to Nirn, but had no idea what called it home. I can think of no one better suited to inherit Ulfsild's legacy.
{{200879108-0-79871:}}Indeed. It is my shrine. But the Elenglynn I knew was a proud citadel, not a crumbling ruin. Here, the people worshiped me and I forged a pact to protect them. To open the Many Paths before them.\n\nWait. I sense … something. A part of Hermaeus Mora.
{{200879108-0-79873:}}The Echonir? Yes, that is what the Abyssal Cephaliarch called it. A clever little device he wrought to find and remove things that belonged to me. Thoughts. Memories. Truths he did not want anyone to know.\n\nShow me. I wish to see what it reveals.
{{200879108-0-81668:}}He's read the reports Irnard's been sending along, and he's fascinated. Which is both amazing and slightly terrifying. \n\nApparently he's wrapped up in a lot of hush-hush meetings recently? So who knows when he'll get down here.
{{200879108-0-81669:}}About as happy as she gets, yes. She said some things about my living up to potential, commended me on my valor. A lot of good, knightly words. \n\nShe doesn't wear her heart on her sleeve, but I know she's proud of what we've accomplished.
{{200879108-0-82151:}}Back to Necrom, I suppose. Eventually. After I get to spend a little time with Leramil. At least, I hope we can spend some time. She's very busy, you know. With all the forbidden knowledge research and everything. I'm rambling again, aren't I? Sorry!
{{200879108-0-82150:}}If you hadn't noticed, Wood Elves love their epithets. I happen to use daggers, so someone along the way called me that. And it stuck. At least until I retired and became a scribe. \n\nLuckily, no one at court ever called me Sharp-Quill.
{{200879108-0-82153:}}What I always do—my duty! My service to the Legion and Count Calantius never ends. And West Weald still needs a protector.\n\nYou were a great help, comrade. Indispensable. But I'll rebuild my cohort and we'll take it from here.
{{200879108-0-81594:}}My father. He was a successful merchant, but I barely remember him. He died when I was very young.\n\nHe left me a great deal of gold so I could study and make something of myself. I'm grateful for that. When I was of age, I joined the Legion.
{{200879108-0-81599:}}No, I'm sorry. If they want to go, I respect their decision. But … hmm. Maybe old Spinner Belwelas might be able to help you. \n\nHe's keeper of the Wilderhall here in Vashabar.
{{200879108-0-78914:}}Not exactly. But I have all sorts of tinctures, reagents, and solvents. Many of them can be combined to create poisons and unstable compounds that could explode given the right circumstances.
{{200879108-0-78915:}}Hmm. You'll want to go with something simple. I'd suggest grabbing some alchemical oil and a few combustion canisters. They won't make a perfect weapon, but if you can mix them, set them, ignite them, and run, they do make a rather large boom.
{{200879108-0-78916:}}Balandrus always wanted more gold. Then more blood. Now he's calling himself the Terror. Sounds like he wants power now.\n\nCome to think of it, the stories of the Gray Host always fascinated him. Maybe they put a very bad idea into his head.
{{200879108-0-78912:}}I saw the darkness growing in Balandrus, but it was Tham who convinced me to find a cure. He said I was better than what the rest of the gang was becoming.\n\nNow, my sword reminds me of myself in those darkest days. It's thirsty and craves blood.
{{200879108-0-78913:}}After we became vampires, we remained outlaws. We took blood from the recently dead and dying. We had honor.\n\nOnly a few of us accepted the curse at first, but eventually Balandrus convinced us there was more blood to be had than gold. He was wrong.
{{200879108-0-78919:}}The grapes were developed using alchemy. They've been infused with blood and I find the aroma tantalizing, but I dare not try one. Look what consuming the grapes did to the death hound.\n\nOur next step is to attend the auction. You shall be my guest.
{{200879108-0-78276:}}What's this now? Has word already spread of my ineptitude? My abject failure? Has the Verdulis family already dragged my name through the coals? Please, kindhearted and dashing adventurer, end your silence and tell me!
{{200879108-0-78271:}}It was horrible being surrounded by snarling beasts. Then the brigand, wearing a ghastly mask might I add, started barking orders at us. It was either I surrender the dowry or forfeit my life.
{{200879108-0-78958:}}Now you doubt my expertise? Look, we only detected these instabilities because of their effect on nearby threads of fate. And that reality tear … if I didn't have all my eyes on it, I wouldn't even know it was there.\n\nThis is Ithelia, all right.
{{200879108-0-78272:}}Absurd, I know, but it's almost more romantic. The tidal forces of commerce leaving us marooned on the shores of love. We've written each other, of course. And beneath the polite formalities I do believe Amaurel nurtures a spark of love for me.
{{200879108-0-78278:}}My Amaurel? What would drive her to steal her own dowry? Surely there must be some misunderstanding. These barbaric acts are far beneath her, let alone the Verdulis family name.\n\nAt least it explains the warm rush I felt from her commands.
{{200879108-0-80548:}}I am, but as soon as we walked in, I was hit with sudden pangs of hunger. Not unlike when I smelled those grapes, but much stronger.\n\nLuckily, I carry a flask of blood for times of need. I'll just find an out-of-the way spot to take a sip.
{{200879108-0-80715:}}The Netch is a trickster, but it's also proud of its wit. Getting the upper hand with someone like that is simple. Flatter them.\n\nReminds me of a Covenant knight I once met who tried all night to get my attention. But that's a story for another day.
{{200879108-0-80714:}}It's said the people of the city just slipped away in small bands, seeking the safety of Valenwood. Eventually no one was left but the last king, Morimath. But all that's little more than legend and speculation. No one really knows for sure.
{{200879108-0-79658:}}Oh, yes! And Agmund comes from Winterhold! But despite our differences, we've become fast friends. Every year we make our way to Skingrad to debate and discuss. But this year we got distracted by the Molag Bal Paradox and are temporarily lost.
{{200879108-0-79226:}}Shh! All my comrades know about my past is that I studied in distant lands. I do not care to have them speculating about my loyalties.\n\nAre you Psijic? I do not recall seeing you around Ceporah Tower.
{{200879108-0-80382:}}The family caught us. We made a break for it … and people got hurt.\n\nThanks for ruining what's left of my bottle. I'll take my chances here. Besides, with my tab, I'd lose my tail if I tried to run off to Skingrad.
{{200879108-0-80380:}}Our last job. The one we got sent to prison for. He didn't tell you?\n\nWe got greedy after living off caravans. Hooke scouts a vineyard, the Caelum estate. Says the family's traveling. A quick smash and grab, no one gets hurt.
{{200879108-0-80386:}}Well, well. Aren't you a generous soul?\n\nI'd play a song for you from my vossa-satl, but I bartered it. For, well, you know.
{{200879108-0-80384:}}Really? It's a healthy amount of gold. That's the problem with drinking as an Argonian. It takes a lot to put us in our cups. By the time the ale kicks in, all your coin's been kicked out.
{{200879108-0-81039:}}Make like the locals and stick to the shadows. You should be able to pickpocket the creatia right out of their … shadowstuff. Whatever they're made of. I know you can do it.\n\nYou could kill them, but they didn't really do anything to us. You know?
{{200879108-0-78666:}}The note says that Edric served Lady Weatherleah poisoned tea the day she died, but the cook had already left the grounds. Otho confirmed that himself. And this letter says that Pelena was present for tea, but she said she was out all morning.
{{200879108-0-78667:}}A good question, but the memorial may be a greater clue. Lady Weatherleah had gone to great lengths to find her son, but was certain of his death to raise this memorial.\n\nOur Uriel may well be an imposter, but do not give away our upper hand.
{{200879108-0-78665:}}Why would Edric lead us to Uriel's memorial and then kill himself? And earlier, the cook warned us of some mysterious danger. Could he have met the fate he was trying to save us from? Too many bodies and cryptic messages for this one's liking.
{{200879108-0-78662:}}Hard to expect more from a raw recruit, but I'm glad he stepped up in the end. I'd say you inspired him, but I think he had it in him from the beginning. He just needed to believe in himself and take the leap.
{{200879108-0-78663:}}Interesting. He really spells it out, doesn't he? Alchemically enhanced mushrooms used as fertilizer for alchemically treated grape seeds ….\n\nAnd the hunger. I wasn't losing control. It's an effect of the grapes. Well, that's a relief!
{{200879108-0-78660:}}His duty? He's practically a hero! We'll make a legionary out of him yet! \n\nIf he survives ringing the warning bell, I have a feeling he'll be one of the best of us someday.
{{200879108-0-78661:}}That coward of Ontus nonsense again? I told Calvo just to ignore the insults, but he couldn't let it go.\n\nStill, there's no doubt he's got courage. I just hope he survives long enough for us to show him how much we appreciate his efforts.
{{200879108-0-78668:}}The cook, you say? Well, as close as any young heir is with their staff. Now that I think about it, I always did find him strange. Always one for the shadows. I'm glad Pelena saw fit to fire him. I only wish I were here to do it myself.
{{200879108-0-78595:}}Mizzik was told that Lady Weatherleah died alone in her library; but could she have met with this stranger only to become their victim? We must question the family, but do not mention the note.
{{200879108-0-81416:}}Me? Why would I know? I don't run in such circles! I'm but a simple caravan leader whose only friends are my horses. And the winery workers, of course!\n\nYes, all my dear, close friends at the winery.
{{200879108-0-79534:}}Indeed. Hermaeus Mora can find an acceptable path and I can show him how to open the way. And then we would need you to use Abolisher. To destroy the path so that I could never return to this reality.\n\nAsk Mora if this will suffice.
{{200879108-0-79306:}}Entangled realities? A strange tale, friend. That's a problem rather beyond my experience. I'm glad you were there to sort things out. And you recovered a lamp? Sounds like some sort of relic.\n\nIt might be important.
{{200879108-0-79799:}}Each knight takes a solemn vow to protect the Mages Guild, its members and its goals.\n\nWhen we're available, we also go in first to deal with situations like this. Trying to assess the unknown before letting the adepts get their hands dirty.
{{200879108-0-81994:}}It was the damnedest thing. In a flash, the rolling hills and vineyards were replaced by a thick jungle! And then those Wood Elves moved in and established the city of Vashabar.\n\nYou can imagine why the count is concerned.
{{200879108-0-81995:}}In addition to my duties as a Legion tribune, I perform special missions for the count. Right now, I'm looking into the various troubles plaguing the Weald. Rumors of cults and Daedra roaming the countryside, whatever's going on in the new forest.
{{200879108-0-81996:}}It was the damnedest thing. In a flash, the rolling hills and vineyards were replaced by a thick jungle! And then those Wood Elves moved in and established the city of Vashabar.\n\nYou can imagine why the count is concerned.
{{200879108-0-81997:}}Yes! I was so grateful I brought him sweets and trinkets for weeks! No matter how hard he asked me not to. \n\nEventually he realized how handy it is to have a little guy like me around, and we've been buddies ever since!
{{200879108-0-81990:}}Oh, you know it? It's an incredible place, isn't it? I've talked to beings from other Daedric realms, and it sounds like those Princes ask a lot of their subjects. \n\nHircine's not like that, he's a great Prince. As long as you don't get caught.
{{200879108-0-81991:}}Nope! I'm from a place where lots of people look like me. Or birds, or deer, lots of wolves. Deep forests and a night sky that goes on forever. The only bad part? \n\nSometimes the horns of the hunt sound, and we all have to run for our lives.
{{200879108-0-81992:}}No! The baker and I were friends, he fed me sometimes. Anyway, I was just about to bite into a loaf when some soldiers broke into his home.\n\nI tried to defend him but, look at me. That's when the roof came off and the Gryphon put his whole head in!
{{200879108-0-81993:}}Well, there's plenty of places I've never been. But if the fabric of the realm is thin enough, and the scent is strong enough, I can nuzzle my way through. \n\nPretty handy for steal. I mean, finding fun little trinkets.
{{200879108-0-78419:}}Because they attract all sorts of dangerous wildlife to whatever area they occupy. Take care of Oakenclaw, but place the bulletins to warn our citizens of potential danger until I can spare legionaries to do a thorough evaluation.
{{200879108-0-78418:}}Aggressions of root aren't that common. Druids say they speak with the voice of plants and protect nature where it feels threatened. \n\nI don't know why Oakenclaw claimed Lake Olo, it poses a danger to the citizens of West Weald.
{{200879108-0-80649:}}Hmm. Very well, have it your way. Inheritor or not, we'll have ample opportunity to see what kind of mind you have in there.\n\nPlace my fable upon the dais to connect my wing to the Scholarium once more.
{{200879108-0-80648:}}Hmm, fascinating. I sense the power of the Indrik about you, so clearly you're here seeking my approval. In a way, that's acting as Ulfsild's inheritor.\n\nCan we at least agree on that?
{{200879108-0-80643:}}As it happens, I'm studying to pick up Ta'agra as a second tongue. Ja'zennji Siir translates to Jode's Light in Cyrodiilic.\n\nThose ruins are just west of Dune. Though I suppose they weren't ruins in Ulfsild's time. Stay safe.
{{200879108-0-80646:}}Can I see the annotations?\n\nHere, Khaj Rawlith. That's an old ruins site in northwestern Reaper's March. Fort Grimwatch is built over it now. And the bit about the door at the end—did you notice that riddle went unsolved in the fable?
{{200879108-0-80645:}}There's a village called Willowgrove in the south of Reaper's March. As you can imagine, it's near a large grove. Of willows.\n\nI don't really care for riddles. But Nahlia said she could use the help, and that's the best I can figure.
{{200879108-0-80644:}}The monastery, Do'Krin, can be found southwest of grand Rawl'kha on a crescent moon of water.\n\nI don't wish to reveal any more. Ulfsild put her thoughts down plain enough. Have faith in your own cleverness. Good luck.
{{200879108-0-81204:}}Strange things started happening weeks ago. Strange animals coming close to the camp. Angry Wood Elves cursing at us. Some of the loggers left, but we thought they were being cowards. \n\nI wish I went with them.
{{200879108-0-81205:}}Below ground, I'd wager. In its prime, a vineyard like this would have had huge cellars for storing the wine until it matured. Some of those cellars must have survived the fire.\n\nThat's where we'll find Marcan Caelum.
{{200879108-0-81206:}}A lumber camp. Haldain told us that if we could just get the camp established here, we could take advantage of the new jungle and supply enough wood for the Weald. Maybe the whole of central Tamriel! \n\nLook where that dream led us.
{{200879108-0-81200:}}All right. Say I believe you. Then what are you doing approaching my camp?
{{200879108-0-81201:}}Cultists don't just act without cause. There's always someone giving the orders. That's what I'm trying to find out. \n\nIf I can track down why my brother's lumber camp was attacked, then I can trace it back to whoever's really responsible.
{{200879108-0-81208:}}I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. \n\nIt doesn't matter. Even if you don't believe in me, I know I can do this. Haldain and the other loggers deserve justice. I plan to get it for them.
{{200879108-0-81209:}}It is. But it's possible and that's what I need to remember. This wasn't a random event. It was a targeted attack. \n\nI know the Recollection wasn't happy about the trees being cut down. I just need to figure out who gave the order to attack the camp.
{{200879108-0-81895:}}At the start of the usurper war, the Daggerfall Covenant decided to take North Hook. They wanted it as a base for an invasion of Imperial City. We didn't let them have it.\n\nAfter our commander fell, I took charge. They retreated soon after that.
{{200879108-0-81729:}}Hey, fair enough. They're not everyone's skin of rotmeth. If you need my help, or just want to talk some ideas over, come find me. \n\nFrom everything I've read so far, the Dragon loves riddles the way the ones in the stories love gold.
{{200879108-0-81728:}}You seem the type. Even still, if you need my help, or just want to talk some ideas over, come find me. \n\nFrom everything I've read so far, the Dragon loves riddles the way the ones in the stories love gold.
{{200879108-0-81724:}}You know him? Interesting history for a Wood Elf. Traveled Tamriel as an adventurer in his youth, then became an Imperial scribe. I understand he's retired now, but word is he's investigating the Recollection.\n\nI should find him and compare notes.
{{200879108-0-78417:}}Anything that can tell us the true purpose of this auction. Vampires don't need wine, especially made from grapes that apparently poisoned a death hound.\n\nTry not to come off as too curious, though. We're supposed to be guests here, after all.
{{200879108-0-78416:}}In my experience, when leaders congregate, so does paperwork. Look for reports, letters, communiques, orders—anything that might tell us more about the Recollection and their goals in West Weald.\n\nAnything you find, bring it to me.
{{200879108-0-78411:}}They resemble ferocious senches, although the scorpion tails give them an even more menacing countenance. Very mean, very dangerous.\n\nThey're not native to West Weald. And we haven't seen many as massive as Fang and Talon.
{{200879108-0-78410:}}There were three of them. Good, reliable soldiers. I issued their armaments personally.\n\nThey should have reported back by now and I fear the worst. If I am indeed correct, it would be helpful if you can gather their equipment and return it to me.
{{200879108-0-80939:}}Where I come from folks become foxes and foxes become folks. It's a thing. I was just curious. Anyway! \n\nYou're so close to meeting the Gryphon! With this last page you should have the whole fable put back together.
{{200879108-0-78998:}}Calvo thinks he has something to prove. I was training him to become the cohort's aide-de-camp. He knows exactly where to find the items you need. \n\nHe's not my best fighter or scout, but he's dedicated and can direct you to the three items.
{{200879108-0-78999:}}It began with Torvesard. A clanless Dremora, tormented by a dream he could not remember. He came to suspect that something had been taken from him—and that Hermaeus Mora was responsible.\n\nSo Torvesard sought allies.
{{200879108-0-78992:}}Recently, the vineyards of the southwest portion of the Weald were overgrown with a thick forest. Now Wood Elves led by King Nantharion have settled the city of Vashabar.\n\nSo far these settlers have been peaceful, but Skingrad is concerned.
{{200879108-0-79797:}}I'm good with portal magic. Really good. But I'm self-taught. I can't really put it into words like one of the adepts might.\n\nI've made and examined a lot of portals. This one is odd. Unique. A door with two keyholes, waiting since the first era.
{{200879108-0-79647:}}These vats turn the mushrooms into a fertilizer for the grapes. Increase the flames under the vats by adjusting the valves. That will increase the pressure.\n\nAfter that, set fire to the mushroom planters. Then get clear before the vats explode.
{{200879108-0-81812:}}An old conversation we used to have. Maybe you'd call it an argument. We need to learn from history, but it doesn't necessarily define us. I'm no more an Ayleid just because they might have been my ancestors than a Redguard is a Yokudan.
{{200879108-0-81819:}}Other knights throw around honorifics like Sir and Dame. It's like that, a way for members to distinguish themselves. It speaks to their vows to the Order, and to their role as a light to defend the Guild.
{{200879108-0-82036:}}Ah! Is it not obvious? I mean, look at me. I am exceedingly buoyant. Perfectly voluptuous.\n\nOh, I see. You, too, hope to one day have a perfect form. Well, continue your studies, Not-Ulfsild. Someday you might ascend your imperfect vessel.
{{200879108-0-82035:}}Picture it. A wizened scholar traces arcane runes across a detailed summoning — . I'm kidding. \n\nMy birth was an accident of magic and deeply boring. It is why I try to stay so joyous and floaty. Existence is what you make of it, Not-Ulfsild.
{{200879108-0-82033:}}A heavy soul, but I think he means well. Over the years he's lost sight of what he truly wants. You might say his vision of justice is somewhat … frozen. A bit … iced over.\n\nOh right, you don't get that joke yet. That will be funny later.
{{200879108-0-82030:}}So serious, so old, so focused. Too focused for me. I prefer to let the winds carry me where they will.\n\nThe Indrik wishes we made sense, but we don't. So why let your tendrils get tangled up about it?
{{200879108-0-80947:}}You can tell Ulfsild's mate he is an old fool. And the Daedric Prince of nonsense … bah.\n\nYou have a Luminary's apology.This has not been an easy awakening. Once, my feathers were armor. My talons cut stone and my beak could rend the sky itself.
{{200879108-0-81326:}}I think so. At least for a while. Tham needs to learn how to deal with the curse. Then I need to help him figure out whether to try to live with it or seek a cure.\n\nAs for the town … that's a harder problem to solve.
{{200879108-0-79310:}}The chance that anyone's heart other than mine is still beating in this town is so low as to be nonexistent. I want to find and deal with Balandrus … the Terror ….\n\nBut I suppose I owe it to Tham to go where he pointed. Let's check the bank.
{{200879108-0-79313:}}Just see what they have to say about recent events. The deaths of their fellow workers, my father …. What they think about fatigue fever.\n\nMy father must have assumed they had something to tell him. We need to follow up on that.
{{200879108-0-79312:}}That's another death to lay at their feet, and all in the name of profit.\n\nThey planned to destroy the town, blame it all on me, and run off with their ill-gotten gold. I'm just glad you were here to help stop them.
{{200879108-0-79216:}}Yes, of course. Better not to speculate or worry needlessly. Thank you for helping me see that.
{{200879108-0-80822:}}Yes, it showed me the same. A place where Ithelia used her power? I doubt she is still on Nirn.\n\nThe Skein presents us with a strange puzzle that we must solve. When you saw Ithelia with Vargas in Miscarcand, what exactly did she say?
{{200879108-0-80821:}}Whatever your answer was, it was just one of many that might solve that simple question. I, in turn, might have said gratitude or affection.\n\nIt's important that you learn from my mistakes before attempting to craft your riddle.
{{200879108-0-81207:}}I can't find anything in writing! Which means the orders must've been given verbally. That makes things much more difficult.\n\nBut, someone must have overheard something. Maybe I'll get lucky and find a cultist who's willing to talk.
{{200879108-0-79939:}}What I want is immaterial. The Luminaries will dictate your future as a scriber of grimoires, an editor of spells.\n\nThat said, I am Ulfsild's familiar. I can guide your early steps. Get you flying in the right direction. Where you perch is up to you.
{{200879108-0-79938:}}A guild … of Mages? Fascinating. But a topic for another conversation.\n\nLet's stay focused. Ulfsild prepared for the day that someone would follow in her footsteps. She left behind resources, notes and information for her eventual inheritor.
{{200879108-0-79934:}}Here. I'm a bit out of practice, so see if you can open the lockbox with this.
{{200879108-0-79937:}}The Recollection is a group of Wood Elf cultists. The Ayleid were their ancestors, or so they believe, and so they seek out treasures of the past.\n\nI heard they may also be trying to conquer West Weald, but I attempt to avoid politics when I can.
{{200879108-0-79931:}}I owe Tham. Probably more than I can ever repay. And the people of Sutch. It's because of me that the town was overrun by Balandrus and his gang of vampires. I need to try to help them all recover … to find a way to carry on with their lives.
{{200879108-0-79933:}}Pick the lock? Sure, if you have a lot of time and the right tools. It's a bank vault, not the door to Farmer Dalph's pantry.\n\nJust look for the key. She kept it in a lockbox right by the clerk's desk.
{{200879108-0-79932:}}Look, I made a career of knowing how to get in and out of places where valuables are kept. And I got friendly with the bank's clerk. She couldn't see very well and was always misplacing things, so the banker let her keep a spare key for emergencies.
{{200879108-0-81309:}}The vampires took Tham and the other townsfolk into the mines. I'm certain that's where Balandrus has his headquarters. Or do vampires call it a lair? But you can't go down there! They'll tear you apart! \n\nPlease, let me go. My family needs me.
{{200879108-0-81307:}}All I want to do is drink myself into Oblivion as fast as I can. But I am not going to take that way out. Not today. Val deserves better from me.\n\nThanks for helping, stranger. Things would have gone worse without you.
{{200879108-0-81499:}}That's … wow. That's a long way from here. \n\nIf you're up for it, how about I create a portal for us and come along? I can open the way for you if the trail leads somewhere else.
{{200879108-0-81490:}}The circumstance of my existence is … strange, to say the least. But my power, my strength, is a gift. From Magnus, from Aetherius, choose as you will.\n\nThat is a gift that I could honor. Or I could squander. I choose the path of honor.
{{200879108-0-81493:}}I believe it is what we choose to do that defines us, not where or how we are born.\n\nWhen I see cruelty against the weak, when I know my gifts can make a difference, I step in. How could I not?
{{200879108-0-79069:}}Capable? Yes, I suppose she is. Knows the old runes, and a double fistful of languages. And she keeps my notes in order and handles the accounts. But still, she needs a firm, commanding mind to give her direction.
{{200879108-0-79068:}}Yes, I'm confused by that as well. Greenspeakers are mages who work within the Green Pact to shape the forest to meet their needs. Every Wood Elf village has a greenspeaker to grow new pod-homes or shape useful tools.\n\nIt's an art my people cherish.
{{200879108-0-79067:}}Since the appearance of the new forest, what the Bosmer of Vashabar call Dawnwood, the rest of West Weald has grown nervous and suspicious of all Wood Elves. I've lived here for years, but suddenly I'm an outsider.\n\nThings could get ugly.
{{200879108-0-79066:}}I know, it's too much. During my adventuring days, I helped a wealthy Colovian family. They rewarded me with the deed to a grand old empty townhouse. I had enough gold to make this place livable and … it seemed a waste not to use it.
{{200879108-0-79064:}}Not at all. But some of their beliefs match my own. All that aside, I wanted to show Beragon what I found. A new type of seed. It's similar to what we greenspeakers use to grow and shape tree villages, but different. It thrums with unique potential.
{{200879108-0-81666:}}In addition to being a greenspeaker, I study Ayleids and the history of the Wild Elves for the University of Gwylim. The nearby ruins called out to me the moment I noticed them. And what I discovered … no, no, you really must see it.
{{200879108-0-78810:}}If you want to hit them head-on, I'll follow your lead and help as I can. But there might be an easier way to get where we need to go.\n\nBefore we commit to an attack, why don't we scout the perimeter and see what other options present themselves?
{{200879108-0-78819:}}I'll take the Skein of Secrets home and study it. Leramil thinks it's important, and King Nantharion didn't want us to get it. Whatever he's planning, I bet the Skein can help us stop him.\n\nI'll meet you back in Skingrad, friend.
{{200879108-0-81660:}}Not while the power of the Loom and the energy I took from Hermaeus Mora flows through me.\n\nI must shed this power once and for all. Only then can the growing madness be quelled.
{{200879108-0-79798:}}Sunnamere? We're in Summerset, deep under the Mages Guild in Sunhold. \n\nThere's a few ways inside, so the guild has us patrol every so often. Just to make sure no cultists or tome-thieves got in.
{{200879108-0-80700:}}A fantastic idea. Maybe it's transcribed somewhere. Let me ask around and see what I can find.\n\nIn the meantime, you should talk to the Crow. Ulfsild crafted an impossible riddle too, didn't she? I bet the Crow could tell you how she managed hers.
{{200879108-0-79791:}}The runes above the arch and the runes revealed on the mirrors by the Lamp of Clarity are the same. Perhaps activating the mirrors in a specific order is how we can revive the dormant portal and get inside.
{{200879108-0-80348:}}Thief, highwayman, brigand, outlaw—I'd be richer than Count Calantius if I had a gold piece for every name they gave us. That's not who the Scarlets are anymore.\n\nOnce we were legionaries. Good ones, even.
{{200879108-0-81318:}}He certainly thought so. Expected to be made a sergeant just because I had him performing those duties for the squad.\n\nFor all I know, Ulrath was in league with these Daedra. It wouldn't surprise me. He's a tough, nasty Orc who hates taking orders.
{{200879108-0-81315:}}I'm not a greenspeaker or a spinner, but I know a corrupted seed when I see one. If we can trace it to its source, I think we can find the Recollection.\n\nLuckily, there are experts on this sort of thing close by. In the Wood Elf town of Vashabar.
{{200879108-0-79308:}}Good. And we have enough evidence to implicate them, not only in the deaths of Healer Nevama and my father, but in the deaths of all those workers.\n\nTheir alchemist created an elixir that made the workers more productive, but at a terrible cost.
{{200879108-0-79304:}}Exactly. Perhaps that indicates the distance and direction to be moved? Regardless, I entrust this solution to you. I'll be here detailing the epitaph and these tiles for my notes. Hurry now, assistant! Surely you can handle this!
{{200879108-0-79691:}}Such is the nature of metaphysical debate. Perhaps the Daedra delight in confusing us, and we empower them when we think of them. I wonder, when we sleep at night, do they weaken, since we don't consider them?
{{200879108-0-81314:}}Dawnwood is what we call this new forest. Valenwood lies to the south, just across the Strid River. King Nantharion gathered Bosmer who wanted a fresh start and took advantage of the new forest to build the Vashabar settlement.
{{200879108-0-80531:}}The reasons are unfathomable to the limitations of your mortal mind, but I'll try to explain. Through the machinations of Torvesard and Vargas, and the presence of Ithelia, the tears at these specific locations resonate throughout the realms.
{{200879108-0-80530:}}Exactly! Remember, the relics were created specifically to thwart Ithelia's power. The energy they contain, once released by the casting of the spell, should restore the fabric of reality, keeping it from unraveling and repairing it.\n\nIn theory.
{{200879108-0-80532:}}Despite our vast differences, we do share one trait—curiosity. Very well, ask your questions. And pray that my answers do not shatter your mortal mind.
{{200879108-0-80535:}}I am Ur-Daedra, the One Who Knows. I see infinite possibilities arrayed before me but not necessarily the final path.\n\nIn you I saw potential, but I could not determine how that potential would be realized. That is your power, mortal. Use it wisely.
{{200879108-0-80537:}}No. Even if you try to remind them, they will not remember Ithelia. They cannot remember.\n\nYou have proven yourself capable and worthy of my confidence. You, and you alone, shall remember.
{{200879108-0-80536:}}Mirrormoor and its denizens shall be known from this point forth, but who they were and who they served will remain a mystery. Now they are masterless, their plane a shattered ruin.\n\nAny that remain in your world will be dealt with or depart in time.
{{200879108-0-78622:}}The dog has a penchant for stealing what isn't his. I usually ask our gardener to wrangle him, but, as you can see, he hasn't done a very good job. Of course, now that Lady Weatherleah has passed, we can consider alternatives.
{{200879108-0-78623:}}Yes. I had taken over kitchen duties while Edric was away. I was restocking the pantry after returning from the market when I heard a loud crashing noise from the library.
{{200879108-0-78620:}}Otho Florious, the gardener, was the one who found her. He was the only one home at the time. Ever since I fired that horrible cook, Otho's been the only remaining staff member tending to the estate.
{{200879108-0-81054:}}That's good, but I don't think this one wants to be found. It's my fear—the same facet you saw earlier. She probably ran to the deepest place she could find to hide.\n\nI sense she's in a cave or ruin southwest of Ontus.
{{200879108-0-78621:}}Well enough. He's known me since my courtship years with Uriel. He causes his fair share of mischief, but Lady Weatherleah could never bring herself to get rid of him. After all, Betu was her last connection to Uriel.
{{200879108-0-78625:}}I thought Betu might've knocked something over in the library, but when I went to check, the door was blocked by something heavy. By the time I wedged myself through it was too late.
{{200879108-0-81057:}}I watched our little village grow from a few tents to actual structures. It was a beautiful place. Then the forest suddenly grew up around us. Trees and vegetation bursting through the paved streets and displacing buildings. We fled in terror!
{{200879108-0-79250:}}I don't mean to disparage them. I believe a few are trying their best, but many of them lack the Imperial instinct for combat. The Redguards, for example, have their own combat techniques that clash with our martial traditions.
{{200879108-0-81056:}}Bella has fanciful ideas about heroism. She thinks people like you or Pim are the greatest folks in Tamriel. I'm worried she went off to try to test her own mettle.\n\nI just hope she'll come home before Jerntann and the hunters begin.
{{200879108-0-80881:}}Hermorah asked the scribes to secure the arcane knot. Mazandi and Zilipif do not need this one's advice anymore and the other scribes have their own duties to see to.\n\nIt made the most sense for Keshargo to come.
{{200879108-0-80880:}}The scribes normally take a position of passive observation, but this is a special expedition. \n\nThe Prince of Fate and Knowledge tasked this one with the knot's retrieval. If Hermorah wants the knot safely sealed, this one will do it.
{{200879108-0-80888:}}Greenspeakers, including Laeni's father, grew the village after Dawnwood covered the land. Vashabar's still a tender shoot, by Valenwood standards, but it's expanding every day. \n\nFrom the smallest sprigs, graht-oaks grow.
{{200879108-0-82025:}}Greenspring seeds are what greensingers use to grow new sections of forest and shape them into enclosures and settlements. We used some to create Vashabar. But this one is corrupted. Still, something familiar—wait. I've sensed this before.
{{200879108-0-79786:}}You and Tribune Alea showed us what's possible when we accept a little help. We can't give back what Nantharion has taken, but we can promise to be good neighbors going forward. And we will not advance beyond Dawnwood.\n\nThat is all we need.
{{200879108-0-79785:}}Well, no. You also need to cast a spell to release each relic's energy and send it flowing into the fabric of reality. Here's the spell scroll.\n\nAnd you'll need help, so I'll send one of us to each location to assist you.
{{200879108-0-79781:}}I spend a lot of coin to buy land. And with that land, I secure a treaty of cooperation with our new neighbors.\n\nI thank you, hero. You aided West Weald in our time of need. Wherever your journey leads next, Skingrad is forever in your debt.
{{200879108-0-78762:}}Not everything. Everyone will remember that the mortal realm was threatened and that you saved them. What they will not remember is Ithelia. Mirrormoor will be one more abandoned Oblivion plane, and the name Ithelia will mean nothing.
{{200879108-0-78761:}}Ithelia, the Prince of Paths, has been exiled from this reality, never to return. Now I must once more remove her from memory. For the sake of existence, she must once more be forgotten.
{{200879108-0-81784:}}Once Torvesard forced us all to remember, history changed. That's not something we're just going to forget. It will be interesting to see the ramifications of a new Daedric Prince, even if she's no longer here.\n\nIt will change our views of the past.
{{200879108-0-81912:}}I don't assume so. I sense no hostile intent from you. Members of House Ravenwatch stick to a strict code of conduct, as prescribed by our leader, Count Verandis. We take no blood by force, help those in need, and seek to contain hostile vampires.
{{200879108-0-78840:}}How else did they know to set this ambush? Greenspeaker Darolith wouldn't have betrayed us, so it must be someone close to King Nantharion. Which means Nantharion's got a knife to his throat and he doesn't know it.\n\nWe've got to tell him.
{{200879108-0-81467:}}Perhaps a few bottles were carried off, but none of them had time to load any casks or crates before they fled. I'll track them down eventually.\n\nAnd before I take my leave, I'll make sure the remaining vintage is destroyed.
{{200879108-0-81874:}}If the Luminaries share one trait, it's a love of a challenge overcome. Yes, you'll need to gather three key fragments to open the Indrik's door. \n\nLet's begin. And remember, if you lose your sight, there will always be more focal points at hand.
{{200879108-0-81919:}}You mean besides the fact that it was addressed to a dangerous vampire and supposedly invited them to an auction they have absolutely no reason to be interested in?\n\nWhen things appear to make no sense, I feel obliged to find clarity.
{{200879108-0-81463:}}Yes. I misjudged her, badly, regarding the Stonefire Cult. I am glad to see that there are valiant heroes in the world who can deal with such treachery.
{{200879108-0-79539:}}With their fathers hunting for them, I told Laeni and Clen to hide out. They have a little love nest in an overgrown ruin on the southern edge of town. I bet they're there.\n\nTell them what you found. Vashabar will be waiting when you return.
{{200879108-0-79536:}}Leave this reality for a realm where she would have no access to her Daedric power? I had not considered that.\n\nI would need to confirm that the reality guarantees our safety, but how will we make certain that she would indeed be exiled forever?
{{200879108-0-81469:}}Ah, there was a truly boundless soul! Ulfsild was a most bubbly companion. Joyous. Ebullient. Witty. \n\nShe was clever and taught me many things. Very netchy. I wonder if she had some netch ancestry?
{{200879108-0-81899:}}That was Ulfsild's choice. She spoke to other scholars of her time. Her husband, her friends. But Scribing was a path she walked alone. \n\nIt was a choice I believe she came to regret, in the end.
{{200879108-0-81891:}}Gladiators in a ring. The unquiet dead, a Daedric incursion. Overlords reigning in the depths. They all possess the means to destroy, to control. \n\nI encourage you to see that power firsthand. And consider how you, yourself, would use it.
{{200879108-0-81890:}}Why are you the way that you are? Why do you have smooth skin, two eyes, and walk upon two legs? You are what you were born to be, and I am the same. \n\nI was able to choose my shape, but there was no other shape I could have been.
{{200879108-0-81893:}}Why are you the way that you are? Why do you have scales, a forked tongue, and a tail? You are what you were born to be, and I am the same. \n\nI was able to choose my shape, but there was no other shape I could have been.
{{200879108-0-81892:}}Why are you the way that you are? Why do you have fur, claws, and a tail? You are what you were born to be, and I am the same. \n\nI was able to choose my shape, but there was no other shape I could have been.
{{200879108-0-81894:}}The old-fashioned way—loyalty, dedication, and a strong sword arm. I saw battle in Varen's Rebellion, then defended Colovia when the usurper war began.\n\nOur victory at the Battle for North Hook started my rise up the ranks. Now here I am.
{{200879108-0-81896:}}I tried to convince Count Calantius to assign more legionaries to guard Rustwall, but as the Legion is already stretched thin, he was only willing to send periodic patrols.\n\nSince then, I've been looking into the Recollection and their Daedra allies.
{{200879108-0-80428:}}Aye. When the Longhouse Emperor was defeated at Solitude, he punished legionaries who dared to come home alive. We deserted to escape the noose. That made us outlaws.
{{200879108-0-80768:}}I want them to be happy, sap sweet as that is. They've put off their own plans for years now, first supporting their fathers and then the village.\n\nIf they want to stand and be married, Y'ffre himself couldn't dissuade me.
{{200879108-0-80769:}}Since we were kids I've been trying to get Nedolir to listen to reason. He may be a pillar of the community now, but to me he'll always be my little brother.\n\nHe thinks he's teasing me by calling me a wise woman. But I secretly love it.
{{200879108-0-80767:}}Of course. You're kind to involve yourself in affairs of the heart like this. \n\nFamily, tradition, belief. And my brother. What a mess.
{{200879108-0-79889:}}I suppose if you meant true harm you could have done much worse. We'll need a new crystal to act as a focus for the altar.\n\nProcure one, and … pinfeathers. I suppose it's the only way. We'll have to try.
{{200879108-0-79888:}}You may call me the Crow. This is the Scholarium and … I see now. She didn't send you. \n\nIf she had, your knight wouldn't have smashed the altar's focusing crystal!
{{200879108-0-81548:}}I thought about finding Nantharion, but nothing happened. Then I remembered that these relics were made to find and defeat Ithelia. So I thought about her and these Daedric runes appeared. I think they translate as the Staff of Many Paths.
{{200879108-0-82175:}}I did, and she was a bit cryptic. I mean, especially cryptic. Sometimes it's hard to tell with a magical talking crow, but she seemed like she didn't want to talk about it.
{{200879108-0-79823:}}Many Ayleids worshiped Daedric Princes. Ithelia may have been among them. When the Recollection began to remember Ithelia, they remembered her as their god. I think they are searching for shrines to Ithelia.\n\nMere speculation, but a logical guess.
{{200879108-0-81461:}}It enjoys being the center of attention, its tendrils ever reaching for ever more. Ruffles my feathers a bit.\n\nIts actions will seem enigmatic, even esoteric. But it really does mean well. I think.
{{200879108-0-81468:}}A lot of hard work, I imagine. I must retain as many of the competent and knowledgeable vineyard workers as I can. Then we need to destroy any lingering evidence of my husband's experiments.\n\nAfter that, we can start producing delicious wine again.
{{200879108-0-78875:}}Scruut said that the ship was overloaded with amulets, statuettes, and other Mephala paraphernalia, but we're looking for bolts of silk cloth spun by devout worshipers of the Lady of Whispers. The ship was lost at sea and wound up here.
{{200879108-0-81367:}}You said it. Scribing, the Scholarium, it was her life's work. If I can help keep it going, maybe even bring it to others through the Guild ….\n\nI can think about that later. Let's get the sigil back to the altar. Finish what we started.
{{200879108-0-78892:}}I would have kept the curse if it would have meant saving the people of Sutch.\n\nNow, there's barely anyone left. All I can do is make sure Balandrus meets his end. Even if it means my end as well.
{{200879108-0-79766:}}Who? Is that someone we met along the way? Sorry, I have no memory of … what name did you say again?\n\nAnyway, I can't believe Beragon threw a party! We didn't have many of those back at the Necropolis.
{{200879108-0-78560:}}Yes, terribly so. I've been in her employ for what feels like ages. Which is why I hope you'll listen when I say you must leave the estate. I fear what happened to our dear lady could happen to you!
{{200879108-0-78562:}}Chefs are privy to more than just their employer's favorite dishes. Lady Weatherleah hasn't been the same since her son's disappearance and I am not the only one to take notice. Fruit flies buzz around the sweetest fruit after all.
{{200879108-0-78565:}}Yes, of course! Along with the cook there's Otho Florius, the gardener. Then of course, Lady Weatherleah's missing son himself, Uriel, back from the dead. And his wife, Pelena, who has long lived at the estate with Lady Weatherleah.
{{200879108-0-78564:}}I can't say any more. I only came to pay my respects and to leave this place behind. If I were you, I would stay far away from that manor before that investigator digs up something horrible.
{{200879108-0-78567:}}Convenient, yes? Many questions surround Uriel's sudden return. And it should be noted that Pelena seems none too pleased about it. Mizzik has of course investigated a number of failed marriages, but this seems different.\n\nAh, what of the will?
{{200879108-0-78569:}}If you mess up, the Aetherial energy overcycles and rends your soul from your body, then traps your energy inside the shard itself. I'm kidding. It doesn't do that. Probably. You just have to start over. Isn't research fun?\n\nReady to try?
{{200879108-0-78568:}}Right. Activate the alarum at a locked Aetherial shard. That'll trigger the untethering process. \n\nThe crystal pylons surrounding the shard should emit a pattern, so pay attention when that happens. That pattern is the key to unlocking the shard.
{{200879108-0-80179:}}Niryastare was too dangerous for the band I was with. In addition to traps, the Ayleid ruin was full of undead guardians! But the worst obstacles were the collapsed passages and buried doors.\n\nThe Recollection won't get far without a lot of digging.
{{200879108-0-79091:}}Yes, our masquerading rogue. The cook was certain that he was an imposter, but what about the others? Aquilia has her suspicions, but shouldn't Pelena have known? Why hasn't she raised alarm bells and told the others?
{{200879108-0-78360:}}The Reach diplomat claims the clans cannot rest until the trinkets are returned to them and certain rites are performed. It's all beyond me, but Count Calantius says we can't risk angering the Despot of Markarth. We have enough problems as it is.
{{200879108-0-81008:}}I suppose so. If she's lost control of her power, then she needs someone to stabilize her. It seems she chose you for this task.\n\nThe more information you have then, the better.
{{200879108-0-81758:}}Daedra? That's not good.\n\nNow it's even more imperative I figure out exactly who the Recollection is and what their goals are. Maybe we can learn something in these ruins.
{{200879108-0-81759:}}So goes the tale! Akatosh answered her visions. The demigod Morihaus and the hero Pelinal Whitestrake joined her cause. \n\nTogether they tore down the Daedric shrines of the Elves and founded the great Empire of Cyrodiil.
{{200879108-0-81753:}}Legionary Larisus and I were sent to scout. Try to get eyes on the enemy. We were on our way back when the Daedra attacked.\n\nI'm sure glad you were operating the ballista. Not sure if any of the legionaries could have cleared the field like you did.
{{200879108-0-81750:}}Exactly! If the Dragon says you're Ulfsild's inheritor she answered your riddle. But you never claimed to be. Which, from what Ulfsild told the Dragon, means you are. \n\nIt's a loop the Dragon could run forever, the kind of puzzle she loves.
{{200879108-0-81751:}}Yes, just so. Perhaps … perhaps … my daughter's union with Clendagal might build a bridge across that divide.\n\nAnd you know, deep down, our two beliefs aren't all that different. Not really.
{{200879108-0-81754:}}Just that it's what the Wood Elves of Vashabar call the narrow band of devastation that runs along the northern edge of the new forest. It separates the rest of West Weald from Dawnwood.\n\nI'm not sure what a wildburn seed is, but I plan to find out.
{{200879108-0-80809:}}I'll try to tell him everything. My time as a historian, meeting my wife Melvina. Everything. I'm just so relieved to hear his voice again.\n\nYou and Nahlia have given me a memory to last the rest of my life. Thank you, stranger.
{{200879108-0-79887:}}And I have questions for you, it's been so long since I've spoken to someone like this.\n\nI'll spare you my interrogation. I'll learn more about you as you follow the path of the Luminaries.
{{200879108-0-80800:}}It's an ancient Wood Elf custom, handed down from Y'ffre himself. We protect the Green, and in return, it provides for us. There's more to it, but that's the gist.
{{200879108-0-80803:}}I don't know. Probably not in the village itself. Aren't there caves everywhere?\n\nYou're headed there anyway. Maybe find a viewpoint and have a look around?
{{200879108-0-80802:}}I agree with whatever is best for the Dominion. Let each clan choose the path that suits them. This bickering is a distraction from real problems!\n\nBut, I shouldn't be telling you this. I'm supposed to be recruiting right now.
{{200879108-0-80805:}}I sensed the disturbance as I conducted my own investigations. When I heard you had also seen a memory of Ithelia associated with this place, I knew we had to learn more.\n\nUnfortunately, my ability to sense the disturbance also holds me at bay.
{{200879108-0-80804:}}Existence? You speak of it as though it were sacrosanct. But my Prince was locked away and erased from existence by your smug and sanctimonious patron. Forgotten by all. I fixed that, but when we tried to restore our realm, our home, you opposed us.
{{200879108-0-80807:}}No different from what Mora and the other Princes did in that distant millennium. Think of what could have been accomplished had not the Prince of Paths been vanquished from history!\n\nDo you not see? Just stand aside and let events flow as they may.
{{200879108-0-80806:}}As I feared. Hermaeus Mora sees so much but has blinded you. I respect you, mortal. Do what you must and I shall do the same.\n\nPerhaps when reality has been rewritten and a new Mirrormoor arises, you will have a different opinion.
{{200879108-0-79101:}}For now. Watch yourself out in the wilds, though. Things are dicier than they used to be out there.\n\nAnd I hear that Rustwall Estate has a lot more eyes on it these days than when I got here. I may love risk, but I love living more.
{{200879108-0-79098:}}Placidia Menanius. Remember that name. Keeps treasures all about her home not far from here. Doesn't seem to care if any go missing. Friendly cat, too.\n\nWatch out if you enter Miles Talanian's home. Warrior born and bred. Lusty, too.
{{200879108-0-80932:}}Your cleverness almost reaches that of Ulfsild, Not-Ulfsild. His soul has splintered into three parts. While my tendrils can hold him here for a time, a dark spirit seeks to claim him.\n\nThat is why we must move quickly. With the help of your knight.
{{200879108-0-81678:}}A templar and priestess of the Eight. A soul on pilgrimage, carrying the light of hope. \n\nI also indulge in the Tales of Tribute game. Julianos has gifted me with skill in card design and play. Dare you to face my Saint Alessia deck?
{{200879108-0-81887:}}What confidence. You believe you have the wisdom to use my power? The power to maim or mend? To blast with flame or freeze with ice?\n\nWe shall see. First, my door must open once again. Place the fable you carry with you upon the dais.
{{200879108-0-78729:}}Well, that will help me narrow it down. \n\nNo one's allowed to just attack an entire camp and get away with it! I know not everyone approves of logging, but the Weald needs lumber!
{{200879108-0-80069:}}I stepped in. I imbued the fawn with a wisp of my power. But in acting with haste, I acted unwisely. \n\nMy power protected the fawn, true enough, but it gathered the hunter in its wake. Now predator and prey are trapped in a chase unending.
{{200879108-0-80068:}}Instabilities! Places where the threads of fate fray and shred. And it's getting worse! I sense one forming in West Weald even now. But this one feels … different.\n\nAddressing anomalies of fate is my sacred duty, but these scare even me!
{{200879108-0-80287:}}Gather your feathers about you. Nearby you will see a focal point and the Fable of the Indrik. Read the book, then step into the focal point. \n\nPeer through the lens, and you'll see the tome in an all-new light.
{{200879108-0-78994:}}Rustwall Estate is an old Colovian manor to the southeast, on the outskirts of Skingrad. Why Rustwall is important, I cannot say. Yet the threads of fate have been disturbed there and we need to determine the cause.
{{200879108-0-78995:}}Elenglynn is a substantial Ayleid ruin that lies north of Skingrad. A lonely and peaceful spot, or so I have been told. Yet the threads of fate simply vanish in the vicinity, a phenomenon I have never observed before.\n\nWe must determine why.
{{200879108-0-80284:}}Perhaps that's for the best. That ale, well, it packs a wallop.
{{200879108-0-78997:}}No, no. The only way Beragon can understand this discovery is by experiencing it himself.\n\nHow about we all see it together? It's down in the Ayleid ruins nearby. I'll show you both. It truly is remarkable.
{{200879108-0-80980:}}Of course you do. Let's get on with it, then. \n\nI'd rather not drag this out any longer than I have to, although at least my despair isn't likely to run anytime soon. I tend to wallow when the mood strikes.
{{200879108-0-80065:}}See, I needn't explain anything to you! You're well-informed. I needed bodies willing to dive into an Ayleid ruin regardless of danger, and the Recollection was available and remarkably easy to convince.\n\nUntil they turned on me.
{{200879108-0-80983:}}Honestly, I'm not sure. Talk to them, for a start.\n\nI can be quite stubborn, so I expect my facets won't come easily. Do whatever it takes to convince them to return. Appease them. Bargain with them. Tie them up for all I care, just get them back.
{{200879108-0-80987:}}Speak to the Fox, mortal. This was his clever idea, and he will be your guide. In the meantime I will make preparations. \n\nIt has been some time since these talons did delicate spellwork.
{{200879108-0-81580:}}I've become pretty good at sneaking around down here. There are all sorts of secret passageways and trick walls. You just have to know where to look.\n\nDon't wait for me, though. I have to move slow to avoid the Recollection patrols and the Daedra.
{{200879108-0-81586:}}Let's get through this party first and let the village sober up. A few days, I expect—at most!\n\nThat will give our fathers time to become comfortable with the idea. And I can work with Ciiril to arrange the handfast ceremony.
{{200879108-0-80755:}}What a delicious trick, returning his father just in time! Grief is heavy. Not good for floating. Regret, that's even worse. \n\nElic and his father were trapped beneath all that weight. And now they are both just a little lighter.
{{200879108-0-80276:}}When you have been at this as long as I have, you develop a sixth sense for these things. Place all three items on the altar, but we will use the sacred water. Trust me.
{{200879108-0-80752:}}Growing up, he was all I had. Mother passed when I was young. We regretted what we said to each other, but the years got away from us.\n\nWhat do I do? How can I make up for all these years we've missed together?
{{200879108-0-78759:}}I admit that all I have is speculation and logical deduction. Nantharion, as the secret leader of the Recollection, used a corrupted seed—called a wildburn seed—to transform a portion of West Weald into Dawnwood. I think he's planting more seeds.
{{200879108-0-78750:}}<<1>> constantly complains that we never take a vacation. So, when the opportunity presented itself, I set up this trip to visit West Weald.\n\nHe was certainly surprised, but I get the feeling he was hoping for somewhere with a bit less jungle.
{{200879108-0-78751:}}We met on one of my construction sites. I was just an assistant on that project and <<1>> was one of our stone masons. He's really good at his craft.\n\nWhenever he gets the chance, he loves to learn new techniques for working stone.
{{200879108-0-78756:}}Hmm. The one to the north might be Terthil Farm. It's a remote homestead. The other one looks like Hastrel Hollow. There's a ruined tower nearby.\n\nYou should travel to each one and investigate. If you find any wildburn seeds, destroy them.
{{200879108-0-78757:}}While you search the sites, I'll see what else I can get the Skein to reveal to me. And I'll try to make more sense of the other relics.\n\nCome back when you're done investigating the sites. Between the two of us, we're bound to find something.
{{200879108-0-78754:}}Most certainly! But Leramil, Tribune Alea, Scruut, Curate Gadayn, and I probably wouldn't have accomplished what we did without you as our anchor point.\n\nAnd poor Gadayn. I know he was a good friend to you and Leramil.
{{200879108-0-78755:}}There was a lot more to it! The exact relics had to be placed precisely, and a spell provided by a Daedric Prince had to be cast perfectly at each location.\n\nWhile it will take reality some time to totally recover, existence is no longer in peril.
{{200879108-0-79808:}}They hated our match long before we crossed the river Strid and Vashabar was grown. But the last few months have been tense to the point of breaking.\n\nWe tried one last blighted time to convince them, as you saw. And failed spectacularly, damn it.
{{200879108-0-79800:}}Right, introductions. Tribune Alea Idolus of the Imperial Legion, marshal to Count Calantius of Skingrad, daughter of Quatrius Idolus. And so on and so forth.\n\nDon't worry about the titles. Just consider me a regular soldier with an impressive rank.
{{200879108-0-79805:}}It's our newly grown home. We're a clan of Wood Elves, originally from Valenwood. We follow the Green Pact, but a number of us support the Dawnway as well.\n\nWe crossed the river Strid when the forest of Valenwood extended into West Weald.
{{200879108-0-81655:}}The finest wielders of nature magic in Tamriel. Greenspeakers wiggle their fingers and a tree bends its shape into a home. They make it possible for Wood Elves to construct cities without harming the forest.
{{200879108-0-82108:}}Hah, you've got it. You can paint a picture with many different brushes, many different colors, can you not? \n\nScribing allows a talented hand to do the same with magic. Crafting a spell or skill in just the artistic fashion you want.
{{200879108-0-82109:}}My pocket domain, shaped and hewn into being in the same way I chose my form. \n\nI find it a pleasant respite from the larger world. Other Luminary domains may have been formed with … different goals.
{{200879108-0-82106:}}Yes, that's a good way to look at it. Grimoires are spells and skills built from the ground up with artistry. No one would claim they're the most efficient, most reliable workings.\n\nBut they're far more flexible than the average magecraft.
{{200879108-0-82107:}}In so many ways. Scribing hinges upon the borrowed power of the Luminaries channeled through the altar. \n\nWith their power flowing to the focus at the heart of the Scholarium a mage is able to do incredible, ineffable acts of creation.
{{200879108-0-82104:}}Ulfsild's innate gift to see magicka brought with it a lifetime of lived experiences not easily transferred to others. \n\nSo she developed the art of shaping magic via ink, parchment, and quill. What was missing was raw mystical strength.
{{200879108-0-82103:}}Most spells and skills are time-honored traditions. Reliable, consistent. But they lack artistry, require nothing from the caster beyond a basic understanding of how magicka flows.\n\nI described Scribing as an art because it requires artistry.
{{200879108-0-82100:}}Like a flock moving across the sky, Scribing twists and turns in the wind. It was an art form, a discipline, and a life's work. \n\nAnd as she got to know the Luminaries it became a collaboration with her very best friends.
{{200879108-0-81577:}}I'd bet my sword that she set up a portal like the one in Feldagard's armory. A quiet incursion under Rustwall is the perfect way to gather an army. And right on Skingrad's doorstep! They could overwhelm the city before the first alarm sounded.
{{200879108-0-81574:}}Regomor had Noraine while I was still in prison. They settled here in Vashabar shortly after King Nantharion put out the call for Wood Elves to join him in building a new homeland for our people.
{{200879108-0-81575:}}I think Regomor's judgment is clouded. Uprooting a child from the life they know isn't easy. But I have no right to tell Regomor how to raise his daughter. Not after what I did to him.
{{200879108-0-81570:}}At first it was only to survive. Pickpocketing and petty theft was too small a gain for the risk. Then things just continued to grow. I'm ashamed to say I found it fun. Prison cured me of that, but it was already too late.
{{200879108-0-81785:}}Right. And we're certain she's really gone? That she can't find a way back and start all this trouble again?\n\nWhat am I saying? Of course we are. Even Hermaeus Mora said so! Still ….
{{200879108-0-80180:}}They seek to restore their patron, the once-forgotten Daedric Prince Ithelia, to her rightful place of power. But Ithelia isn't quite herself since escaping from Hermaeus Mora's prison.
{{200879108-0-80189:}}I've seen a few Recollection scouts come and go while I've been watching, but I haven't seen any of their leaders. Of course, I have no idea what's waiting for us in the underground portions of the ruins.
{{200879108-0-79279:}}Ah, yes! I remember you! Still looking for honest work, I see! No matter, I am glad to take you under my wing once more in this endeavor!
{{200879108-0-78303:}}Yes, but I'm not sure I understood it all. Apparently, you have a map that's also a Daedric relic? Scruut says you need to get it to something immersed in the energy of Mephala. That will restore its power.\n\nHave … have you seen Leramil recently?
{{200879108-0-78654:}}He did, did he? I knew the lad was brave and had something to prove, but this is beyond the call of duty for a raw recruit. If he survives until the reinforcements get here, I may just have to promote him.\n\nBut why do you think he did it?
{{200879108-0-80405:}}I'll need some time to make arrangements in case I don't come back. But I'll be there. For the others, and for my family. I promise.
{{200879108-0-80400:}}A spyglass? They were watching me—and my family. A family I barely even know myself. I should have known someone with a past like mine doesn't get to retire and watch their grandchildren grow up.
{{200879108-0-80402:}}I have to. If something happened to my family on my account, I couldn't live with it. I have to face my past: the years in prison, Caelum Vineyard, the fire. All of it.\n\nBut I haven't even spoken to Hooke since … never mind.
{{200879108-0-80409:}}There are a few souls down here who owe me favors. They keep their ears to the ground. If anyone hears a whisper about this murderer, we'll know.\n\nIn the meantime, I have another job for you. There's a Scarlet I need you to chase down.
{{200879108-0-80408:}}This? This is a walk in the park. A stroll through the meadows. I've diced with Daedra and fled before undead hordes. There's nothing here we can't handle. And by we, I mean you.
{{200879108-0-81446:}}Be good at what you do, my mother always used to say. Even if it's not your calling.\n\nHang on, I didn't think about Ulfsild's lens. Maybe the book's hidden in there and you're the only one who could see it. I bet that's it, go find out!
{{200879108-0-81442:}}I won't lie. I came here to kill him. For Almo and Regnir, for Naku, to protect Val and the others. But now, I just want to find some sort of peace with what happened. Maybe there's still a chance for that.\n\nCome on. Let's find an entrance.
{{200879108-0-80173:}}An attack on the fortress by Recollection forces sounds pretty urgent. But if Leramil thinks you're needed somewhere, that's probably important, too.\n\nSince you can't be in two places at once, maybe just flip a coin?
{{200879108-0-80568:}}When I think of Ayleids, I think of magic. Welkynd stones, portals, ancient relics. Things that would be dangerous in the wrong hands. But how it fits into Nantharion's plans, I don't know.\n\nThink you could help me piece it together, friend?
{{200879108-0-80564:}}I won't know for sure until I finish deciphering Nantharion's notes. But Ithelia is still at large, the Daedric incursions haven't stopped, and Recollection forces are thick as hoarvors on carrion around Ayleid ruins.\n\nThey're looking for something.
{{200879108-0-80565:}}I follow whatever orders Tribune Alea sees fit to assign to me, thank you very much! But yes, she told me to stay in Skingrad and run messages for you and her allies.
{{200879108-0-79346:}}Torvesard used Abolisher to open the way to Ithelia's prison. He knows the relics can be used to return her there and will do anything to prevent that. These ancient tools may be the keys to saving West Weald. And perhaps all of reality.
{{200879108-0-81136:}}Your vow has been sworn.
{{200879108-0-81137:}}Pinfeathers, mortal. When we first met I didn't know your quality. I spent many years in solitude, guarding and hoping to guide. \n\nNow, here we are. You, a worthy inheritor to Ulfsild's legacy. Me, the proctor in your trial. Are you ready to begin?
{{200879108-0-81134:}}Your vow has been sworn.
{{200879108-0-81132:}}Your vow has been sworn.
{{200879108-0-81130:}}Your vow has been sworn.
{{200879108-0-81131:}}Your vow has been sworn.
{{200879108-0-81138:}}Ulfsild named us Luminaries, magical lights in the darkness. This puzzle asks you to set braziers ablaze in honor of that name.\n\nJust think back to your time with the Dragon. You know everything you need to complete this puzzle. Good luck.
{{200879108-0-81139:}}I shaped my domain to be the perfect trial space, based on Shalidor's Labyrinthian. It will finally prove you are the one I have awaited. Showcase what you have learned in your journey to master Scribing.\n\nWe start here, in the Luminary antechamber.
{{200879108-0-81115:}}I guess that makes sense, since the portal to get here was keyed to two people. \n\nAnd after all, it's my duty as a Knight of the Lamp to follow you into the unknown. To protect you from the dangers therein.
{{200879108-0-81960:}}One can hope. I still can't quite wrap my head around the fact you helped bring Eyevea home. Hah!\n\nIn any case, Ulfsild was just as talented as her husband. Almost every one of her wards is holding. Which makes our interloper all the more confusing.
{{200879108-0-81968:}}Ulfsild's handwriting is on every tome in here, but she wasn't eager to share much of herself with history.\n\nAs for the Gryphon, he seems to come off as a strong personality. But with a bit of an interesting soft spot. That fox she mentioned.
{{200879108-0-81562:}}Why, I'm making some new friends! There's no better way to win people over than a cold drink and a warm toast. And these people really know how to celebrate.\n\nHmm, now I want some toast.
{{200879108-0-80615:}}Echoes from other realities. My power drew them here, trapped them between this path and their own. They are confused, suffering.\n\nUntil I gain control of myself, I cannot set them free.
{{200879108-0-80616:}}Interesting. I'll make a note of that. I've seen other reports of strange beasts in the area, but I assumed they were just exaggerations. Something else to put on our to-do list, I suppose. Thank you for the information.
{{200879108-0-80610:}}Well. That is unfortunate. And it explains why the workers haven't returned the tool packs of their own accord. That makes it even more imperative that you return there and recover the Legion's property.\n\nAnything else you can tell me?
{{200879108-0-81626:}}I am not surprised. Many who travel the planes pass through Fargrave. I do not recognize this quarter of the city, though. Nor can I explain what happened to our allies.\n\nHmm. Perhaps it was some effect of Ithelia's presence?
{{200879108-0-81213:}}You've collected grimoires, scoured the world for scripts, and scribed powerful spells and skills. You have power, inheritor, and I want to see you demonstrate it.
{{200879108-0-81886:}}An honest answer, and wise. I offer the power to maim or mend. To blast with flame or freeze with ice. Such a gift is not taken lightly. \n\nBut first, my door must open once again. Place the fable you carry with you upon the dais.
{{200879108-0-81885:}}A story is never just a story. It has the power to change, from within and without. The Fable of the Indrik acts as a symbolic connection, a commitment from me to you. \n\nPlace the book, and open the path.
{{200879108-0-81880:}}That ruffles the feathers more than I intended. Think of it this way, your average archmage is just a neophyte compared to the Luminaries.\n\nI think these hidden keys are a way to dissuade … let's call them casual questions.
{{200879108-0-81625:}}Heh, it's a family nickname for my aunt Ciiril. Agawen means something like wise woman. I think it's an old joke between her and my father. \n\nIn kinder times, he encouraged us to appreciate our culture and use our language. Pfeh.
{{200879108-0-82071:}}Fantastic. Maybe the part about Mizbi's riddle is transcribed somewhere. Let me ask around and see what I can find.\n\nIn the meantime, you follow up on those notes. Come grab me when you've learned what Ulfsild had to say. This is so exciting!
{{200879108-0-81889:}}That was Ulfsild's choice. She spoke to other scholars of her time. Her husband, her friends. But Scribing was a path she walked alone. \n\nIt was a choice I believe she came to regret, in the end.
{{200879108-0-80688:}}Much like he still is. Always a perfect gentleman. Our first moment alone after our families arranged our engagement, I told him to drop any pretense of romantic interest.\n\nOh, how he blushed! Pity those pale cheeks won't ever blush again.
{{200879108-0-80684:}}Of course! Leave it to Sariyaah to watch out for me even when she's not here.\n\nI meant to send word to her, but that was before the mess with my net and the guzzards. Please, tell Sariyaah I'm sorry. I need to check the other snares before I return.
{{200879108-0-81184:}}I like being un-retired. I think I was getting too comfortable puttering around in this great big house. After our recent adventures together, I'm ready for a few more. Little ones, anyway. And preferably not too dangerous.
{{200879108-0-81182:}}If I managed to get the idea through my thick head, so can they.\n\nWhen we first met, I believed the appearance of Vashabar was one more invasion to fight off. You and Beragon opened my eyes that not everything different is bad. Thanks for that.
{{200879108-0-79424:}}Sounds good!
{{200879108-0-80968:}}This man claims I turned his wife into a pig and escaped my bonds. Thankfully, the guard says her prisoner is still secure, but we're too late to prevent my vanity from lashing out.
{{200879108-0-80969:}}I couldn't agree more. We learned that the Recollection cult is working with Daedra and taking orders from Shardmarshal Vargas. They got damn close to launching an invasion of Skingrad! Would have succeeded, too, if you hadn't happened by.
{{200879108-0-79617:}}Some of those Dawnway idiots decided that I was no longer welcome in Vashabar. Said I followed the Green Pact too zealously. But they only had a problem with me after I gave them a rather unsettling fortune.
{{200879108-0-79610:}}Hmm. I wonder what my father hoped to get out of talking to them. I know this is all tied to fatigue fever, I just don't know how.\n\nWhat about the constable's office? Did you find anything important there?
{{200879108-0-79612:}}My father's notebook? It describes how productivity increased lately at both the quarry and the ranch. Interesting. And he mentions how the town healer died suddenly before she could share her findings.\n\nTwo suspicious deaths that break the pattern.
{{200879108-0-79613:}}Of course! Wisps are gifts from Y'ffre to signal times of change. I can ask my wisps what exactly that change will be.\n\nGive me a moment to convene with them.
{{200879108-0-79619:}}Followers of the Dawnway claim to honor the Green, but honestly most of them are more interested in Ayleids and ancestors twice removed from our Bosmer heritage. At least, that's my opinion.
{{200879108-0-81794:}}It's all in my report. Ever since our first encounter with the Daedra a few weeks ago, she's been … off. Confusing orders. Contradictory commands. When we walked into the ambush, she was like a rabbit in a snare.\n\nI tried to take command ….
{{200879108-0-81795:}}I finally saw our captain's true face. She used to be a great leader. I would have followed her to Oblivion and back. But lately she's been struggling. I helped as I could, doing what a sergeant would do, even without the rank.\n\nThen today happened.
{{200879108-0-81407:}}Heh. Just remember. In your quest to meet other Luminaries, I will not be around to act as a guide.\n\nThe next set of wards lie within the ruins of Ondil. The third are on the eastern island of Buraniim. Ulfsild's annotations make that clear.
{{200879108-0-80738:}}Anything to take the weight off the shoulders. Health, or happiness, or even money. Ulfsild tried to explain money to me. It sounded depressing, but apparently people quite like it.\n\nI have a list of helpful games for you to play.
{{200879108-0-80337:}}How embarrassing. You overheard that? Tensions have been high since his mother's passing. There are certain adjustments we've both had to make. Nothing some restful sleep can't solve.
{{200879108-0-80336:}}Happy doesn't do the feeling justice. Ecstatic, overjoyed, yet still burdened by mother's passing and the horrors of battle. But, being surrounded by loved ones has been a major boon.
{{200879108-0-80335:}}Closer than most staff are with their lords and ladies I reckon. I'd worked for her since before young Uriel had even been born. Feels like a lifetime ago. More memories to drown I suppose.
{{200879108-0-80334:}}Edric is making a bit of a fool of himself. It pains me to see him this way. I assure you, he's never acted like this before. Perhaps it'd be better if you asked him. He's had a rough go of it.
{{200879108-0-80489:}}Other than the Wood Elves I spotted sneaking around, we never saw the enemy. And the only evidence of foul play was the bloody armor I found.\n\nCaptain Leronus assumed it was brigands looking to rob the estate, but would brigands challenge a cohort?
{{200879108-0-80488:}}Before her death, Lady Weatherleah gave up her search for Uriel. She decided it was time to mourn. I helped her build a memorial to him in the yard.
{{200879108-0-80485:}}I can't stop feeling like it's my fault somehow. Maybe if I hadn't started asking questions. But who knows - maybe Uriel isn't dead after all? Perhaps I should do something about that memorial out back.
{{200879108-0-80484:}}No. Lady Pelena had all but run me out by then. Lady Weatherleah couldn't bring herself to fire me, but I thought some time away would do us all some good. Worst decision of my life, I'll tell you that.
{{200879108-0-80487:}}She caught me going through her things. A terrible thing, I know, but I don't regret it. Some things deserve to be brought to light. You'll see.
{{200879108-0-80486:}}It's my own fault, honestly. Something always felt off to me about Lady Pelena. She never seemed too torn up over Uriel's death. I was convinced she was hiding something, but turns out my chef's paunch doesn't make for being stealthy.
{{200879108-0-80483:}}Captain Leronus suspected an enemy was picking the cohort off one-by-one. He expected a full-scale attack, so he sent the staff into the catacombs with the remaining legionaries to protect them.\n\nI hid here until you and the tribune showed up.
{{200879108-0-80482:}}When the legionaries showed up, we felt a lot safer. A little security in these troubled times.\n\nThen, one by one, soldiers started disappearing. We weren't sure if they were deserting or what. Then I found the bloody legionary armor.
{{200879108-0-79966:}}That's the thing, since his arrival Pelena has been both overjoyed and furious. I suppose his return, after so long, could explain her mixed emotions, but I think she's hiding something. They share terse whispers constantly.
{{200879108-0-79969:}}As this is your first time, I will accompany you into the field. Not everything you need to know is on the page. \n\nI will teach you how to break the Luminary wards and retrieve key fragments to enter the Indrik's domain!
{{200879108-0-81533:}}Well, I …. Before the battle, the tribune sent me to deliver a message to Skingrad. So while you honorably fought, I carried a letter.\n\nI shouldn't complain. Especially in front of a hero. I'm proud to serve Tribune Alea, no matter the task.
{{200879108-0-81408:}}It lies on an island off the southwest coast of Auridon, atop a rise that now features a lighthouse beacon.\n\nYou'll find it, interloper. Just as Ulfsild did, all those years ago.
{{200879108-0-79035:}}Have you not read my books? When the last of the Ayleid kingdoms fell, its people and treasures were scattered throughout Tamriel. The Emblem was one of the symbols of King Dynar, the last ruler of the Ayleids.
{{200879108-0-79036:}}What, really? You don't look that ancient. But then you know that when the last kingdom of the High Elves fell, its people and treasures were scattered. The Emblem was a symbol of King Dynar's reign, and an important Ayleid treasure.
{{200879108-0-79037:}}I don't know how else to explain it. Whatever part of the Many Paths I was hurled into, it was a dark reflection of our reality. Timeless. Empty. Not a world made of mirrors, but the world you see in a mirror.\n\nAm I making any sense?
{{200879108-0-79038:}}These were the only mirrors I found. I couldn't pass through until you used the Lamp. I'm not sure there's a way out of the Many Paths without some sort of help.\n\nLet's stay in this reality, friend. I think we can reach the end of the maze from here.
{{200879108-0-79039:}}I don't know. I never saw her after Vargas cast her spell. She might have been in the world I was trapped in. Or she could be anywhere.\n\nOn the other side, mirrors are like windows. You can see through them, but that's all. I waited here and hoped.
{{200879108-0-80971:}}I don't know. It's hard enough for me to acknowledge my vanity, let alone this rage. I understood my other facets, but this one is something I've been suppressing for a long time.\n\nI'm scared to let her back in.
{{200879108-0-80970:}}Vanity? Is that all you think of me? Just shows how ignorant you are.\n\nI'm Belienne the Bewitching! Sorceress extraordinaire and envy of the Systres! And if you think these bindings are enough to hold me, you're sorely mistaken.
{{200879108-0-82512:}}It's the illness affecting the workers. Took Constable Ulbren, too. We saw the first signs of it a few months back. It started innocently enough. Most thought everyone was working too hard. \n\nBut then those with the illness started dying.
{{200879108-0-79443:}}No! What? No! All of a sudden I'm back … holding Laeni's hand as she takes a shaky step, like a fawn in a glade. Oh my heart.\n\nThis is because of their fathers, isn't it? Nedolir you foolish old man.
{{200879108-0-81531:}}The tribune is one of our best officers. I've served with her since before Clivia Tharn took the throne. We mostly attend to local matters now.\n\nWhile her methods occasionally stray from standard Legion protocol, she always achieves results.
{{200879108-0-80976:}}Ah. Sage's Dream is the mortal name for our connection to the Many Paths. It manifests as a drink, but is brewed from ingredients infused with my very own essence.\n\nDrinking it will reconnect my reflection to the Many Paths and stabilize her power.
{{200879108-0-80940:}}Right! And good timing, all this jumping around has got my paws yelping.\n\nYou go find your door, I'll head back to the Gryphon, and we'll get him talking. Yay!
{{200879108-0-80835:}}Why not me? I'm of the opinion that if you believe something is important, you don't leave it in the hands of others. \n\nThe Green provides, traveler. But it often needs help from mortal hands.
{{200879108-0-79305:}}It's clear the Recollection are everybody's enemy—and the Shardborn, too. I'd be foolish to turn down help wherever I can find it.\n\nBesides, I might have been too quick to assume our new neighbors were behind West Weald's troubles.
{{200879108-0-81536:}}She did? Aye, well, it's an embarrassing memory for the both of us. And one of my more selfish mistakes. If I had done my second check, maybe everyone would still be alive.\n\nI deserved to go to prison for what I did.
{{200879108-0-80942:}}You should've seen him. Wings spread so wide that he could block out the sun. The Gryphon was ready to take on Sheogorath all by himself! \n\nUlfsild was the one that stopped him, froze him here like this. To keep him safe.
{{200879108-0-81373:}}Someone doesn't want us to get to the king. So, make your way to the throne room and find Nantharion. I imagine it's in the upper levels of the treefort.\n\nI've got a grapplebow. I'll stay up in the branches and scout for you. Got it?
{{200879108-0-80558:}}Bought the place almost a year ago. It's old Colovian—late First Era I'm told. The seller claimed Reman III slept here, but I don't see how she'd know that.\n\nI had big dreams for this place. Don't know if they'll work out now.
{{200879108-0-78413:}}Not much, I'm afraid. We're not exactly experts when it comes to Daedra. Our patrols indicate that the creature they dubbed Hessedaz is extremely powerful and quite dangerous. What it wants or why it chose that location is still a mystery to us.
{{200879108-0-79339:}}Someone in the Recollection thinks so. Besides, you don't build a door like that or a lock with a welkynd stone without a reason. Explorers have visited Niryastare many times over the years, but no one's ever gotten past the dead crystal.
{{200879108-0-81610:}}I don't know. \n\nThis could explain why the Goblins are encroaching on the farms more than usual. Maybe the sight of the knife or the smell of it is turning the already angry Goblins against the farmers.
{{200879108-0-79488:}}With a handful of untrained legionaries? Not hardly! But we'll hold this position and wait for reinforcements. And as long as we can hear the bell ringing, we know that Legionary Calvo is still with us.
{{200879108-0-79485:}}Nantharion is dead. Hoperoot is destroyed. The Recollection has no leaders and no friends. Some diehards might linger for a time, but they won't pose a significant threat to West Weald.\n\nNo, I'm more worried about Shardmarshal Vargas and her Prince.
{{200879108-0-79486:}}I have no idea. Maybe they'll never give West Weald another thought now that Ithelia has her power. But she wants vengeance for what was done to her. That might lead to very bad things.\n\nI don't think we've seen the last of them.
{{200879108-0-79481:}}Not much, I'm afraid. Miscarcand is mentioned in several historical accounts of the Ayleid Empire. It was one of the more powerful city-states in the western part of the empire. But until now, no one had any idea where it stood.
{{200879108-0-79483:}}Vashabar deserves a chance. Not everything Nantharion built turned to evil. Somewhere, he lost his way. As did my friend Greenspeaker Sorilen and others who fell in with the Recollection.\n\nI need to go to Vashabar and tell them what happened.
{{200879108-0-79482:}}The city survived Alessia's rebellion and acknowledged her as empress after the White-Gold Tower fell. Miscarcand remained strong enough to deter the Alessian Order in the decades after her death. The Order could not overcome its defenses.
{{200879108-0-79782:}}For my part, yes. Of course, I must persuade some nobles and landowners to part with abandoned estates they can no longer return to. But I want to see the new forest held by allies of Skingrad. Not left empty to be overrun by monsters and outlaws.
{{200879108-0-81617:}}Me? Of course! From chasing illusionary squirrels to Luminary trials. It's been quite a day.\n\nDo you know why it wants me to tag along?
{{200879108-0-79783:}}Now, much of this is beyond me, but the Great Eye said you need to take the three relics that were used to defeat Ithelia and place them near tears in nexus points in the fabric of reality.\n\nThat should restore the frayed threads of fate.
{{200879108-0-81616:}}It was me. The other me, the wrong one. She was terrifying!\n\nShe said I was too pretty and she couldn't stand to look at me. I could tell she wanted to hurt me. She lunged at me, so I ran and never looked back.
{{200879108-0-80695:}}The Riddle of Battle has you slaying not just monsters, but the strongest foes in all of Reaper's March.\n\nYou may not want to face them alone! But that's up to you.
{{200879108-0-80690:}}It's all about the gold, dear. Do try to keep up.\n\nI had a lot of it and I saw the opportunity this vineyard represented. With the proper management, of course.
{{200879108-0-80691:}}You'd rather I chase some fool notion regarding romantic love? That's not how I was raised.\n\nDo I really smell irresistible to vampires? I'm not sure I how I feel about that.
{{200879108-0-80693:}}Obviously that change occurred right before the marriage. But probably not. If he hadn't disappeared without a trace, his family would have disowned him. Marrying a pauper would not have been good business.\n\nI am pleased he seems happy, though.
{{200879108-0-81805:}}I'm not sure, but it can't be good. Beyond the inevitable confusion and damage to my reputation, I don't know what they'll do if they get desperate.\n\nThey're beings of pure emotion, they can't be reasoned with. We need to get them under control.
{{200879108-0-81270:}}Only that it was quick. Organized. I was off duty today, but once I heard screams I sprang into action. Cut down what I could before being nearly torn in two myself.
{{200879108-0-78673:}}Edric? A murderer? I'm astonished. I guess I was right to be suspicious of him, but now I wish I'd had him jailed when I could have. What a travesty. At least we now have some closure and can focus on the missing fortune.
{{200879108-0-78675:}}Well, the Lady and I had intended to meet that morning, but it slipped my mind. If the tea was poisoned … wouldn't that make Otho the suspect? With Edric away, he would have been the one to brew the tea for Lady Weatherleah.
{{200879108-0-78674:}}I haven't the expertise, of course, to make such an accusation, but I do wonder. Otho and Edric have worked the estate for ages. Could they have felt entitled to a cut of the fortune? Useless speculation, perhaps, but the mind does wander.
{{200879108-0-78931:}}Right. Well, back to my townhouse, friend. Give me the map we found. I want to examine it. And we should consult with Leramil, if she's back from her mysterious errand.\n\nIt's clear Ithelia's Daedra are helping the Recollection. We need to know why.
{{200879108-0-81267:}}No, I am sorry. I was making my way back from foraging in the nearby forests when the attacks began. I tried to find my children, but by the time I made it to the gates, the guards refused me entrance. I pray they are safe.
{{200879108-0-80396:}}Oh. Oh, no. Someone is hunting the Scarlets? It's just as my son feared. My past has caught up to me again.\n\nI should have known it when I found the note on my doorstep.
{{200879108-0-80390:}}It's been a long time since I did anything adventurous, but I still recall my Legion training. And I trust the Divines will see that I have safe passage.\n\nMay Stendarr watch over you, friend.
{{200879108-0-80134:}}You're not wrong, friend. But if we know of places where King Nantharion used Ithelia's staff, I want to find out exactly what he did there. That might tell us where he's going next.
{{200879108-0-80131:}}Look, I'm not one of those Ravenwatch vampire do-gooders, but I couldn't abide what Balandrus was becoming. What he was turning the gang into. But when I heard he had returned and was calling himself the Terror of the Weald, I had to do something.
{{200879108-0-78883:}}The Many Paths? Sounds important but I don't know anything about it. But there's a tavern not far from here. Called the Outcast Inn. You should check it out when we're done here.\n\nLet's keep going. If the Echonir has more to show us, let me know.
{{200879108-0-78880:}}I'm sorry to say that one of my principal talents as an adventurer was getting into places I wasn't supposed to be. I generally served as the trap expert and lock-picker of the party. Guess I've always been interested in puzzles.
{{200879108-0-78881:}}Incredible. That was a Daedric Prince? She didn't seem all that powerful or scary. In fact, she appeared to be disoriented. \n\nSo, why was that important? What exactly was that a memory of?
{{200879108-0-78734:}}An invasion launched from Rustwall Estate would have taken Skingrad completely by surprise. I'm glad that you and the tribune were there to stop them.\n\nBut the Recollection working with Daedra? That's a troubling new development.
{{200879108-0-81043:}}A commitment I can respect. The role of protector often goes unsung in bardic songs. Even knights who should know better want to leap into the fray.\n\nIt takes discipline and heart to be a protector. Discipline like yours.
{{200879108-0-81040:}}Ages ago, Ulfsild and I researched an ancient type of mystical soldier. I imagined these constructs as silent protectors, watching over the Scholarium's halls.\n\nWith the untamed power of the Daedric Princes, finally our vision will become reality.
{{200879108-0-80820:}}Whatever your answer was, it was just one of many that might solve that simple question. I, in turn, might have said gratitude or affection.\n\nIt's important that you learn from my mistakes before attempting to craft your riddle.
{{200879108-0-79757:}}Not permanently … I don't think. Probably just wants to reward you. The Great Eye knows how much you mortals appreciate shiny objects.\n\nBut to be safe, I suggest you talk to all your allies first. Last farewells and all that.
{{200879108-0-81161:}}We try to be civilized in here in Skingrad. If I have a problem with a business, I tell them or summon the guard. I don't attack their stall! But the Recollection didn't choose that route. Now I'm not sure if I will either.\n\nI guess I'll find out.
{{200879108-0-81842:}}I wish to know more myself, but the storm fills my mind. The knowledge of the Many Paths comes to me in bursts, as intuitions. They are possibilities not yet realized. Realities close and distant.\n\nIf I can calm my mind, maybe I'll understand.
{{200879108-0-81840:}}Thank you but no. I'm not willing to risk any more lives against those bandits—not even yours. Not when the alert has been sounded and reinforcements are on the way.\n\nThey'll be here. Eventually. Then we'll show those deserters what for!
{{200879108-0-81841:}}Remembering is a struggle. I cannot extract details from the chaos of converging realities.\n\nThere is darkness. Then I saw a light in the distance. The light became this inn. It summoned me but the reason was unclear. Until I recalled Sage's Dream.
{{200879108-0-81847:}}There is a world of magic beyond your mortal ken, adventurer. With the Luminaries at your side, there is nothing you cannot accomplish.\n\nSpeak to your knight. Consider my offer.
{{200879108-0-81845:}}This altar focuses power to shape the very heart of magic itself. If we're going to get things under control, I'll need to talk you through the rite of Scribing.\n\nBut first things first. There should be an old focus or two in the east wing. Hurry.
{{200879108-0-78631:}}Perhaps the fantasy is the clue? Only a panicked hand could make such messy brush strokes. Could Otho's arrival from the market have startled the suspect? Leading them to block the door and escape out of the broken window?
{{200879108-0-78270:}}They are a very powerful mercantile family and any misstep could spell disaster for my marriage proposal. It's been a grueling year of negotiations between our families. Would you believe I haven't even met my bride to be?
{{200879108-0-78773:}}Wellsprings of power? Huh. I've got no idea.\n\nAll right. If you destroyed the seeds the Recollection planted, they'll need to replace them. That means we still have a chance to find Nantharion. Let's take another look at the Skein.
{{200879108-0-80711:}}That's all right, we all make mistakes sometimes. The Aldmeri Dominion is forgiving to its members, even with nonsense like the fighting over the Green Pact and the Dawnway.
{{200879108-0-80710:}}That's all right, we all make mistakes sometimes. The Aldmeri Dominion is forgiving to its members, even with nonsense like the fighting over the Green Pact and the Dawnway.
{{200879108-0-80713:}}What a novel idea. I'll admit to some relief that our arranged marriage is over. I have always been a bit of a romantic and this merger by way of marriage was less than ideal. Perhaps I will. A proper courtship. If she agrees of course.
{{200879108-0-80716:}}I think we do just as they did in the fable. Here, allow me.
{{200879108-0-78632:}}A secretive and violent order called the Recollection scours ruins throughout the Weald. Strange Daedric creatures harry the region. And the Wood Elf, King Nantharion, reigns over a newly grown forest—a sure sign the threads of fate have frayed.
{{200879108-0-78776:}}The Recollection? Yes, we have heard of this new order but it has nothing to do with Vashabar. Do you really expect to find such violent agitators in this peaceful hamlet?
{{200879108-0-78777:}}Greenspeaker Sorilen helped us settle Dawnwood and build our town, but I haven't seen her in weeks. I assumed she had done her part and returned to Valenwood. Not everyone is prepared to break away from the familiar and start anew.
{{200879108-0-81930:}}As am I. Hopefully we learn more as we travel. The last path was clarifying, but I still feel overwhelmed. I am no more in control of myself than I was before.\n\nLet us proceed, mortal.
{{200879108-0-81804:}}Better than before. Bubbly, even, despite the nausea. My delight did the drinking. Now I'll get to deal with the consequences.\n\nStill, it's better than the despair I was feeling earlier. I find the melodrama exhausting, even when it's my own.
{{200879108-0-78816:}}Do you see the empty sockets? The mage I came here with years ago thought we needed lesser welkynds to restore the great welkynd stone. But we couldn't find any.\n\nJudging from these notes, the Recollection's experiencing the same problem.
{{200879108-0-82200:}}The life of an arcane investigator is never quiet. Delving into hidden caves or scouring ruins always gives a delightful thrill.\n\nIt helps to have partner like yourself. Someone like Shelaria and her forceful rebukes makes the job a challenge.
{{200879108-0-81922:}}But of course you do! Ask away, my new friend. Happy to help in any way I can.
{{200879108-0-81801:}}How should I know? I only met him once, and he was not buoyant at all.\n\nUlfsild spent much of her time here, free of him. I always thought she floated much higher on her own. She would have made a great netch.
{{200879108-0-81924:}}I believe so, yes. I have a good imagination, you can ask anyone. \n\nBut I can think of few other reasons for an indrik fawn to be traipsing about the depths of an ancient library carved from a Summerset island.
{{200879108-0-78578:}}It's been years since they've taken any interest in my needs. Why would I care for theirs? They've made it plainly clear I wasn't the daughter they prayed for. Too quick to fight. Too tough to bend.\n\nAnd still they tried to force me into shape.
{{200879108-0-81455:}}Indeed. Well, except for our servants and willing blood vassals. As I said, we have a mission. We follow the teaching of Count Verandis Ravenwatch—we take no blood by force, help those in need, and curtail the actions of hostile vampires.
{{200879108-0-81791:}}She went wild. Ordered the patrol to attack what was clearly a superior Daedric force. Then she fled. Used her soldiers to cover her own escape. I just reacted. Struck her a glancing blow.\n\nNow … tell her I deserted. Or died. Doesn't matter to me.
{{200879108-0-81459:}}That's … I'd rather not speculate. Wood Elf magic can speed and direct growth, but not on this scale. And not so wild and untamed that it destroys whole villages.\n\nStill, I plan to look into all that. Later. After we help these people.
{{200879108-0-80289:}}It looks like Nantharion intends to plant more wildburn seeds. I thought we were finished with all that at Hoperoot.\n\nWhat really worries me is the suggestion that the wildburn ritual has another purpose.
{{200879108-0-78976:}}The true origins of Fargrave are lost. Did she come here to access another plane, or could this demiplane have once been a part of Mirrormoor?\n\nWell, we shall not find our allies or the answers we seek standing here. Let us continue.
{{200879108-0-82049:}}If I must. The others are … fine.\n\nLuminary. I've never been overly fond of that term. Ulfsild was insistent that for scholarship, she needed a word. A way to refer to us. It suffices, I suppose.
{{200879108-0-80280:}}Missing something. Not quite right. It stood out because we found copies of the Fable of the Dragon all over the library. \n\nWe couldn't tell which one was Ulfsild's annotated copy because, well, that's your thing. However, we did find an echo.
{{200879108-0-78843:}}We'll need to be careful. If our suspicions are on the mark, someone won't want us to talk to the king.\n\nHoperoot lies near the ruins of Nonungalo, across the Wildburn. Let's meet outside the new settlement and see how things stand.
{{200879108-0-79741:}}Constable Ulbren was a good man. Kept the peace here. Made sure the workers—both native townsfolk and recent arrivals—got along.\n\nHe was a friend. I know he was concerned about the illness spreading through town. Shame it killed him.
{{200879108-0-81007:}}Most mortals quake in fear at my presence or demand one boon or another. But all you seek is knowledge? Interesting.\n\nAsk your questions then, pathwalker.
{{200879108-0-80562:}}I wanted to turn this establishment into a high-end place known for its most unusual drinks. All for a reasonable cost for the common traveler.\n\nI concoct my own recipes from scratch, you know. Everyone deserves a drink made with skill and care.
{{200879108-0-80566:}}You aren't here. This place isn't here. I'm not really here. Go away.
{{200879108-0-81763:}}There is a complication. Three Shardborn valkynazes accompany each champion. The valkynazes spread out, shielding the champion while they summon minions. Before you can attack the champion, you must defeat the valkynazes who protect it.
{{200879108-0-81766:}}So goes the tale! Akatosh answered her visions. The demigod Morihaus and the hero Pelinal Whitestrake joined her cause. \n\nTogether they tore down the Daedric shrines of the Elves and founded the great Empire of Cyrodiil.
{{200879108-0-81765:}}The Slave Queen of Cyrodiil. Saint Alessia led a rebellion against the Ayleids three thousand years ago.\n\nAt the time the humans of Tamriel were harnessed as workers by the cruel Heartland Elves. Until Alessia and the Eight intervened.
{{200879108-0-81764:}}The Mirrormoor champion and their valkynazes are powerful foes indeed—too much for any single adventurer. It would be wise to avoid battle until you have others at your side.\n\nThere is no honor in failing alone.
{{200879108-0-81769:}}What other explanation is there? My father Ulbren was town constable. He wrote to me about investigating some suspicious deaths, then suddenly I get a letter telling me he had died.\n\nI requested leave from the Legion and returned as fast as I could.
{{200879108-0-82073:}}That's excellent. I'd go looking for a focal point near the echo you accessed earlier. If I know Ulfsild, and I do, she'd have made sure her notes were somewhere nearby.\n\nI'll send Nahlia your way if she comes looking for you.
{{200879108-0-79173:}}How strange. A mortal who walks the Many Paths without understanding them. Between that, keeping company with my reflection, and bearing the Lamp of Clarity, you intrigue me.\n\nVery well. Ask your questions.
{{200879108-0-79172:}}The Lamp of Clarity. A relic created to hunt me and my Unseen. It carries a spark of its creator, Azura, within. That gives it a bit of awareness. It must know that your Ithelia poses a threat.\n\nBut why lead you to me?
{{200879108-0-79176:}}I shall set things right. The echoes I dragged from disparate paths are free to return to their own realms. And allow me to untangle the threads of fate and restore balance to this reality.\n\nI thank you, pathwalker. And I am jealous of you.
{{200879108-0-79179:}}We learned that every Ithelia is dangerous, a broken creature that ends up hunted. We cannot change who we are.\n\nBut mortals? You choose your paths. You don't need the powers of a Daedric Prince to alter your fate. I envy this. Goodbye, pathwalker.
{{200879108-0-81638:}}A little. You usually find bugs that big deep underground. I remember seeing lots of them while clearing Goblins out of caves.\n\nSomething must have driven them to the surface.
{{200879108-0-80944:}}Ulfsild knew that in a fight between a Luminary and a Daedric Prince, the Gryphon would lose. He's probably mad at her.\n\nBut I'm grateful. I don't know what I would do if I didn't still have him around. And now you're here!
{{200879108-0-80945:}}I have been trapped here for a very long time, mortal. I did not feel the full passage of time. But I know it's been many years. I know Ulfsild is dead. \n\nAnd I know what happened to Eyevea.
{{200879108-0-80946:}}Focused. Driven. You remind me of Ulfsild. But I suppose that's to be expected. Give me a moment to gather my thoughts, mortal. \n\nPlace the fable upon the dais. And if you want, speak to my companion. He'll be eager to chat, no doubt.
{{200879108-0-80943:}}Ulfsild conjured up a mighty blizzard to freeze him, and hung the magic on a ward she left behind. You should be able to dispel it just like you do the other wards.\n\nJust … just so you know, he might be a little grumpy? Sorry in advance.
{{200879108-0-80790:}}It's the ancient heritage of the Wild Elves, the Ayleids. They worked with natural materials in the forest, picking fruit from trees and harvesting the wood sometimes. I don't see a problem with it, but it's caused quite a stir.
{{200879108-0-78767:}}Does he? Well let me take a look. Hmm. This appears to be a greenspring seed, but it's unlike any that I've ever worked with before. It's infused with strange energy.
{{200879108-0-79425:}}Sounds good!
{{200879108-0-81051:}}I knew I liked you!
{{200879108-0-79684:}}To summarize, Molag Bal, the Daedric Lord of Domination, opposes the desires of others as his nature. Should everyone express the desire for him to exist, would he therefore have to cease to exist to remain true to his nature?
{{200879108-0-79683:}}Certainly! What would an aspiring sophist such as yourself care to discuss about it?
{{200879108-0-79682:}}Agmund and I have enjoyed our discussions in Skingrad. One scholar suggested we go get lost. An excellent idea! We're thinking of getting lost in West Weald on our way home!
{{200879108-0-80143:}}They're not as frightened of other creatures. I suppose having a camp near Gray's Hollow will do that. They do tend to get into more mischief because they're not as intimidated by the farms, but they're also not as reactionary.
{{200879108-0-81680:}}The Slave Queen of Cyrodiil. Saint Alessia led a rebellion against the Ayleids three thousand years ago.\n\nAt the time the humans of Tamriel were harnessed as workers by the cruel Heartland Elves. Until Alessia and the Eight intervened.
{{200879108-0-81364:}}I prefer Ayrenn to most Altmer nobles I've met. But you can admire someone personally and still disagree with their choices. The Ruby Throne is a fool's dream. Even if she wins it, how does that help Bosmer who just want to be left in peace?
{{200879108-0-81856:}}Oh, me? Not much to tell really. I grew up in a guild family. My mother is an adept and my father was a researcher back in Elden Root. \n\nI started off sort of following in the family business but most magic just kind of … eludes me.
{{200879108-0-81851:}}Is that so? What curious timing. Did the Archmagus think to mention the Scholarium or its treasures? No? I am not surprised.\n\nWhen Shalidor's foolish pact lost him the island, Ulfsild's precious work was taken as well.
{{200879108-0-81850:}}As they, themselves, once taught Ulfsild. Yes. The Luminaries understand magic in a way mortals never could. \n\nTheir power, freely given, will allow you access to arcane mysteries others could only dream of.
{{200879108-0-80798:}}It told me of Elic's life. His wife. His work as a respected historian.\n\nElic was happy, and I was happy to hear it. I left these ruins, but I didn't have the courage to write my son until I fell ill. And then it was too late to make amends.
{{200879108-0-81853:}}Of course! We really jumped into the boggy end of the swamp together, didn't we? \n\nAnswering a few questions is the least I can do for the world's foremost expert on Scribing.
{{200879108-0-80791:}}It's an ancient Wood Elf custom, handed down from Y'ffre himself. We protect the Green, and in return, it provides for us. There's more to it, but that's the gist.
{{200879108-0-80793:}}Well, some clans here hold tight to the Green Pact, but others follow a new path—the Dawnway. They both have merit, but the faithful on either side don't see it that way.\n\nI expect more from Dominion folk than petty arguments!
{{200879108-0-80792:}}I agree with whatever is best for the Dominion. Let each clan choose the path that suits them. This bickering is a distraction from real problems!\n\nBut, I shouldn't be telling you this. I'm supposed to be recruiting right now.
{{200879108-0-80795:}}It's the ancient heritage of the Wild Elves, the Ayleids. They worked with natural materials in the forest, picking fruit from trees and harvesting the wood sometimes. I don't see a problem with it, but it's caused quite a stir.
{{200879108-0-80794:}}It's an ancient Wood Elf custom, handed down from Y'ffre himself. We protect the Green, and in return, it provides for us. There's more to it, but that's the gist.
{{200879108-0-80796:}}I agree with whatever is best for the Dominion. Let each clan choose the path that suits them. This bickering is a distraction from real problems!\n\nBut, I shouldn't be telling you this. I'm supposed to be recruiting right now.
{{200879108-0-78766:}}Calvo is brave to a fault and shows a wagon full of promise, but I barely started training this batch of recruits when the deserters attacked.\n\nHe's still weak as a bantam guar and doesn't know which side of the sword to point at an enemy, but ….
{{200879108-0-81859:}}Votary Llaren and I have gotten each other out of more scrapes than I can count. Julian is sour as a plum, but she's one of the smartest people I know. \n\nAnd Irnard doesn't look like much but he cuts through guild politics like a spellforged blade.
{{200879108-0-81538:}}I'm still thinking it over, but what happened at Gray's Hollow helped me understand the threat that ignorance and misinformation poses to all of Tamriel's creatures. If even a little scientific study can help us understand others, I should do it.
{{200879108-0-81689:}}She's got an incredible aptitude for portal magic, taught me everything I know. She'd have made a fine adept if she didn't love that sword so much ….\n\nAt least, I think she loves it. She's hard to read these days. Very focused on work, like I said.
{{200879108-0-82136:}}It may take time for common folk to understand that not all Wood Elves are Recollection. And that Vashabar had no idea Nantharion was responsible for the new forest.\n\nOpening trade and helping heal the devastation will go a long way in that regard.
{{200879108-0-78948:}}It's a little late now. I'll find him after the first round of bidding.\n\nAs for you, bear in mind that the pleasures of my estate are meant for master vampires intent on bidding in the auction. Do not overstep your station.
{{200879108-0-82134:}}Sun and roots willing, we'll be married before the next crisis comes along. Just as soon as we help the greenspeaker finalize negotiations with the count.\n\nDamn me if it doesn't, traveler, but I think things just may work out.
{{200879108-0-82131:}}I plan to make lucrative connections with all of the Weald's most important and influential citizens. That's just good business.
{{200879108-0-82130:}}I put that behind me long ago. But don't tell Fennorian. I could use his help to get the vineyards back up and running, and his guilt is an excellent motivator.\n\nOh, don't worry. I won't take undue advantage of the situation. Much.
{{200879108-0-81687:}}The standard for knights inducted into the order soar higher than Ceporah Tower. We don't just take anyone who can swing a blade.\n\nEspecially these days.
{{200879108-0-80722:}}Let me look.\n\nHere, this part about the river settlement. I'd bet anything that's Balmora. Lovely place. There's a big river running through the middle of town. Sounds like it was even bigger back when the fable was written.
{{200879108-0-80729:}}Then I suppose we're both right. Perhaps there's a few potential answers these riddles could have.\n\nThough for your sake, hopefully not. Good luck out there.
{{200879108-0-78890:}}I find it interesting. I knew Ithelia had been imprisoned, but not by whom. I can understand her anger at Hermaeus Mora. Daedric Princes don't forget, and they never forgive. That's part of their nature.
{{200879108-0-81865:}}I only know what little I can recall. As if the knowledge comes from my core, but must still fight through the ceaseless storm.\n\nThe Many Paths are possibilities, roads to different outcomes, different realities. Perhaps this one leads to clarity.
{{200879108-0-79245:}}The constable said she found something at the healer's that pointed to a possible source of fatigue fever. She asked me to let you know. And that you should meet up with her.\n\nShe wants you to help her search Carvain Manor and Lady Raxalee's tower.
{{200879108-0-79242:}}I didn't realize that sickness and illness were now the purview of the town constable. I can tell you what I know.\n\nA strange disease has befallen workers at my ranch and at Raxalee's quarry. Unfortunate, but there's no crime that I can see.
{{200879108-0-79241:}}Is it? No matter. None of this is a concern to me and I have no idea how to help you. I have enough to do just keeping the ranch running in these difficult times.\n\nSo, if there is nothing else, I'll bid you good day and good luck with your inquiries.
{{200879108-0-78688:}}The Echonir? Yes, that is what the Abyssal Cephaliarch called it. A clever little device he wrought to find and remove things that belonged to me. Thoughts. Memories. Truths he did not want anyone to know.\n\nShow me. I wish to see what it reveals.
{{200879108-0-78682:}}Elenglynn? An Ayleid ruin, most likely a temple or monastery. As you can see, little remains above ground. The vaults below are more extensive, or so I have read.\n\nAdventurers report dangerous monsters and traps within. Those who survived, anyway.
{{200879108-0-80108:}}I'm not concerned about lines on a map. People are getting hurt! The devastated area at the border of the forest is ruining farms and spawning dangerous beasts. Not to mention the attacks by the Recollection.\n\nSomeone needs to answer for all this.
{{200879108-0-80459:}}Marcan Caelum. The master of the manor. I thought he died in the fire. I'd give anything to go back to that day, but some things cannot be undone.\n\nVengeance won't bring back Marcan's family. We have to go to Caelum Vineyard and end this.
{{200879108-0-80456:}}Damn it all! The bastard got another one of us!\n\nWho's behind this? Why are they doing this to us?
{{200879108-0-80457:}}I can't believe it. He survived? But this marking … no, there's no mistake. It all points back to my last bloody mistake—Caelum Vineyard.\n\nThe family wasn't supposed to be home. There was a struggle, a fire. We got out, but they didn't.
{{200879108-0-81479:}}This may surprise you, as our last moment together was a tempest of frost and ice, but Ulfsild and I were great collaborators. \n\nBefore the departure of the Scholarium, we dreamed of ever-vigilant watchers that would protect the complex.
{{200879108-0-81156:}}My pet bear cub is lost. Lord Svendalmor of the Burnt-Biscuits is his courtly name, but everyone calls him Burnbiscuit. One of my soldiers, Legionary Luther is searching for him, but I haven't heard anything.
{{200879108-0-81157:}}My thanks, traveler. Legionary Luther was searching west of Skingrad, where we lost my dear Burnbiscuit. Be careful, though, that devastated region is fairly nasty.
{{200879108-0-80130:}}I went out of the way to put my time with Balandrus behind me. But when I heard he had returned to Sutch and was calling himself the Terror of the Weald … had turned the gang into murderers … I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.
{{200879108-0-78330:}}You mean, why am I recruiting adventurers to help the Legion instead of fighting on the line myself? I have experience with Daedric troubles, so I know what skills we're looking for to stop the Mirrormoor incursions.\n\nI don't hire just anybody.
{{200879108-0-78331:}}I wish we knew. Mirrormoor must be a Daedric realm, since the incursions are made up of Daedric monsters and Shardborn warriors. That's what the Dremora we meet in battle call themselves, anyway. The Legion's mages have never heard of them.
{{200879108-0-78333:}}It's rare, yes. However, legionaries come from all backgrounds. My own involved an education in matters most Redguards do not care to study. Magic, Daedric relics, and other such things. I could not go home after that. But the Legion took me in.
{{200879108-0-78334:}}Our mages speculate that some long-lost plane of Oblivion has come into conjunction with our world. Doors sealed shut for ages are now open, so Mirrormoor's forces seized the opportunity to invade.\n\nWhatever they want, it's up to us to stop them.
{{200879108-0-78335:}}Well, it's usually a lot more lively. When Count Calantius isn't in residence or it isn't filled with visiting dignitaries, there's still the entire household staff. But so far I haven't found a soul. No signs of a battle or struggle yet, either.
{{200879108-0-78336:}}I suppose introductions are in order. I am Tribune Alea Idolus of the West Weald Legion, marshal to Count Calantius, daughter of Quatrius Idolus, knight of Colovia.\n\nA mouthful, I know, but I enjoy reciting my entire pedigree from time to time.
{{200879108-0-78338:}}When ancient magicka coalesces into physical form, it sometimes binds itself to its surroundings like a barnacle on the side of a boat.\n\nThe alarum is a handy little tool that pries those barnacles free.
{{200879108-0-78339:}}Get it? From my mind, I guess. My mentor, Master Lucianos, gave me a problem to solve, so I made the alarum to solve it.\n\nOf course, he'll be the one who gets the credit with inventing it, if it actually works.
{{200879108-0-81372:}}That's … a pity. Tell Grander I have a sister. A sweet little thing, eager for love. But warn him, no dowry. Do it right. Court her. They need to decide for themselves, not our parents.
{{200879108-0-81109:}}The Legion built the keep late in the First Era as part of Reman Cyrodiil's initial Imperial expansion. It's seen quite a few battles over the centuries.\n\nNow we use it to protect the trade roads and to keep an eye on the new forest.
{{200879108-0-81108:}}It's good to know someone before you rush into battle with them.\n\nAnything else before we head out?
{{200879108-0-81107:}}My father. A shrewd merchant in his time, or so I've been told. He died soon after I was born.\n\nThe wealth he left behind meant I got a good education. Which didn't hurt my rise in the Legion. For that, I'm grateful to him.
{{200879108-0-81106:}}As the war for the Ruby Throne broke out, I was assigned to defend Colovian borders. Our orders were to repel any usurper army that tried to cross through.\n\nCount Calantius respected my skill and brought me into his service.
{{200879108-0-81103:}}I will take those. They should not be left unaccounted for. The temple of Arkay has measures in place to safeguard such dangerous objects and prevent them from causing any further harm.
{{200879108-0-81102:}}I am not sure. They may have been drawn to the necrotic energy generated by the ritual. There are rumors of similar Daedric attacks across West Weald, but no one knows where they are coming from. I will be sure to mention them in my record.
{{200879108-0-81101:}}Julian and Llaren are working to strengthen our wards. If this was that fox stealing the pages, perhaps they'll be enough to catch it when it returns.\n\nAnd of course, if you need help with something, come back here and I'll do what I can.
{{200879108-0-81100:}}We haven't beaten Ithelia. Can you even truly defeat a Daedric Prince? We broke her toy and stopped her for now. But she seemed very angry and determined to settle old scores at the end. She'll be back.\n\nLet me know when you need me, comrade.
{{200879108-0-80853:}}That's more troubling. Those are definitely troll marks, but we weren't attacked by a troll. That troll may be tracking Burnbiscuit. Oh, poor cub! You have to find him and lead him back here!
{{200879108-0-80850:}}Keshargo always forgets introductions when he is faced with problems.\n\nKeshargo is the former Magnastylus— leader of the Scribes of Mora. We are cartographers and knowledge seekers who travel the planes in service of Hermorah.
{{200879108-0-80164:}}I suppose I'll settle down here and make sure the two camps are protected from more interference. They deserve the same safety that the farmers want for themselves. I'm sure, in time, the farmers can learn to not be so scared of Goblins.
{{200879108-0-79458:}}I'm angry. I just have a hard time letting it out like Laeni does. I was so proud to move here with the rest of my kin, sure I'd marry my beloved in this beautiful new village.\n\nBut you saw what we're up against.
{{200879108-0-79459:}}I'm slightly exaggerating. But while the language of my people is expressive and beautiful, we have no word for fundamentally-disagree-with-to-the-point-of-violence.
{{200879108-0-79456:}}Since before we crossed the Strid to settle Vashabar, there's been a tension in the clan. The ways of the ancients in conflict with our devotion to the Green. Now maybe we can put that all behind us.
{{200879108-0-79457:}}I don't know. I'm still trying to adjust. But our ancient ancestors faced adversity and still made it to Valenwood. Escaped an old life to start a new one. Perhaps … that's what happened here today.\n\nAnd I do like Laeni!
{{200879108-0-79455:}}Hah, do you know how long I've been trying to smack some sense into my brother? Or old Minth? \n\nI don't think about the Singer much, but I might go listen to Belwelas preach. Just because you came walking down the road.
{{200879108-0-79450:}}The Dawnway, the philosophy my family and I follow, draws heavily from ideas and concepts in Ayleid culture. \n\nThe Heartland Elves were cruel at times, but they were also magnificent artisans and explorers.
{{200879108-0-79451:}}A Rite of Propagation? Did you put them up to this?\n\nThere hasn't been a rite like this enacted since I was a child back in Valenwood! What does my daughter hope to accomplish with this archaic rite?
{{200879108-0-80534:}}A hint of insolence lurks in that query. You convinced two Daedric Princes to change course. Do you doubt your own convictions?\n\nNo matter. Ithelia has gone to a reality where she has no power, and you destroyed the only path between here and there.
{{200879108-0-80007:}}There aren't many Votaries in the order right now. Part of why I joined up. \n\nI tried the adept's life, before that. Being a Lamp Knight suits me better. Even if I still get called on for my portal magic just as much as before.
{{200879108-0-81938:}}Other Daedric Princes, led by Hermaeus Mora, approach, coming to imprison Ithelia. Despite my protests, she refuses to resist them.\n\nAfter all the battles, I do not understand why she now chooses to just … surrender. It makes no sense!
{{200879108-0-81939:}}You are my enemy yet you still live? Perhaps there is more to you than I thought, mortal. Or, more likely, the Vargas of your path is a coward who runs from battles.\n\nEither way, should you start a fight here, I will end you quickly.
{{200879108-0-81022:}}With the lens you should be able to find your way! Just watch out for weird Apocrypha magic. \n\nAnd traps. Hermaeus Mora loves traps. Don't worry, I believe in you!
{{200879108-0-81987:}}Oh, I. Hahahaha. No, no, no, no, no. How could you confuse me with a Luminary? We're nothing alike.\n\nI'm a talking fox.
{{200879108-0-79858:}}The Valenwood forest mysteriously expanded across the River Strid and replaced the previous Colovian terrain. The Wood Elves who settled the area call it Dawnwood. King Nantharion rules a new Bosmer realm beneath its thick canopy.
{{200879108-0-79850:}}We know that Daedric relics such as the Echonir were used to help defeat Ithelia in ancient times. Perhaps such items shall play a part again. For now, knowledge must be our weapon of choice, and our task is to arm ourselves as best we can.
{{200879108-0-81985:}}Truly? Impressive to think you may have bested the Daedric Prince of nonsense.\n\nYou have a Luminary's apology, mortal. This has not been an easy awakening. Once, my feathers were armor. My talons cut stone and my beak could rend the sky itself.
{{200879108-0-79855:}}Ah, see, you took the words right out of my mouth.\n\nClose the doors if you can. I'll see what I can do to stabilize the focusing crystal on the altar.
{{200879108-0-81982:}}Exactly what Sorilen suggests. We need to find it and keep it out of the hands of the Recollection. If it's somehow connected to the creation of this new forest and the area of devastation, we can't let them get a hold of it.\n\nLet's get moving.
{{200879108-0-81600:}}The Dawnway teaches us that knowledge of the past can build a path to the future. \n\nOur Wilderhall holds all the old knowledge of our clan. Maybe there's something in there that could help Laeni and Clendagal find happiness?
{{200879108-0-81602:}}I can't. I teach the children if they want to leave, they should. It would be wrong to say different to Laeni. But … hmm.\n\nYou should speak to Spinner Belwelas. He's the keeper of the Wilderhall here in the village.
{{200879108-0-81603:}}You've seen the state she's in. She doesn't even realize the effect she's having on existence. She's just so full of rage and anger. If we don't act—and by we, I mean you—by the time she realizes what she's doing, it will be too late to stop it.
{{200879108-0-81604:}}Haven't you been paying attention? This is the very threat that Hermaeus Mora contracted you to help stop! You've accomplished a lot as fate's chosen, but Ithelia is still out there, loose and destroying reality one piece at a time.
{{200879108-0-80955:}}It'd be unbecoming of a knight like myself to advise on Thieves Guild happenings.\n\nSo I definitely won't tell you to look for heist jobs at the den in Abah's Landing. You'd have to be more than a petty thief to get access to jobs like that.
{{200879108-0-78937:}}The Outcast Inn? I know the place.\n\nNot only did we stop Nantharion from sending a wildburn seed to Skingrad. We found Recollection notes pointing to Feldagard Keep, as well as a memory of Ithelia heading toward the Outcast Inn. And that's not all.
{{200879108-0-78934:}}That might better be pondered by Leramil, but you're probably on to something. Both the Recollection and the Shardborn serve the Prince of Paths. Their goals must complement each other, somehow.\n\nWhich brings up another question. Where's Ithelia?
{{200879108-0-78933:}}Not as grim as it sounds. The count ordered the catacombs converted into a shelter a while back. He wanted a place for anyone in residence to hide should war sweep over Colovia.\n\nLet's hope the rest of the cohort and the servants are safe and secure.
{{200879108-0-80882:}}Do you know nothing of the intricacies of Colovian etiquette and protocol? Slights and insults have consequence! And Count Calantius is particularly sensitive to the smallest slander.\n\nWhere you see an innocent mistake, I see disaster!
{{200879108-0-80887:}}He has a retinue of necromancers to claim the bodies of those he slays with his lightning.\n\nHe also gloats. Xoryn kept laughing about how everything will be righted when he claims the arcane knot.
{{200879108-0-81305:}}Honestly, I have no idea. Didn't hatch there, and the one time I visited, everyone stared at me like I was missing my tail.\n\nBut the healers there know some things I don't. Could help Val. Anyway, I have to try.
{{200879108-0-82026:}}A wildburn seed? I've never heard of such a thing, but then again, I'm not a greenspeaker or a spinner. And what did Darolith make of this strange seed? I know she's been trying to determine how our Dawnwood came to be. Does she suspect a connection?
{{200879108-0-80636:}}No. Most of them thought they were following a benign leader. They'd be horrified to know that the devastation of the wildburn is the reason Vashabar exists.\n\nAfter what we learned at Hoperoot, Vashabar now sees Nantharion for the villain he is.
{{200879108-0-80635:}}The Recollection's a revived Ayleid cult dedicated to Ithelia. Nantharion's trying to restore her power and receive her blessing.\n\nFrom the number of locations the Skein shows where the staff was used, he's about to unleash more wildburn. A lot more.
{{200879108-0-80630:}}Not yet. We want to see how the talks between the greenspeaker and the count work out. Laeni doesn't want our celebration to get lost in the brambles should relations between Dawnwood and the rest of the Weald take a turn for the worse. Soon, though!
{{200879108-0-81636:}}It means I am a priest of Y'ffre, God of the Forest. As a spinner of tales, I hear his song and weave his stories for all to hear.\n\nEveryone in Vashabar believes in Y'ffre's grace, whether they adhere to the Green Pact or travel the Dawnway.
{{200879108-0-80364:}}It's not that simple … or perhaps it is.\n\nYou're right. The ring is just an object. My faith and the choices I make are the only things that matter. And right now, my friends need me.
{{200879108-0-80365:}}I'm sorry to hear that. He must have been a truly desperate soul to attempt such a brazen robbery. May Arkay guide his soul to rest.\n\nI owe you thanks for retrieving my ring, friend. I'm fortunate our paths met.
{{200879108-0-80362:}}I was penning some verses when a pickpocket stole a ring right off my finger! Now he's holed up in Varen's Watch. I would go in after him, but I sense something impure lurking inside. And I'm not the Orc I used to be.
{{200879108-0-78601:}}Of course, though I doubt I'd be of much help. I was tending to affairs in High Isle when I learned of my aunt's death. As her last living blood relative, I saw fit to see to her will. Until my cousin's convenient reappearance, of course.
{{200879108-0-78602:}}It was what Mora saw when he examined my threads of fate. That I would become the Unweaver, the Destroyer of Reality. In that last moment, as the door to my prison slammed shut and my memories frayed, I saw it, too. But it was too late.
{{200879108-0-78603:}}Magical relics make for a lucrative import as long as inspections and magical protections aren't in the way. The merchant lords pressured me to waive these precautions, and for what? So a few trade masters could fill their coffers.
{{200879108-0-78604:}}That's a relief. You've taken a great weight off my shoulders, traveler. Leftwheal may just see another sunrise thanks to your efforts.
{{200879108-0-78606:}}As I understand it, she fell from her library's ladder while reaching for a book. If she had kept a modest staff on hand, perhaps she could have been saved, but by the time she was found … she had passed.
{{200879108-0-78608:}}Help them? I don't even know what they were doing. \n\nBut I keep wondering, what if they were trying to raise those minotaurs as their thralls? Bet they could have done it too, if only they had these Aetherial shards for an extra bit of power.
{{200879108-0-78609:}}I haven't seen Uriel since we were teens, before I was sent to boarding school. And then he left to fight in Varen's revolt six years ago. He might share a passing resemblance, even with his scar, but I don't believe he's really Uriel.
{{200879108-0-79957:}}You saw what I saw at Ostumir. My old friend Sorilen has lost her way. If she had a hand in the use of wildburn seeds, then she's turned her back on the Green Pact.\n\nI'm not sure she can do that and still call herself a greenspeaker.
{{200879108-0-79956:}}I've lived all over Tamriel, and Skingrad is a nice enough city. Always something happening here and we get news from across the continent.\n\nIt wasn't until recently that the people of West Weald started looking askance at Wood Elves.
{{200879108-0-79955:}}When we learned that the Recollection was working with Daedra at Rustwall, it seemed my clearest path forward was to find an expert. Retired adventurer, former Imperial scribe, Recollection scholar.\n\nI probably should have visited Beragon sooner.
{{200879108-0-79954:}}Not exactly. While he agreed to spare a few legionaries to patrol the area, he's reluctant to assign more troops there on a permanent basis. Not after I lost an entire cohort!\n\nHe ordered me to continue my investigation, though, so here I am.
{{200879108-0-79953:}}I wish … I wish my time in the Scholarium had ended differently. Nothing would stop my husband from making his mad bargain. But through you, the art of Scribing will live on.
{{200879108-0-79951:}}I've left behind another sort of guide: the True-Sight Lens. Seek it out in the east wing.\n\nThe lens and the fables are the signposts to seek the Luminaries. And they will teach you far more than I ever could.
{{200879108-0-81285:}}Faithful service to the Legion plus a strong sword arm. I fought in Varen's Rebellion and defended Colovia as the usurper war broke out. After we won the Battle for North Hook, I started moving up the ranks. Now here I am.
{{200879108-0-81286:}}When the usurper war began, the Legion sent me to defend our borders. Colovia has no love for those grasping to be emperor. We didn't want to get dragged into the conflict.\n\nCount Calantius heard about my exploits and brought me into his service.
{{200879108-0-81280:}}Little Erno … so happy, so innocent. We'd pick berries together. For the wine.\n\nEvery day I wish I had died, not him. Not them. But now those who love this elf will know what that pain feels like!
{{200879108-0-80799:}}Well, some clans here hold tight to the Green Pact, but others follow a new path—the Dawnway. They both have merit, but the faithful on either side don't see it that way.\n\nI expect more from Dominion folk than petty arguments!
{{200879108-0-79369:}}A sense that things are going to get worse before they get better. Recollection cultists prowling the region, Daedra boldly attacking the keep, magical blades that open portals as easily as I can open a door.\n\nSomething bigger is coming. I know it.
{{200879108-0-79364:}}Usually I'd leap the railing and rush into battle, but who knows what else that blade can do? I'd rather not be turned into a mudcrab or something.\n\nLet's split up. If we attack her from two sides, we'll split her focus. Then we can take her down.
{{200879108-0-79365:}}Some Oblivion plane? Look, I know as much about Daedra as I do magecraft, which is absolutely nothing. But I've heard these Shardborn mention the place. Maybe that's where they come from.\n\nWe can ask her all about it after we take that blade.
{{200879108-0-79367:}}Go around the side to that gateway across from here. I'll distract the commander, then you attack and grab the blade.\n\nIt's important we do this before she opens another portal. If reinforcements come through, we'll have a bigger fight on our hands.
{{200879108-0-79360:}}Portals under the keep? That's an unexpected tactic. But I'm glad you and the tribune took care of it.\n\nWithout reinforcements, the remaining Daedra shouldn't pose too much of a problem for my legionaries.
{{200879108-0-81165:}}Well, that's good. I knew we could do it. Never doubted it for an instant. I'm glad we won, my friend. And that we're all here to celebrate our victory.\n\nI see Leramil over there. You should go and talk to her. I'll join you in a moment.
{{200879108-0-81164:}}I did what now? I fell into a pit of some sort? And Hermaeus Mora brought—\n\nNo matter. Since this seems to be a celebration, I take it we accomplished … whatever it was we were up to in that ruin?
{{200879108-0-80664:}}A shrewdly impossible riddle, one I cannot solve. And yes, the riddle must have an answer. \n\nYou must understand me, how I think, so that you might craft a riddle I cannot unmake.
{{200879108-0-80662:}}Riddles are a way to explore the way another creature thinks. A stone thrown into the pool of thought. That is your task, the challenge I put before you.\n\nThrow a stone. Construct a clever, devious riddle exclusively for me.
{{200879108-0-78635:}}Chosen of fate, indeed. I should have known that the ripples of consequence reverberating in this region would draw your attention.\n\nWhich site did you visit? What did you find?
{{200879108-0-78634:}}The lines of possibility that weave through reality and hold everything together. Ithelia, the Daedric Prince of Paths, has been set free. Her presence threatens both our world and the realms beyond. Help me meet this threat and you will be rewarded.
{{200879108-0-78636:}}It is an appellation I did not choose for myself. In my youth, I became dissatisfied with the traditional education of an arcanist. I desired knowledge my instructors could not, or would not, provide me.\n\nSo I struck a bargain with the One Who Knows.
{{200879108-0-79249:}}Carvain Manor is south of town, on the Carvain Ranch. Watch yourself there. The ranch hands don't take kindly to trespassers.\n\nAs for Lady Raxalee's tower, it's north of town, looming over the quarry.
{{200879108-0-79233:}}Many of us do. I am loyal to the Legion, of course. But I do what I can to make sure the Order remains well informed about events in Imperial lands.\n\nThe less we speak of that, the better. My comrades would not understand.
{{200879108-0-78630:}}But then why create such an elaborate scene? A fall is simple enough. A tidy portrait. We should continue to investigate this broken window. Perhaps we can find a trail on the other side?
{{200879108-0-79246:}}That I couldn't say. She wasn't exactly eager to share the details of her investigation in the middle of the town gambling den.\n\nBut between you and me, if Carvain and Raxalee aren't guilty of this, they sure as tusk are guilty of something.
{{200879108-0-79796:}}That's exactly right. I'm quite proficient with portals, you see. This was my first time patrolling here in Sunnamere, filling in for a friend. \n\nI sensed a portal through the wall back there, and when we broke through … well.
{{200879108-0-81607:}}Many things, oh many things. Children don't know not to be curious, you see. A timber pig in a truffle den. Geography, politics, the ways of the Green, I'm even a fair hand at cooking when I put my mind to it.
{{200879108-0-81609:}}I have to wear many hats! Hats on hats. We're a small community and we want our children to make good choices. To be ready for the world. \n\nAnd if they choose to leave someday, well … perhaps they will return. And bring the world back with them.
{{200879108-0-78689:}}How could you possibly say that? Whose inane rambling convinced you of such nonsensical drivel. Everyone is out to frame me. Theophan, Otho, even that damned Edric.
{{200879108-0-78680:}}Hermaeus Mora forged the Echonir to reveal memories related to Ithelia. It was one of the relics instrumental in defeating the Forgotten Prince and eliminating any lingering memories.\n\nHopefully, the Echonir can help us in our investigations.
{{200879108-0-78681:}}Hermaeus Mora knew he could not completely erase all knowledge of Ithelia from the world. He locked away his own memories of her in glyphics hidden in Apocrypha. He created the Echonir to reveal any lingering memories of the Forgotten Prince.
{{200879108-0-78683:}}Indeed! Pelena may have sensed an end to her cozy life. Killing Lady Weatherleah before the imposter's arrival would secure her the fortune. She couldn't have known it was hidden, and now she can't reveal the imposter without outing herself.
{{200879108-0-78684:}}They must have brokered an agreement. Ride out the storm of Lady Weatherleah's death and come out the other side rich. But they've stumbled along the way thanks to a curious cook and a meddling Mizzik.\n\nIt's time we confront our killers.
{{200879108-0-78685:}}A poisoned cup of tea would bring unwanted attention to Lady Weatherleah's death. Pelena's only option would have been to stage the scene. A fall from a ladder at the Lady's age? Mizzik can already imagine the solemn nods of acceptance.
{{200879108-0-78686:}}A Daedric Prince? Yes, I remember. That was what mortals called me. But Elenglynn is a proud citadel, not a crumbling ruin. Its people are wise and beautiful. They worship me.\n\nWait. I sense … something. And another memory … Hermaeus Mora.
{{200879108-0-81029:}}I don't trust those ruins. Maybe it's superstition or paranoia, but it felt like there was something ancient and dark lurking in there.\n\nI mean it. If you have anyone who might be willing to watch your back, find them before going in.
{{200879108-0-80047:}}Like many Bosmer, I am acquainted with the heroic tales of Beragon Sharp-Dagger! I spotted him in our town recently and made sure to refresh myself on his exploits. He saved many Bosmer at Ninglenirre, or so I hear.\n\nYou should ask him about it.
{{200879108-0-80048:}}Were you not aware that we stand upon the realms of the Saliache? You may call them Ayleids. They are the ancestors of my people. The ruins all around are not their legacy. No. Their legacy are the Bosmer. Ayleid blood runs through our veins!
{{200879108-0-79665:}}I didn't get a chance to ask them, but that makes the most sense. Unfortunately, all they'll find is the meager payroll for my cohort—unless you can get it first.\n\nJust make sure you grab the proper sequence and ring that damn bell.
{{200879108-0-79667:}}Please, let's hear them! Maybe then we can finish our pilgrimage. There's a comfy inn and a bottle of wine waiting for me in Skingrad.
{{200879108-0-79663:}}Because Anuic and Padomaic forces simultaneously defy and support Molag Bal, he both simultaneously resists and submits to the will of others.\n\nThis then means Molag Bal is either not completely dominant, or is not completely real.
{{200879108-0-79669:}}The price of sapience is resisting things out of our control. That's indeed a sad thing.\n\nI'm not overly fond of Daedra. Their inflexible nature makes them useful only as personifications of abstract concepts. But thank you for this new perspective.
{{200879108-0-81879:}}I'm not sure I can give you a simple answer to that question. Perhaps some of the Luminaries can give you their perspective.\n\nMy best guess? When you see magic the way they do, your taste for the company of mortal mages might sour.
{{200879108-0-81876:}}I'll scour the complex for grimoires and scripts. I've already found quite a few, aided perhaps by that. What's his name, Indrik chap? \n\nI've never been led by a fawn to a trove of ancient secrets before. But it was an exciting experience!
{{200879108-0-81875:}}I've been tasked with facilitating this lost art form you've rediscovered. Scribing, how novel!\n\nAs I understand it, you will be contacting and convincing these Luminary creatures, empowering the altar and all that.
{{200879108-0-79724:}}You really are new. The baron owns Carvain Ranch, which feeds most of West Weald. This fatigue fever, as it has come to be known, is a burden on business, but you can't toss a disease in the dungeon.\n\nIf there is nothing else, good day to you.
{{200879108-0-79725:}}Constable Ulbren's daughter? Look, if this is about that conversation I had with Yabren's father, I must have been mistaken. I don't know anything about the illness, other than I've lost more quarriers lately than I can replace.
{{200879108-0-81612:}}You could never understand the deep well of sadness that lives inside me, spilling out in my tears. It's ineffable. An abyss so large, I fear it'll swallow me whole.\n\nThat is to say, I don't really know.
{{200879108-0-81179:}}One Mizzik Thunderboots. It's an odd name for an investigator, don't you think? Doesn't inspire a sense of discretion. Although, if what he says is true, he knew my aunt. If she trusted him then so can I.
{{200879108-0-81473:}}No, don't say another word. If the Legion comes to investigate, the less I know, the better.\n\nI'll hire extra protection for the grounds, though. Sentry Helvius could use the help, at least until we clear out the rest of those vampires.
{{200879108-0-81472:}}People talk. If Fennorian abandoning me taught me anything, it's that everyone loves a scandal. I've gone through enough of that to know such things always turn in my favor. Just wait and see.
{{200879108-0-80966:}}You aren't? But I saw you talking to her—the other me. The one that wanted to hurt me!
{{200879108-0-80964:}}You know me, but I don't know you! I'd love to share a drink and see how well you hold your ale, but I seem to have run dry.\n\nWest Weald Wallop is the best drink in this place. Fetch me a cask and we can sit and talk for as long as you like.
{{200879108-0-78624:}}Yes. She was lying on the floor, motionless. One of the ladders had fallen and there were books scattered all around. I can take you to see the library. Everything is as I found it.
{{200879108-0-81615:}}I don't really know. I just started running, looking for a place to hide. I didn't think anyone would find me here, but then you came, so I just kept going deeper and deeper until the spiders caught me.
{{200879108-0-79044:}}Indeed. I'd heard tales that the Last King's five devoted retainers gathered here prior to his demise. The Emblem of the Last King is sure to be here, protected by the traps set by these five loyal retainers.
{{200879108-0-79047:}}We press on! The renowned Narsis Dren is not deterred by mundane challenges! Let's find this altar they mentioned. And keep your eyes out for any bottles, vials, or carafes they have excavated.
{{200879108-0-79041:}}Most people do not bear the responsibility of preserving reality itself. If we guess wrong about what we must do, or simply fail to do it, disaster ensues.\n\nI do not like to leave such decisions to chance when the stakes are so high.
{{200879108-0-81614:}}I suppose that's all right. But please, don't make me stay down here any longer than I have to.
{{200879108-0-81685:}}When I am not at prayer, yes. At present, I hear the music of Dibella. The toil of Zenithar and the winds of Kynareth. When their sounds are stilled, I will be ready to take on all challengers.
{{200879108-0-78877:}}The loggers found the shrine while clearing the area. It's apparently very old.\n\nI don't care much for Daedric Princes, but if restoring your lamp will help defeat Ithelia, I'm all for it.
{{200879108-0-78876:}}Boethiah created Abolisher, so it stands to reason that a forge built to honor her might be able to restore it.\n\nMaster blacksmiths dedicated the forge back when Daedric worship was more widespread. It became a kwama mine much more recently.
{{200879108-0-78583:}}Yes. And the creatures that lived within it. Driven wild and feral. I did what I could to calm them. Tend to their fear. I had hoped to take them with me. To return the favor and save them from this mess. But I acted too late.
{{200879108-0-78582:}}Tell him what you will. I'm certain the scandal won't take long to spread. The Verdulis family's wild child finally making for the hills. I only wish I'd done it sooner. And that I could see my mother's face when she realizes what's happened.
{{200879108-0-78580:}}This cave was once a sanctuary from my parents. Before this wild magic twisted it into something cruel, it was my second home. Filled with beasts with softer smiles than the ones that raised me.
{{200879108-0-78585:}}Ah, apologies. I mistook you for a Valente servant.\n\nLord Valente is clever, and if the wine accomplishes a fraction of what he claims, the waiting will have been worth it. But I would prefer to simply buy what I want and not deal with an auction.
{{200879108-0-81448:}}It's very old. Ancient, even. One of the first things the Prince of Paths ever created. And it's big!\n\nHow it got to the ruins of Ceyond, I have no idea. But it's there and we can use it—provided you can defeat it and bring back one of its shards.
{{200879108-0-81618:}}Not really, no. Nantharion has proven to be a liar, but the Dawnway is bigger than one man. I trust Minth, I trust Vashabar. I trust myself.\n\nNantharion may be false. But we'll find our own truth without him.
{{200879108-0-81561:}}I do not think reality is endangered by Ithelia's travels, but by her choices. Whatever she decides to do, reality must accommodate her. It will shatter in the attempt.\n\nThe threat of her next decision causes fate to now fray.
{{200879108-0-81560:}}Ask away, pretty face. But don't take too long, my cup is still empty.
{{200879108-0-81563:}}Because life's too short not to be, silly! \n\nWhat do I have to worry about? I've got all the ale I could want, a gorgeous stranger is chatting me up, and my tab's not due—not yet, anyway. Things have never been better!
{{200879108-0-81569:}}When I was released, I learned my husband had been killed in a skirmish in Reaper's March. Not only did I lose the chance to see Regomor grow—he'd been left to fend for himself for years.\n\nNo wonder he doesn't want me around Noraine.
{{200879108-0-81568:}}I've been supervising the outdoor staff since Leovic was a cub! Gardeners, masons, they all answer to me. No easy job, especially when we're all frightened out of our wits.\n\nI know Rustwall inside and out. Made it easy to find a spot to hide my key.
{{200879108-0-82474:}}She disappeared into the nearby Fyrelight Cave. Adventurer, if you can recover my four dowry bundles, I promise to make it worth your while. Every scrap of silk and muddied jewel could save me from becoming the laughingstock of Skingrad.
{{200879108-0-82473:}}One masked brigand and the pack of horrid beasts she commanded! Fralgatha did everything she could to protect me, bless her heart, but the thief made off with my entire dowry. Now I haven't a napkin ring to present to my future bride.
{{200879108-0-80208:}}Torvesard used Abolisher to open the way to Ithelia's prison. He knows the relics can be used to return her there and will do anything to prevent that. These ancient tools may be the keys to saving West Weald. And perhaps all of reality.
{{200879108-0-80551:}}A place of learning and an archive of knowledge. Beneath the roots of many a small village in Valenwood you'll find libraries, just like ours.\n\nThe darkness and cool air keeps the scrolls preserved, just like wine. They get more precious with age.
{{200879108-0-80557:}}As I understand it, the Outcast Inn was an unremarkable establishment prior to this. In Skingrad, I learned that a new owner purchased it recently and had started to make repairs.\n\nI know little else. Perhaps anyone you find inside can tell you more.
{{200879108-0-80556:}}Cause and effect shape our entire reality. Even magicka has a known source. Mundus exists as a cascading series of actions and outcomes, though sometimes we cannot perceive either.\n\nThe event within this tangle of fates decouples the two.
{{200879108-0-80555:}}Yes, Hermaeus Mora. Daedric Prince of Secrets and Forbidden Knowledge. In exchange for such knowledge, I often act as his agent in the mortal realm.\n\nMost recently, I was tasked to assist you in ending the danger posed by Ithelia.
{{200879108-0-80554:}}My arrangement with the One Who Knows gives me vision beyond most mortals. I perceive the threads of fate that flow through reality. With this vision comes responsibility.\n\nAs for you, fate has chosen you as its champion in these matters.
{{200879108-0-81738:}}I can, of course. But too much guidance and this exercise would be well and truly academic. Wouldn't it?
{{200879108-0-81739:}}Each of us judges a mortal's worth on our own terms. I have no interest in your ability to steal daffodils or stab Daedra. Or whatever it is the others care about.\n\nRiddles are a way to observe your mastery of the mind. My domain.
{{200879108-0-81730:}}Hmm. What is the shape of your mind? I'm eager to see. I hope to learn about you by what you deem worthy of asking.
{{200879108-0-79531:}}What does Lee's being over there have to do with anything? Oh. Wait, we're talking about the manor. Got you.\n\nI'll start making my way there. Unless I fall. I hate falling.
{{200879108-0-79530:}}Violent Vineyards? Yes this wine has been violent. I'm gonna head off, then. Bye.
{{200879108-0-79532:}}I dunno. Orcs have to watch themselves when visiting with Wood Elves. The Bosmer eat meat by twelves including that of yourselves.\n\nThat was the nursery rhyme I learned. But what the hay. I'm headed straight to Vashabar.
{{200879108-0-79537:}}I never even thought to ask him. Brilliant. Go tell the loving couple.\n\nIn the meantime I'll gather Minth and Nedolir, as many others as I can. If Laeni and Clendagal are going to ask the village to decide, we need the whole village to be present.
{{200879108-0-82040:}}Possibilities, probabilities, places where fate takes a different course. Some lead to here, others to there. And a few, they lead to … elsewhere.\n\nBut this place. It has something I need.
{{200879108-0-82045:}}Leramil calls you the proxy or the chosen of fate. Apparently, you agreed to help Hermaeus Mora defeat Ithelia and preserve reality. When you met her in Elenglynn and the Outcast Inn, she seemed confused, disoriented.\n\nWhat she wants, I couldn't say.
{{200879108-0-80907:}}There's one thing that might lift my spirits. Whenever I was sad as a little girl, I'd collect pretty blue flowers by the river's edge to weave into a crown.\n\nI saw the same blue flowers nearby, but I don't have the strength to gather them.
{{200879108-0-80908:}}The Wood Elves aren't going to pack up and return to Valenwood, if that's what you're asking. Nantharion was wrong about many things, but there's room for Bosmer in West Weald. I think their Colovian neighbors will come to see that, too.
{{200879108-0-80909:}}You did that for me? Maybe there is still some kindness in the world.\n\nAh, these blooms are beautiful. The dark clouds in my mind are parting a little. I feel lighter.
{{200879108-0-81640:}}A Daedra barking orders to those Recollection fanatics. Never heard of a shardmarshal before, but I assume it's some sort of rank.\n\nEvery new thing we learn just leads to more mysteries. It's damn infuriating!
{{200879108-0-80889:}}We don't want to go, damn it! We're so proud of the clan, of this huge chance we took moving across the River Strid.\n\nBut I love that woman! I want to stand in front of the village, pronounce that love, and drink rotmeth till we're all sick.
{{200879108-0-79815:}}Not even close. But today's arguments were the last leaf to fall. \n\nThis has gone on long enough. Laeni and I have been together for years, and we've wanted to be married almost as long.
{{200879108-0-81898:}}I was already old when Ulfsild and I first spoke, centuries ago. I have lived the length of many mortal lives.\n\nTo see such a young, beautiful creature on the verge of oblivion … I acted without thinking. A mistake, in the end.
{{200879108-0-81897:}}Truth is a form of power, mortal. And the truth is that I have made poor decisions, just as you have. One of the things that binds us together, I suppose. \n\nThe gods want us to learn by doing. And failure is a very instructive teacher.
{{200879108-0-78989:}}Helping people in dangerous situations sounds just like Beragon. Can't fault him for accepting help.\n\nI asked him to join me in Ostumir because I found something amazing. Miraculous, even. He needs to see it for himself.
{{200879108-0-78988:}}They are all within West Weald, not far from the city of Skingrad. Which location are you curious about?
{{200879108-0-80017:}}Has all record of her accomplishments been lost? Not a footnote remains of her life and deeds?\n\nHer discovery of the Luminaries began long before she met and wed Archmage Shalidor. Though their collaboration would encompass the work of a lifetime.
{{200879108-0-78985:}}We need to gather the items used for the spell, remove them from the ritual site, and burn any corrupted corpses we find. We should also destroy the undead lurking in the ruins. Their souls cannot move on until their bodies are laid to rest.
{{200879108-0-80015:}}We are. But don't get your feathers in a ruffle. The Scholarium was shielded from mages, Princes, and powers long ago.\n\nTime has not been kind to Ulfsild's library, but those protective wards still stand strong.
{{200879108-0-80012:}}They are beings of pure magic, hence their name. Utterly unique, like beams of light emanating from the face of Magnus himself.\n\nEach has chosen a shape that suits their personality, following goals and interests entirely of their own choosing.
{{200879108-0-80013:}}We are beneath an island called Eyevea. In ages past Eyevea was a sanctuary for magic, founded by Ulfsild's husband. Archmagus Shalidor. \n\nI am caretaker to this space, Ulfsild's familiar. Set to watch over it when the island was lost.
{{200879108-0-80011:}}Like a ray of sunlight from Magnus himself. Yes, Scribing is an art developed by Archmage Ulfsild in collaboration with powerful beings, spirits if you like.\n\nThey are called the Luminaries of magic. And you, adventurer, are going to seek them out.
{{200879108-0-80991:}}Not in any way your mortal mind would understand. I do not wish to drive you mad.\n\nAn analogy, perhaps. Picture a diamond that somehow formed around a spiderweb. Interweaving lines within a grander, fixed shape. That is the Many Paths.
{{200879108-0-80996:}}She always claimed Ayleid land belonged to the Wood Elves. But that was purely academic before. Sounds like the Recollection promised to make it real. Could be why they wanted the wildburn seed.\n \nSpeaking of which, did you get it?
{{200879108-0-80994:}}One of the maps indicated that there was a door out of the ruins in this chamber somewhere. That is what Keshargo hopes you will find.
{{200879108-0-78730:}}Certainly. I made a promise to these people. Leftwheal provides opportunities for all those within its walls. I won't let a band of cultists get in the way of progress. I hope you can see all that we have to offer one day.
{{200879108-0-78732:}}I believe we witnessed the moment Hermaeus Mora first confronted Ithelia about the danger she posed to reality … and we saw that she refused to heed him.\n\nIt is a hard thing for any creature to change its nature. Especially for a Daedric Prince.
{{200879108-0-78733:}}We examined the locations where the threads of fate were most frayed and learned more about Ithelia and the Recollection.\n\nLet us next rendezvous at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad. I wish to consult with him about our discoveries.
{{200879108-0-80290:}}Indeed. Ulfsild gathered hundreds of tomes in her search for these tales. A small handful of her annotated volumes will be needed to find the Luminaries. \n\nBeyond the Indrik, you will seek them out in whatever order you choose.
{{200879108-0-80291:}}I have no idea. I dimly recall seeing that turn of phrase somewhere before. A translation of an old Ayleid name, maybe. But where the Darkened Home is and what's there, I couldn't say.
{{200879108-0-80294:}}Ulfsild felt a kinship with him. He was the first of the Luminaries to ally with the Archmage, and the first to commit his power to the altar.\n\nIf any of these unorthodox beings are still loyal to Ulfsild, I felt he would be the one.
{{200879108-0-80740:}}Watch your back in Vassir-Didanat if you head that way. The place is full of ruffians and cutthroats. Stealing a bunch of supplies from merchants is tame for them.\n\nI'm surprised they didn't gut them for fun.
{{200879108-0-80741:}}Hmm. If you're going to be fishing in Vvardenfell, make sure you have bait. If you don't have the right bait for the right water, you won't catch a thing.\n\nI used to live near a lake. Fished almost every day. I miss the quiet.
{{200879108-0-80744:}}I'd do that West Weald one, personally. I know plenty of people who left Valenwood with King Nantharion that I'd like to keep safe.
{{200879108-0-80745:}}I try to stay buoyant, I do. If we are to brush the ground it should be for good reason.\n\nA father breathes his last in Vvardenfell, at a clinic in the town of Suran. He has regrets to resolve before his soul becomes untethered and drifts away.
{{200879108-0-81501:}}As I hoped, your account explains these last few marks on the Hoperoot map. Not only were the inn and the keep noted, there's another site the Recollection's interested in—an Ayleid ruin called Niryastare.\n\nWe need to investigate that ruin next.
{{200879108-0-81837:}}Always! Making drinks is like alchemy, and I like taking care of strangers. I finally found someone who believed in me. Millie. She suggested I buy this place and provided some of the funds.\n\nI need to keep this place open. Honor her belief in me.
{{200879108-0-80930:}}I haven't had a chance to examine them yet. All I can tell you is that they're very disturbing, the way they shred fates before they're born. And they're growing more powerful.\n\nSo, if you could get a move on, maybe we can do something about them.
{{200879108-0-79985:}}I need to conduct tests, make a detailed study. But if I had to guess … I think it carries a whiff of Daedric magic. Which could explain the unprecedented explosion of energy. And the area of devastation along the border—the wildburn.
{{200879108-0-81828:}}That's Count Calantius's estate. It's just east of Skingrad.\n\nIt's a beautiful location. As I understand it, the count uses it as a retreat from the duties of his court, and as lodging for important guests. I'm still waiting for my invitation.
{{200879108-0-81829:}}Imagine swinging a blade but it refuses to slice through the air. Or a guar suddenly appearing overhead and falling on a person. Or, worse, a town erupting into flames without a single spark being struck.\n\nLife would become untenable.
{{200879108-0-81566:}}I don't blame Regomor for his anger toward me. I saw him so rarely when he was small. And after we deserted the Legion, I kept my distance. Living with a mother who steals from caravans isn't any kind of life for a child.
{{200879108-0-81831:}}I don't know her from a skeever's arse and I don't care what her name is. But she's absolutely the cause of my problems. Right after she arrived, the sky changed and those shadows started roaming my inn. \n\nThen she sat by the fire without a word.
{{200879108-0-81037:}}Nocturnal can shape the night. So spooky! As they roam, the spirits of Evergloam gather up that shadowstuff. \n\nSome of them have even gathered enough to make a snarl of creatia! That's what we're after, here. Shadowy creatia.
{{200879108-0-81036:}}Yes! You're so smart. Just search through other chests of treasure till you find the spellforged key. \n\nOh! And don't lick the fiery creatia. I made that mistake once and my tongue was numb for a month!
{{200879108-0-80846:}}More than that. It is rumored that the knot allows whoever wields it to cross from one reality to the next. \n\nThis expedition is not the first to try to take the arcane knot. But in all the eons of attempts, there have been no successes.
{{200879108-0-80122:}}I'm one of Narsis Dren's devoted personal assistants. Perhaps the most devoted. I compile his research, organize his travel plans, and transcribe his notes. I'm proud to serve such a gifted explorer.
{{200879108-0-79299:}}How could you tell? Of course, you're a lycanthrope, too! I was so lost in thought I nearly missed your scent. Nice to meet you!
{{200879108-0-79290:}}The lengths the cook went to protect Lady Weatherleah. This one hopes she knew how dearly she was loved by her staff.\n\nThere is no doubt left in this one's mind as to who our killer is.
{{200879108-0-79746:}}Well, not quite. While Hermaeus Mora appreciates everything you've done as fate's chosen, he told me he wants to speak to you one last time. Whenever is convenient, of course.\n\nSo mingle, talk to your allies. Then look for my master's portal.
{{200879108-0-79744:}}Isn't that the nature of lawkeepers? To see a crime behind every event, guilt as the source of every motivation?\n\nBaron Carvain ordered me to cooperate, as long as it didn't interfere with the business of the ranch.
{{200879108-0-79749:}}No. Consider that my parting gift to you. You and I shall remember Ithelia and her scions. The glory of Mirrormoor. A reality that could have been.\n\nNow the contract between us is concluded. Return to your world with the thanks of the One Who Knows.
{{200879108-0-80460:}}We can't hide down here forever. Now we know how Marcan Caelum operates. He lures out his victims and strikes when they're alone. We won't give him that chance again.\n\nBesides … I caused all this. I have to be the one to end it.
{{200879108-0-80468:}}An intriguing notion. She saw other versions of herself. Is there a way to get her to see that and attempt to change her own perspective?\n\nWe must consult Scruut. This shall require all of our combined knowledge if such a possibility truly exists.
{{200879108-0-80388:}}Really? I'd pay all that gold and more to see the look on Laurina's face when she finds it missing! But it might be better not to stick around for too long.\n\nI owe you one, stranger.
{{200879108-0-80575:}}Well, Tribune Alea crept back to the gate. She's waiting for you there. She lures away the sentries. Then we run up and enter when they chase her! \n\nWhich sounds ridiculous when I say it out loud.
{{200879108-0-78415:}}In the short time we've had to observe the Recollection, we've rarely seen more than a single leader in any given location. To learn of a meeting between four of them, that's an opportunity we can't let slip away.
{{200879108-0-79356:}}The most immediate threat is that they're slipping in all over the keep. I need to contain them in one spot if I'm going to bring my forces to bear.\n\nIf we slow their progress and cut off their entry points, they'll regroup at the breach in the wall.
{{200879108-0-78349:}}Another assault on Apocrypha? The Great Eye still hasn't recovered from the last one!\n\nWe already knew that Ithelia had transformed into the monster Hermaeus Mora warned us about. I don't suppose you and Leramil have come up with a way to stop her?
{{200879108-0-78348:}}Of course he does. But his faith in his Prince has made him blind to the danger she poses to existence itself. These tears are spreading. Soon the fabric of reality may be too damaged to repair. We must find Ithelia before that happens.
{{200879108-0-78341:}}Aside from the necromancers, you mean? Strictly speaking, these ruins are minotaur territory. The Goblins tunneled their way in somehow and the minotaurs put up with them for some reason.\n\nOh, there are Ayleid traps, too. Watch out for those.
{{200879108-0-78340:}}I've been putting off testing it. There's no such thing as a good day to steal precious Aetherial energy from an Ayleid ruin guarded by minotaurs. And now, necromancers? It's the worst day for it.\n\nUntil you came along. It'll work! I'm sure of it.
{{200879108-0-78345:}}Why, do you think I'd make a good one?\n\nKidding! Kidding. Can you imagine? Me. A necromancer. Wandering Tamriel with other necromancers. Killing anyone who displeases us. Raising them to do our bidding. Ahh, what a sight.
{{200879108-0-78344:}}Now it's back to Master Lucianos in Skingrad. Back to measuring herb sachets and transcribing his correspondence.\n\nSuppose I'll keep wondering what those necromancers were up to. If these shards might have helped them in whatever they were doing.
{{200879108-0-79126:}}Not a one. But a good innkeep can guess what a customer needs, and she needs a drink. Something to wake her up—a Skyrim Sunrise.\n\nI can't leave my patrons with these shadows, though. Could you go to the well and fetch some water? You'll drink free.
{{200879108-0-79127:}}All good innkeepers know when to leave someone alone and when to chat them up. If not for these shadows floating around, I'd let the woman have her privacy by the fire.\n\nAlso, there's something about her that frightens me.
{{200879108-0-79124:}}I don't know her from a skeever's arse. But she's absolutely the cause of my problems. Right after she arrived, the sky changed and those shadows started roaming my inn. \n\nThen she sat by the fire without a word.
{{200879108-0-79128:}}Oh, dear. Should I wait here? Should we go after him? I don't want him to think I believe he needs constant oversight, but he does get so wrapped up in his work.
{{200879108-0-80863:}}I doubt they know it exists. Both of them came in to read the texts on occasion, but they live busy lives. The past is not Laeni's focus, and Clendagal's mind drifts to much more ancient days.
{{200879108-0-80862:}}Of course. It is an ancient rite, rarely practiced today. From a time when the supporting branches and vines of culture and custom could, on occasion, strangle new growth in its bed.\n\nThe people of Valenwood have progressed since then. Somewhat.
{{200879108-0-80865:}}Without a doubt. Nedolir is a respected greenspeaker and Minth a key member of the Dawnway. They invoke the meaning and weight of our culture every time they open their mouths.\n\nIf their children invoke a Valenwood rite, they will listen.
{{200879108-0-80864:}}The couple had no plans to leave until now. If Nedolir and Minth are superseded by the rite and their children wed, those two will not be pleased. But they'll listen to the will of the village.\n\nDesperate times call for obscure rites, as it were.
{{200879108-0-79467:}}Easy enough … aye, I'll do it. But look, Laeni and Clendagal deserve love and their village both. \n\nCan you go talk to those old goats? Tell them their children plan to leave? Maybe that will make them finally see reason.
{{200879108-0-79466:}}Hmm. How can you …? Ah! I have just the thing. Take these. I brewed up a few casks of jagga earlier this week. \n\nOffer them a drink and maybe they'll be more inclined to listen. I'll be over by the stables when you're done.
{{200879108-0-79460:}}I don't know the first thing about necromancy!\n\nEven if I wanted to learn, it's not like I could just run into those ruins asking someone to teach me. Not like there's any of them left alive in there.
{{200879108-0-80855:}}Count Calantius gave me his favorite treat. The bear's favorite, I mean, not the count's. Mudcrab apple fritters. Take them, feed them to Burnbiscuit, and he'll follow you back here. Hurry! And watch out for that troll!
{{200879108-0-79469:}}It's a bit more dangerous than the last one. I need to get it just right. May take longer, but we'll get it eventually. \n\nBut thank you for all you've done for us. These little guys have been rolling in treats. And I've been rolling in fame.
{{200879108-0-79468:}}Oh yes. We have to up the ante now. Need to give them a bit of—bam! And then a little bit of—ooh! \n\nYou know how the masses are. They always want to be wowed.
{{200879108-0-81907:}}Ulfsild created the True-Sight Lens as she developed the art of Scribing. \n\nFrom a young age she could see magic in a way few others could. This intuitive understanding of magic was what led her to the Luminaries, and inspired Scribing itself.
{{200879108-0-81906:}}After this beating? Who can say. Daedra don't behave in any rational way that I ever noticed.\n\nBut we'll shore up the barricades, rebuild the wall. And there's always my tried and true methods—fire and traps! Always go with proven tactics, I say.
{{200879108-0-81905:}}It was a reconnaissance report to the Recollection leaders. Contained all kinds of information about Feldagard Keep. The kind of information you collect before launching an attack.\n\nI assumed I'd find Recollection forces here, but they send Daedra.
{{200879108-0-81904:}}Obstinate to a fault. He's convinced he's the shield behind which we might all find safety. And look where that got him. \n\nHis little friend is far more intriguing, strange little beast that he is.
{{200879108-0-81903:}}What can I say that encapsulates the experience that is the Netch? It follows its own currents as it floats through life. \n\nMeans well, truly. And attempts to see joyful things done in the world. Just insists on doing them in its own … netchy way.
{{200879108-0-81902:}}The term itself was chosen by Ulfsild, you understand. None of us thought of ourselves as particularly … radiant before our work with the Archmage brought us together.\n\nAside from myself, the Luminaries are the Netch, the Gryphon, and the Dragon.
{{200879108-0-81901:}}She craves mysteries, mind puzzles, and riddles. Hoards them as a real dragon might, there in her mind. \n\nAlways on the lookout for a new prize to add to her collection.
{{200879108-0-81900:}}The act of Scribing is really quite simple. You focus your will, put ink to parchment, and scrawl your soul upon the page. You change the magic, and the magic changes you. \n\nFocus your intent and fire becomes frost, venom becomes shock.
{{200879108-0-81909:}}Seeing and understanding are two different things, interloper.\n\nThe lens was a tool, a high branch to give her a bird's eye view of impressions left behind by the Luminaries.
{{200879108-0-80801:}}It's the ancient heritage of the Wild Elves, the Ayleids. They worked with natural materials in the forest, picking fruit from trees and harvesting the wood sometimes. I don't see a problem with it, but it's caused quite a stir.
{{200879108-0-81716:}}She did? I'm saddened. And … surprised. They were very much in love. \n\nThey always knew they would not see the end together, but I doubt either of them expected things would end like that.
{{200879108-0-81717:}}Ask each Luminary what they are, where they came from, or how they came to be and they'll each give you a different answer.\n\nMy suggestion is that you meet them, learn all you can, and decide the answer to that question for yourself.
{{200879108-0-80118:}}Nary a day passes when he is not off on some new adventure. I admire that in him, always eager to move on to the next challenge, to the next wondrous historical site. I sometimes wish he would settle down, but life with him is always exciting.
{{200879108-0-81715:}}Shalidor was one of the greatest mages to walk the face of Nirn. He planned to live until the Aedra themselves wrested him from this world.\n\nBut Ulfsild didn't want to live forever. She wanted to leave behind a legacy. Now, thanks to you, she will.
{{200879108-0-81711:}}Perhaps … perhaps not. I am unsure. But nothing can be done while the fabric of reality remains tattered and torn. Talk to Scruut and let us see what comes next.
{{200879108-0-81718:}}Yes. Goes by the name of Beragon. He was a scribe for the Imperial hierarchy back when the Empire was still a functioning entity. I understand he's looking into the Recollection as well.\n\nMight be good to have a chat with him. Compare notes.
{{200879108-0-82016:}}I spent a lot of time with the Gryphon while he was frozen. But not all the time. He wasn't holding up his end of conversations.\n\nI would kind of take myself on walks, and I learned a lot over the years. Like, well, what raw creatia smells like.
{{200879108-0-80210:}}We observed Torvesard using Abolisher to open portals. Creating a portal is not difficult and I am rather proficient at it myself. But Abolisher appears to do it swiftly and with great precision.\n\nI suspect it can destroy them, as well.
{{200879108-0-80211:}}The Lamp allows us to gaze into the Many Paths. Think of that as a halo of possibilities and alternate fates that surrounds our own reality. Things can be real in the Many Paths that are not real here.\n\nWe may need it to confront Ithelia.
{{200879108-0-80212:}}That remains to be seen, proxy. We have observed the effects of Abolisher and the Lamp firsthand. The Skein, however, has been hidden for thousands of years. I presume its function will become apparent once you recover it.
{{200879108-0-80213:}}We parted ways long ago. I had one close call too many in ruins like these, so I decided to retire and take up a safer vocation. We said our farewells in Skingrad.\n\nIt's ironic. I'm falling into dangerous habits again.
{{200879108-0-80214:}}We hoped to find some treasure overlooked by other explorers. The vault door certainly seemed promising, but the welkynd apparatus stopped us here. Niryastare's undead forced us to retreat before we could figure out how to get past it.
{{200879108-0-80215:}}She'd be fine if those Goblins weren't out here. One of them just attacked me, you can see its body there! The goblins are the problem and Jerntann's hunters are the solution. I know it.
{{200879108-0-80216:}}Oh by Malacath, just tell me.
{{200879108-0-80676:}}When the Dragon gave me her trial, I was in the midst of research on the origins of the Luminaries. These ideas mingled in ways I couldn't imagine. \n\nAnswer a riddle, though I cannot hear what you say. What can you give and receive, but never borrow?
{{200879108-0-81671:}}Ask away, inheritor. No more secrets, not for this bird.
{{200879108-0-81675:}}You and Nahlia are committed to the continuation of Ulfsild's work. The Luminaries are safe and happy.\n\nAnd we're in a library filled with life and laughter. That sounds like destiny to me.
{{200879108-0-81674:}}I won't wing off and leave her to fend for herself, not after all this. But I just might do some flying once she's settled. \n\nI feel quite sane for someone cooped up for centuries? But it would be nice to get out and see the world Ulfsild remembered.
{{200879108-0-81677:}}We were embarrassed, to say the least. But there wasn't time to develop the ritual to her normal exacting standards.\n\nPerhaps it was fate. After all, who knows if Nahlia would have ever found the Scholarium if not for that chaotic energy?
{{200879108-0-81676:}}I first met you and Nahlia, if you recall, when she smashed the focusing crystal on the altar. Not the best first impression. \n\nJokes aside, I gave myself this sacred charge. A destiny to live out. I felt I had to be cautious.
{{200879108-0-79861:}}The Daedric Princes Vaermina and Peryite. Torvesard convinced them Mora had stolen their memories, too. Together they invaded Apocrypha and reached the glyphics in which Mora kept the secret—there was another Daedric Prince, Ithelia.
{{200879108-0-79860:}}I thought you would be familiar with that sobriquet. Apologies. I refer to Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge. I serve as his agent in the mortal world from time to time in exchange for secrets I can learn nowhere else.
{{200879108-0-80981:}}If I knew the answer to that, do you think I would be here? \n\nDaedric magic is tricky at best, and the magic in West Weald is particularly volatile. I must have pushed my experiment too far and shattered some element binding the spell together.
{{200879108-0-80984:}}They bloom in my shadow. Or in the shadows of other Ithelias. Each path's ingredient is unique. You can find tirum weed here, but the rest grows in other realities.\n\nTake what you need, pathwalker. Then you must leave before my fellow Princes arrive.
{{200879108-0-80985:}}Maps are better for giving ideas on layouts and routes, not enemies. This one could not tell you what waits in those timeworn halls. \n\nBut—given the age of the documents and the name—Keshargo suspects there will be difficult terrain.
{{200879108-0-80986:}}If I am to lend you my strength, if you are to master Scribing, you must complete for me a boon. It's a tradition, at this point. \n\nYou have been as a shield for those that need it. Now the Fox and I want you to protect those closer to home.
{{200879108-0-82012:}}There's a lot of fire, and Dremora soldiers, and … ash. That's about it. I've only been there a few times because it's only either boring or terrifying with almost nothing in between. \n\nLet's just hope we don't draw much attention.
{{200879108-0-78902:}}I know exactly why he became the Terror and returned to Sutch. It's because of me. He hated it when I left. When I turned away from the blood and the gold.\n\nI plan to make him pay for what he did here. To send him to Oblivion minus his head.
{{200879108-0-78901:}}He did. Made more coin serving drinks than I ever did robbing travelers with the gang. I suppose the current occupants of Sutch prefer their drinks a bit more crimson than anything Tham poured.\n\nHe wrote to me. Told me Balandrus had returned.
{{200879108-0-78900:}}Sutch benefits from its location near the Gold Road and the nearby mines. In my early days with the gang, we worked out of the town. Watched for traders and caravans. That's when I got to know Tham. He was one of the good ones.
{{200879108-0-81780:}}We let Beragon carry out his plan. And we remember what we have accomplished in our time together. We defeated three Princes—Peryite, Vaermina, and Ithelia. We saved Necrom. We saved West Weald. We saved Apocrypha.\n\nWe have … done well.
{{200879108-0-81783:}}I don't. Not any more. But I used to idolize her. Did everything I could to help her lead our squadron.\n\nOnce the fighting stopped and I had a moment, I composed my report. To explain what happened here. I left it over there, but you can take it.
{{200879108-0-78275:}}That's hardly a reason not to get married. My parents built a lumber empire despite hating each other. Of course, without my dowry, none of this matters. Not to press, but even a small portion returned could save my marriage.
{{200879108-0-80972:}}I'll send for more legionaries to clear them out. As many as we can spare. With the portal closed and Shardmarshal Vargas on the run, they shouldn't pose too much of a problem.
{{200879108-0-81937:}}Hmm. I might have to. I'll need help rounding up the rest of the mercenaries at the ranch and the quarry. Damn it, there's a lot to do before I can figure out what's next for me.\n\nIf you wander this way again, know that Ontus will always welcome you.
{{200879108-0-81934:}}In the inn, my power surged but I could not control it. Here, it feels distant, like there is a conflict. As if my power does not know to join me … or to join another.\n\nI must try to resolve this. You go on. I shall join you when I can.
{{200879108-0-81935:}}That's a good question. I haven't quite decided yet. I want to stick around long enough to wrap this all up. See Carvain and Raxalee face justice. Help decide the future of the ranch and quarry.\n\nBeyond that? We'll just have to see.
{{200879108-0-81932:}}Ingredients to create the drink grow in the shadow of all Ithelias. The drink blends our essences, connecting us. Each path grows a different ingredient. \n\nThat must be why I crave one. I need to reconnect with the other Ithelias to reclaim my power.
{{200879108-0-81259:}}I'm fairly new to Leftwheal. I sold potions and artisan crafts at a stall near the town square. I wasn't filling the coffers per se, but it was good business and I met a great number of folks doing it. I hope everyone made it out safely.
{{200879108-0-81933:}}Oh, sure. You'll find these old ruins all across Colovia. The first owner built the inn on top of some. Whoever dug out the cellar broke through into ruins and just left it that way.\n\nI use it for storage now.
{{200879108-0-81931:}}It was created by the Daedric Prince Azura. She made the relic to find me. One of my powers is to avoid the gaze of other Princes, but they found a way around that.\n\nThe Lamp contains a spark of Azura, which reveals these paths to us for some reason.
{{200879108-0-81254:}}The unimaginable. Can you contemplate what happens when reality shreds like parchment beneath a sabre cat's claws? Nothing remains when existence ceases to be.
{{200879108-0-79211:}}So you're Yabren's new deputy? Good. She could use the help. I'm not sure I could come back and dive into work after losing someone as close as Yabren was to her father.\n\nWhat can I tell you, deputy?
{{200879108-0-78679:}}Indeed. I sense an ancient Daedric shrine in these ruins, although I have no idea which Prince it honors. If we find the shrine, we may uncover the Recollection's purpose here.\n\nDo you still have the Echonir, proxy?
{{200879108-0-78678:}}Edric is dead? I can't believe it. No, he'd never hurt Lady Weatherleah. We were like a family.\n\nWait, the recipe for the Lady's tea is wrong. She's always found ginger to be too overwhelming. Are you sure Edric wrote this?
{{200879108-0-80394:}}Fool of an assistant! Do not disturb me or I'll have you demoted to a footnote in my next book! You stumbled through much, and now your reward is to watch me finally grasp the Emblem of the Last King!
{{200879108-0-80391:}}Safe from what? A mysterious murderer? Who's to say whether Hooke is jumping at shadows? I'm sorry some old comrades are dead, but thieves die every day. If it's my time, it's my time.\n\nFeh. Don't worry. I'll make it to Skingrad.
{{200879108-0-80399:}}We fought side-by-side at North Hook. He was brave, but never foolish. Always took every engagement seriously. A lot of soldiers would be dead right now if not for him.\n\nWhen I received command of the cohort, I requested he join me.
{{200879108-0-79980:}}We should question the imposter, but we mustn't let on that we know his gambit. I also have my reservations about the once and again widowed, Pelena. If anyone else was aware of his ruse, it would be her, so why hasn't she said anything?
{{200879108-0-79981:}}I was out exploring. Dawnwood may be a blessing, but I'm curious as to its origin. And the devastated area troubles me.\n\nI ran into Wood Elves with a covered cart. There was a whiff of strange magic about it. It must have been one of these seeds!
{{200879108-0-79982:}}Strange. She was most definitely here. She even offered to finish brewing it. I've been so busy as of late that I accepted her offer. It's not everyday Pelena lends a hand around the estate. Wait, could Pelena have poisoned Lady Weatherleah?
{{200879108-0-79983:}}We Wood Elves are children of the Green. Long ago, we swore to never harm the living forest. We do not cut wood or pluck fruit. In exchange, the forest shelters us and shapes itself to our needs.\n\nThose who follow the Dawnway walk a different path.
{{200879108-0-79986:}}Just as you did here, use the fable to find your way. Dispel the wards and, with key in hand, you should be able to open the door. \n\nAnd meet the Luminary Indrik face to face.
{{200879108-0-79987:}}He will likely ask you to prove yourself worthy of his power. I have a good feeling about you, interloper. Altar-breaker. I have faith you can do it. \n\nMagnus guide you on your journey, and I'll see you back at the Scholarium.
{{200879108-0-78584:}}I'm not sure, and even if I did, I wouldn't tell Grander's hired aide. Just know it will be far away from here. Beyond the Highlands and the overgrowth. Beyond even the reach of my family's wealth.
{{200879108-0-81426:}}Ledgers, journals, letters, alchemical notebooks—anything that gives us some idea of Lord Gallio Valente's plans for the wine.\n\nVampires can't drink it, but they're the ones invited to bid on it. We need to know why.
{{200879108-0-81003:}}Control? No. But I have the power to see them, to follow their threads and alter their fates. It is one of the things that Hermaeus Mora respects about me. And the one thing he fears the most.
{{200879108-0-80826:}}With my whole heart. I saw more than enough during my time with the Dominion military to know we need a better tomorrow. A glimmering dawn on the horizon.
{{200879108-0-79203:}}A phrase emerges from the storm. Sage's Dream. Yes, that's it. A drink, I think. It tastes of belonging. Cohesion.\n\nThe innkeeper. Ask him to make this drink for me. Quickly, before the storm takes me again.
{{200879108-0-79200:}}Dawnwood, or whatever they're calling the new forest. A nasty tangle of woods and wilderness just like Valenwood. It doesn't belong on this side of the Strid. In fact, it's only good for the lumberyards!
{{200879108-0-79205:}}It dates back to the First Era, at least. The time when Rislav the Righteous defeated an Alessian army. I enjoy the study of history, when I'm not doing backbreaking labor for today's Colovians.
{{200879108-0-79204:}}This city is ancient, and the Colovians are proud of that. They act as though they personally had something to do with its longevity. It's ridiculous.
{{200879108-0-81368:}}I … I sent Torvesard and the other scions away. They had to remain hidden, free to act when the time was right ….\n\nThe rest … is still unclear. We learned much on that path about the Lamp of Clarity and Sage's Dream.
{{200879108-0-79778:}}Vashabar is done with kings, but I can speak for the people of Dawnwood. It falls to me to make good on the obligation Nantharion left us.\n\nWe must try to make amends for the damage he inflicted on West Weald.
{{200879108-0-81150:}}For now, I'll keep Skingrad safe from any conflict. These times are difficult, to say the least, but West Weald will persevere. With Burnbiscuit safe and sound, I feel anything is possible.
{{200879108-0-81151:}}Ah, yes. Legionary—ahem—Sergeant Luther will be fine. I need a bodyguard for Burnbiscuit and he'll fill that role nicely. He just needs some healing and rest.
{{200879108-0-81152:}}It's a taxing job. There are a lot of moving parts. You could say that being the Count of Skingrad is a lot like … owning a vineyard. It is like being a vintner.
{{200879108-0-81154:}}Why, isn't it obvious? The citizens of West Weald, of course! Keeping them satisfied, safe, and happy are my goals and my honor.
{{200879108-0-81155:}}A vintner must focus on everything. Workers, wine, customers, vermin, competitors, and many more things. The Legion are my workers, Skingrad is my wine, and the Recollection and Daedra are both vermin and competitors. Of a sort.
{{200879108-0-79395:}}No, no. I'm all right.\n\nI mean, I'm not, but it's better for both of us if you just moved on. I deserted my post in Cyrodiil. I'm on the run. You could get in trouble for speaking to me.
{{200879108-0-79394:}}Count Calantius governs West Weald from the city of Skingrad. He's a shrewd leader. When dignitaries visit Skingrad, the count offers them use of the Rustwall manor house.\n\nIt's the count's way of … how did he put it? Encouraging positive outcomes.
{{200879108-0-79396:}}That's why I'm out here. I've got nowhere to go. The Legion watches the city for deserters. And they consider anyone who fights on the side of one of the alliances to be a traitor and a criminal. I dare not even go back to my family.
{{200879108-0-79391:}}A number of them went into the ruin to the east. I think they're still inside. I would go in after them, but there are too many for me. And my heart is heavy with grief over the loss of my companions.
{{200879108-0-79390:}}The Recollection happened. I was out scouting when they attacked our camp. Most of them were gone by the time I returned, which is the only reason I didn't die with my companions.\n\nWe came here to hunt our enemies, but we became the hunted instead.
{{200879108-0-79393:}}Nantharion is no king of mine! Not anymore. Using corrupted magic like the wildburn? It's a betrayal of the Green. My companions felt that way, too.\n\nI didn't see him here, stranger. But he could be inside the ruins.
{{200879108-0-79392:}}Greenspeaker Darolith told everyone in Vashabar about the false king and his wildburn seeds. She said we needed to find the Recollection and stop them from planting more seeds. We were but one group sent out.\n\nBut the Recollection found us first.
{{200879108-0-79398:}}I'm not sure. I need to leave these lands. Maybe board a ship in Anvil and go somewhere where I won't be recognized. But we shouldn't discuss this.\n\nThe less you know about my plans, the better off you'll be.
{{200879108-0-81989:}}Oh, that's easy. I just sniff my way around. Ulfsild always said I had a nose that could find a sweetroll in the Deadlands. I just close my eyes and trust my snout.\n\nThat's how I got into the library, and the Gryphon's domain.
{{200879108-0-81988:}}That's a funny story! The Gryphon is a great hero, and he was trying to protect some people in a little village. There was a war on, Elves coming from the west.\n\nI was there because the local baker made this incredible honey bread and barrow-cheese.
{{200879108-0-81986:}}You want to ask me questions about me? I mean, I'm just a little guy.\n\nWhat do you want to know, what can I tell you?
{{200879108-0-81984:}}Ulfsild's mate was an old fool. And the Daedric Prince of nonsense … bah. \n\nYou have a Luminary's apology, mortal. This has not been an easy awakening. Once, my feathers were armor. My talons cut stone and my beak could rend the sky itself.
{{200879108-0-81284:}}By reputation. We only just met. I know she does troubleshooting for Count Calantius, so I figured I might run into her eventually. She apparently heard about me, too, and just showed up on my doorstep.\n\nYou learn anything else out there?
{{200879108-0-80638:}}I don't have a problem with Wood Elves. I have a problem with squatters and conquerors! I can be hardheaded, but Beragon's proven himself to be a loyal ally. And the people of Vashabar were tricked by Nantharion.\n\nI can admit I was wrong about them.
{{200879108-0-80637:}}Both tribes have shamans again, and they're letting me enter their camps to observe their crafting habits. I may have enough evidence to support my theories now. After this, I think I might branch into other groups—Reiklings, maybe? Who knows?
{{200879108-0-80634:}}The Lamp only revealed hidden objects close by. And I think you need a clear idea of where you want to go to open a portal with Abolisher.\n\nDon't worry, friend. I suspect we'll need all three relics before we're done with this business.
{{200879108-0-80632:}}Well, business is still a little rocky, but my new drinks are starting to get noticed.\n\nI'm even working on one to commemorate this moment. Named for you, of course. The Helping Hand? The Mysterious Wanderer? If you have a suggestion, let me know!
{{200879108-0-80633:}}I haven't settled one way or another. But there's still a lot I need to do, so I'll remain constable for a little while longer.\n\nWhatever I decide, Ontus will be better off without the baron and Lady Raxalee putting elixirs in the food supply.
{{200879108-0-80631:}}Well, to be honest, we're still working through what Nantharion's betrayal means to the village. How to reconcile followers of the Dawnway with our Green Pact faithful. \n\nMay the Singer listen, I hope Clen and I can help with that.
{{200879108-0-81194:}}There are a couple of wards along the way. You reveal and break them, and I can dig, dig, dig to reveal the path. Easy!\n\nRemember, we have to move quick. And uh … don't look down.
{{200879108-0-81217:}}The fool thought he could show up and demand half the fortune for himself. And the more you and that investigator dug, the more reckless he became. When he threatened to out me and take the entirety of the fortune, I knew I had to kill him.
{{200879108-0-81215:}}No matter how clever or compassionate we are, we must fight for what we believe in. \n\nGather your feathers, use what you've learned on your journey, and defeat the beast of the maze. Good luck.
{{200879108-0-81214:}}The fortune was always my goal. I was happy playing the doting wife, but when Uriel went off to battle I got greedy. Some old and unsavory acquaintances put me in touch with an assassin. Theophan.\n\nI thought I had it all figured out.
{{200879108-0-81211:}}I don't know if we can spare the time. Each moment we delay is another chance for Marcan Caelum to escape. I'll call for the others when we find a way down to the cellars. Then we'll all press on together.
{{200879108-0-81218:}}That wretched old woman had one last twist of the knife up her sleeve. I hope she's enjoying this from whatever corner of Oblivion she's in. Damned woman never did like me. She was right, but still.
{{200879108-0-78643:}}It is. The vineyards latest vintage, Vesper Valente. Lord Valente did tell us that his guests probably wouldn't want to try it before the auction, but that I should freely provide it to their attendants and servants.
{{200879108-0-81196:}}We heard screaming. It sounded a lot like him, but it stopped. That never means anything good.
{{200879108-0-80103:}}For the duration. You have more Luminaries to find, this complex needs to be explored. And the secrets of Scribing are just waiting to be teased from the past. \n\nWhat about you, friend? This expedition would be nothing without you.
{{200879108-0-78894:}}I'll find my way to the Far Shores before I let that happen. Promise me you'll send me on my way if he turns me again.\n\nNow it's time to draw my blade and make good on my promise.
{{200879108-0-82205:}}Much warmer in Colovia, wasn't it? I have fond memories of our time there. Despite the, um, bloody events.\n\nI've continued with arcane research since then. Sadly, my planned treatise on mind control potables is on hold while I help in this crisis.
{{200879108-0-79764:}}What does that even mean? Oh! Are you trying to trick me with more of your nonsense mortal words?\n\nI was just probably trying to remember all the work that's piled up while I've been helping you. The Great Eye can be a very demanding master.
{{200879108-0-79015:}}I cannot say. Daedric Princes are supreme within their own realms. The longer we are delayed, the stronger Ithelia grows. In fact, the next defense we trigger may be more dangerous—I do not think it would be wise to use Abolisher here.
{{200879108-0-80900:}}Despair, sadness, depression. What does it matter? I don't have the strength to argue with you.\n\nI hoped the river would calm me, but the flowing water just reminds me how stuck I am in this miserable life. Please, let me rot. It's all I'm good for.
{{200879108-0-80901:}}I got excited! That happens sometimes. And it's what I'm good at. Stealing, I mean. \n\nLet's start over. I'm the Fox! Ulfsild said one day people might try to break in. When I saw you sniffing around, I thought I'd try and protect my friend.
{{200879108-0-80902:}}About that. I took quite the mouthful of pages? And then I dropped one when your friend, Nahlia was it? When she saw me. \n\nSo uh … I thought it best to hide the other pages near the other wards. Good news though, I hid one right here!
{{200879108-0-80903:}}That's why I stopped hiding. When I got close I could smell the Indrik on you. If the Indrik thinks you're good, then you're good. That guy knows good.\n\nI see now I was just holding you back. Let me make it up to you.
{{200879108-0-80906:}}That's too kind, really. Don't waste your time on me, I'm sure you have better things to do.\n\nBut if you insist, I suppose I'll still be here. The river is rising much more slowly than I thought it would.
{{200879108-0-79761:}}That two healthy people not connected to the ranch or quarry were suddenly inflicted with fatigue fever and died faster than any other victims.\n\nMy father planned to talk to Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee next. Do that while I investigate the healer.
{{200879108-0-79763:}}I am not sure what you mean. I remember our adventures quite clearly. We saved Nirn and Apocrypha from rogue Dremora and a revived Ayleid cult. \n\nAnd do not fear. I shall never forget that we accomplished all that primarily due to your actions.
{{200879108-0-80016:}}I don't know. The fate of Ulfsild and Shalidor spiraled out of my sight when I was left to watch the Scholarium.\n\nThey were very much in love, unless something changed between them. But they understood they would not see the end together.
{{200879108-0-78981:}}Yes. Beragon and Tribune Alea ceased to be real to us and became real somewhere else. That is the nature of the Many Paths and a terrifying example of how the ability to navigate them can be misused.
{{200879108-0-79585:}}The outcast in … what? I don't understand! Oh! You mean the Outcast Inn.\n\nI heard of it. Friend said it attracts weird folks. Hopefully a drunk Orc will be the least of their worries.
{{200879108-0-81825:}}I have little experience with either, so any speculation is merely a guess. If Ostumir was truly the epicenter of the new forest growth, the land there could simply be unstable. Or perhaps Y'ffre shook the ground to warn us and get our attention.
{{200879108-0-81826:}}This portal is old magic, keyed to require two people to enter at the same time. I think. That's where you come in. I'll see if I can stabilize it. Then we go through together. \n\nDo you have any questions before we head in?
{{200879108-0-81827:}}Yes, but we only arrived here to begin our training a few days ago. Before that, I worked at the ranch in Ontus. An older friend who I admired, Marius Gallo, was the hero of the town. Everyone was so proud when he joined the Legion.
{{200879108-0-81821:}}The Netch acted like it was another trick, but I've felt for some time like my magic has stagnated. That was … it was really hard. But it was kind of a joy to really challenge myself.\n\nStill think I'll stick to swords and shields, though. Hah!
{{200879108-0-81439:}}Just that she wanted to look into something you and she found on your travels together. She left instructions assigning me to aide-de-camp duty for you and the Wood Elf.\n\nThat's a fancy term for a legionary who doesn't get to fight.
{{200879108-0-81430:}}Firandil has a way of getting his hands on things you wouldn't expect, like he's got a sixth sense about ancient relics and magic.\n\nHe's … basically he's a treasure-hunter and merchant. But he's extremely reliable.
{{200879108-0-81435:}}Mirrormoor. What a desolate place. If that's where these Shardborn come from, we need to learn more.\n\nAnd the blade we took. Vargas called it Abolisher. I know someone trustworthy who might be able to identify it. Would that be all right with you?
{{200879108-0-81637:}}A bit of a loaded question, no? For me, it's about living my story as best I can. And helping those around me to do the same.\n\nY'ffre is, at his heart, a storyteller. And every story deserves to be told, no matter how large or small.
{{200879108-0-81633:}}I used to get into trouble just for fun. Adventuring, treasure-hunting—that sort of thing. So rushing into danger to help the Ostumir survivors is no big deal. It's the right thing to do.\n\nOtherwise, I'm mostly settled down these days. Mostly.
{{200879108-0-78822:}}Well, in addition to the memory you saw of Ithelia heading toward the inn, Leramil says there are tangled threads of fate converging in that area.\n\nWhatever's going on there, you need to help Leramil figure it out.
{{200879108-0-78828:}}Grivier's been working with these bastards! He must know where Balandrus is hiding. And he can tell me what happened to Tham.\n\nAfter that, I'll show him the same mercy he gave the townsfolk.
{{200879108-0-78829:}}You … you know about that? I had no choice! It was turn on the townsfolk or lose my family!\n\nBut you're helping Maerenah. She's one of them! She'll turn on you the moment you're no longer useful. Just like Balandrus did to me!
{{200879108-0-78566:}}Excellent. The seal is still intact. We should return to the manor now that we've secured the will. I am certain our roosting vultures are keen to hear what it has to say. Meet Mizzik by the manor house when you are ready to meet the others.
{{200879108-0-80319:}}If the Daedra can't get close to the barricade, they can't knock it down. So we'll set it on fire.\n\nMy legionaries already brought up oil. I need you to pour it over the barricade. Soak it well. Then come back here.
{{200879108-0-80318:}}I think it's about the Dragon, but I could be wrong. I love puzzles, but Ulfsild's echo said some pretty cryptic stuff.\n\nIt's in the first room straight ahead as soon as you enter the east wing. Just let me know if I can be any help.
{{200879108-0-80742:}}Oh, the Imperial City. I'm sure I don't need to tell you how dangerous it is there right now.\n\nDaedra aren't the only roaming enemy that'll run you through first chance they get. Blessings to you if you choose that one, but stay safe.
{{200879108-0-79900:}}I will return to my order in Skingrad and tell my fellow priests that Nonungalo has been exorcised. The Legion should also know about the Daedra we encountered. I am sure they will want to investigate further.
{{200879108-0-79018:}}I did say we parted ways. Surely you, as an aspiring explorer yourself, should have caught the nuance. I'm of no obligation to be forthright with the specifics of how all parties came to be here at Wendir.
{{200879108-0-79019:}}They were the devoted servants of King Dynar, gathered from the four corners of Mundus to guard the Emblem of their king. Lor-Emero, Parhaelia, Ballepelin, and Yondvarla. Each a legend among the Ayleids in their own right.
{{200879108-0-79016:}}I have witnessed enough of Ithelia's realm to feel the power flowing through it. I believe I can use my portal magic to proceed deeper into the Loom. Perhaps even reach its core.\n\nAs long as Ithelia does not sense our approach, we should be fine.
{{200879108-0-79017:}}I should never have mentioned the Emblem of the Last King to the Recollection. They sent a large contingent of helpers and drove me off. \n\nThe Emblem was part of the regalia of the Last Ayleid King, Laloriaran Dynar. You know about King Dynar?
{{200879108-0-79010:}}I see you remember our adventures in the shrines of the Good Daedra. I believe we may find important memories for the Echonir to reveal here, as well.\n\nWatch for places where it can show us something, proxy.
{{200879108-0-79011:}}Indeed. And whatever caused that also completely drained the Skein's power.\n\nPerhaps Ithelia protected the Loom of the Untraveled Road against the influences of her rival Princes. Or is this some property of the Loom itself?
{{200879108-0-78820:}}It was a long time ago, friend. Close to forty years now. I was part of an adventuring company that explored Niryastare's great hall and the nearby chambers. We didn't get very far, though.
{{200879108-0-78823:}}Feldagard Keep is one of the largest fortresses in the Colovian Highlands. It's absolutely vital to the defense of West Weald. Tribune Alea went there after you found that report at Hoperoot.\n\nShe's concerned the Recollection plans an attack, friend.

{{21337012-0-8201:}}Translated by Varederil, Psijic Order\n\nWe know very little of the Sinestral language, which complicates efforts of translation into the common word. I've used Yoku as a starting foundation, but the two languages diverge considerably despite the geographical proximity of the relevant people. Nonetheless, I believe the following story hews as close to the original as it's possible to achieve today.\n\nAs you read, note the interesting switch between verse and prose. It's unclear whether this was an artistic flourish, or if it represents a cultural detail. Also, I won't claim to be a skilled poet; I stuck to translation instead of creative interpretation.\n\n* * *\nLong after the battle fell silent,\nI sat, still, on ichor-slicked stone,\nregarding the fallen across the field.\nA cloud of moans drifted to me,\nrich with confusing despair.\nI sought our battle-sage,\nand gestured to the crying mass.\n"Why do they cry out, wise one?\nWe do not care for their wails,\nand no one else listens."\n\n"Our enemy believes a falsehood while they live, bladed one. Like us, the Yokudan knows life is brief and nothing awaits them in the final after. Rather than accept this, they tell stories that hide and obscure. Stories of an immortality that awaits after a mortal death. Their society clings to these beliefs, and through repetition hopes to make them real.\n\n"As their life draws to a close, the Yokudan's grip on these stories slips. The dying see clearly what we Kanuryai know—nothing awaits past the final after. Pity them, for the sudden confrontation with the Real brings them terror. Thus, the cries."\n\nNo moons rose on the wagon ride home.\nIn the thick black, I thought on these words.\nWhat cowards do we fight? What weakness?\nBile rose into my throat\nto imagine a people convinced\nthe Real has no hold on us all.\nOnce more I sought my teacher,\nhis placid face ready for questions.\n"Our enemy hears their wailing kin.\nHow can they still believe in stories?"\n\n"Do you know the Yokudan idea—Honor? A force existing outside the self. Our enemy thinks it grows by their actions and persists beyond death. To them, if one accumulates enough Honor then death becomes temporary.

{{21337012-0-8208:}}Here now, adventurer. Votary Nahlia has asked me to try to describe just exactly what the "power" granted to you by the Luminaries entails. I am new to the Scholarium, but rest assured I will bring the whole of my magical insights to bear on this subject.\n\nThe great power of the Indrik, it seems, have set up harmonic reverberations across Tamriel. Long dormant ley lines, much like the ones in the Sholarium itself, are waking. Further research is required. But the immediate effect, I believe, will allow you to see Scripts and Luminous Ink for what they are. Portends of future power, rather than merely scraps of paper or dull and lifeless writing materials. Certainly, as well, the little fawn led me to a cache of Scripts here in the Scholarium. Most exciting! I'll continue to search for more as you engage with the Luminaries further. \n\nAnd, of course, I will attempt to keep you updated on what discoveries I make. Good luck!

I am always eager to engage in some friendly badinage!\n\nYou can rely on me for any grimoire you might need, no matter the day. My scripts will rotate as adepts of the guild plunder my stores. And as you engage with the Luminaries I hope their power will allow for new opportunities. Be sure to visit me as you complete each of their trials.\n\nAnd of course let's not forget fair Caal.

{{21337012-0-7861:}}By Narsis Dren\n\nThe Ayleid Empire collapsed in the face of the Allesian Slave Revolt, its Sorcerer-Kings crushed by the rising power of the Nedic rebels. Not all the ancient Ayleid rulers were overthrown, however, and some city-states threw in with the former slaves, either out of self-preservation or because they felt the Nedic cause was just. \n\nNenalata was one of these states, under the rulership of King Laloriaran Dynar. As a result, his kingdom survived the fall of the White-Gold Tower and continued as a vassal state to the new Allesian rulership. Over time, these vassal states were absorbed into the Allesian Empire. Ultimately, Emperor Amiel <Note in the margin: "Or is it Ami-El?"> issued an ultimatum to expulse the surviving Ayleids and take over their kingdoms. King Dynar fled before the Alleisan armies, and in the confusions the symbols of his office—Crown, Scepter, and Emblem—were lost. <Note in the margin: "Check with Elfbetta about the year. Original sources are unclear.>\n\nDynar had five loyal retainers in his service. He entrusted the Emblem to them, thereafter known as the Emblem of the Last King. The loyal retainers we know were:\n\nLor-Emero, a noble knight in the service of the king.\nParhaelia, also known as the Terrible Fist.\nBallepelin the Boisterous, a noted adventurer of great humor and girth.\nYondvarla, also known as the Oracle. \n\nThese four were all Ayleids. The last retainer, whose name has been lost to history <Note in the margin:  "The One Unnamed?"> was apparently Nedic, though his origin, along with his name, remain unknown. To those Five Loyal Retainers Dynar entrusted his Emblem, and they retreated to a haven that I believe is now called the ruins of Wendir. The ruins were also rumored to hold one of the Ten Ancestors—ancient statues from the Fall of the Empire, but I have yet to confirm this. This may be why this location was chosen.\n\nThe legends I (well, Elfbetta) tracked down indicated that the One Unnamed was the last to arrive, and this Nedic retainer sealed the doors to the underground crypts beneath Wendir, though whether physically or by magic is unclear. The One Unnamed may have been a great spellcaster, for the legends say that the Five Loyals protect the Emblem to the present day.\n\n<Final note in the margin: "Bring more assistants!">

We've been at this for three weeks now and have precious little to show except for ancient trash, sore muscles, and short tempers. And headaches for those of us forced to listen to that Dark Elf prattle on about his achievements.\n\nAll the promises of some great lost treasure have come to nothing so far, as all we found of interest has been ancient bottles of wine, water, and blood. The others are about to throw down their tools and quit this place. We're in the heart of Imperial territory, and I don't think they're going to take our explorations well once they find out we're here. But the Dark Elf keeps saying "one more room," "one more chamber," and "just look at this inscription." Bah!\n\nAnd then there are the traps, still active after all these centuries. The worst of them turn the careless to stone! We've found a few blocked passages and sealed entrances. We think there's one set behind a huge altar, but that has so far confounded us. Our Dark Elf may be able to get us through, but I'll be damned if we're going to ask him. Better to keep him away, or better yet, let a statue come to life and "accidentally" fall on him.\n\n I am sick to my back teeth of this place, these creatures, and most of all the "noted author and adventurer" Narsis Dren. May the Wild Hunt chase him and catch up with him!\n\nLove to the children, and tell them that mother will be back in a few weeks, But remember, not a word about the Recollection to anyone in Vashabar.

{{21337012-0-8197:}}Here written is the log of Captain Turseth Garil aboard the Indoril merchant vessel, the Intrepid Guar.\n\n19th day of Rain's Hand, 2E 572\nPleasant gales and smooth waters as we leave Necrom. Our destination is Lilmoth in Murkmire, with a healthy cargo of weapons and armor for our new Argonian allies. We hope to make port by Second Seed.\n\n20th Day of Rain's Hand, 2E 572\nOur fair weather continues to hold steady. The crew caught sight of a few Argonian fishing boats off the coast of Deshaan. Friendly smiles abound. Well, I believe they were smiling.\n\n21st Day of Rain's Hand, 2E 572\nStrange fog coming off of Black Marsh. Tinged green with an odious stench. We've decided to steer the ship further out to sea in hopes of finding the fog's edge.\n\n22nd Day of Rain's Hand, 2E 572\nThe fog persists and we have yet to find its edge. For fear of being swept out to deeper waters, I've instructed the crew to return to our southwestern heading in hopes of spotting the coastline.\n\n23rd Day of Rain's Hand, 2E 572\nThe fog persists. I've instructed the crew to release two tenders, tied to the ship, but given enough slack to venture twelve yards to the east and west. My hope is that we can avoid damaging our hull should we suddenly come upon a reef or rocky coastline. The crew will take four-hour shifts aboard the tenders.\n\n24th Day of Rain's Hand\nThe fog persists and I've lost all sense of where we are and, without a clear view of the stars, I can't get a proper heading. \n\n25th Day of Rain's Hand\nWe lost a crew member. He was aboard the western tender. A young boy, Uvren Faram. I knew his father. Some of the crew say they heard him screaming. No one wants to continue shifts aboard the tenders, but without scouts we run the risk of marooning ourselves on a reef or sandbar. I will volunteer myself for tender duty. I hope this will inspire confidence in the rest of the crew.\n\n26th Day of Rain's Hand\nDuring my shift aboard the western tender, I thought I caught a glimpse of the stars through the fog. It was just a moment, brief enough that I can't rule out a hallucination. What I saw! I did not recognize those stars.\n\n27th Day of Rain's Hand\nThe ship has been caught in some sort of current. The force of it was monstrous, as if the ship was suddenly yanked across the sea. Thankfully we were able to bring the tender scouts back in before the current tore the tenders loose. We have no clear understanding of where this current is taking us. I pray its out into clear waters and not the razor edge of a cliffside. Regardless, we're securing the crew in the galley and bracing the ship for impact should the worst come to pass.\n\n28th Day\nThe current is pulling us in circles. It was gradual at first, but as the hours pass it becomes clearer and clearer that we've been caught in some sort of tidal whirlpool. But, if that's the case, it isn't like any I've seen before. The scale of this must be, has to be, massive. Impossibly massive.\n\nUpdate\nThe boat is creaking. The whirlpool is straining every strut and rivet and a storm seems to have found our little ship. We're all scared. I just want the spinning to stop. Please, make it stop.\n\n1st Day Marooned\nI'll do my best to recount events. As we took shelter in the galley, there was a great cracking sound, like thunder. My second believes it was the mast snapping in two. After that it was a cacophony of sea spray, fracturing wood, and screaming. I must have blacked out. We awoke on a shore surrounded by debris from the ship. Of the twenty crew members I commanded, seven have been found. I assume the worst for the others, but we have yet to find their bodies.\n\nWe've yet to determine where we are. The vegetation is thick and dense, a jungle unlike any I've seen. I'm wary of leaving the shore, but if we don't find more supplies soon, we'll have to venture into the jungle for food.\n\n5th Day Marooned\nThe insects here are massive. Dartwings the size of adult scribs. And the beasts? Impossibly large, scaled monstrosities. Lizards the size of hillsides. So far, they don't seem bothered by our presence, and I'd like to keep it that way.\n\n7th Day Marooned\nWe've nearly exhausted our supplies and there's still no sign of edible vegetation. There's talk of hunting some of the smaller lizard beasts, but I worry about angering the herd.\n\n12th Day Marooned\nWe found Venasa Oril screaming beneath the shade of a strange tree. It seems she tried to drink its sap. There's talk of—but no. We'll bury her. Near the shoreline.\n\n* * *\nDoes it even matter?\n\nWe've walked along the shore for weeks in hopes of finding some sort of settlement or more debris from our wreck. The large insects have made for a decent supply of food, but I can feel myself withering away with every passing day.\n\n* * *\nThey're all gone. And I'm struggling to remember their names. I have to keep going. For them.\n\n* * *\nThere is no horizon. Only stone. Star of Azura, am I underground? Have we been underground this whole time?

{{21337012-0-8195:}}I've never had a mind for riddles. But there's something about them, isn't there? Something that pricks the ears, even to those like me. An irresistible allure to find that hidden meaning.\n\nThat's what I grappled with after hearing the fable of Mizbi. It was told to me by a moon-singer among a band of nomads we met when traveling through the jungles of Malabal Tor. Just listening, I knew there was a layer deeper than the riddles in the story. I could almost see it! If only I had it committed to page somehow. I'd pore over the words until the solution took shape before me.\n\nWhen we stopped that night, it was hot and humid, even for those unaccustomed to the climate. A Nord like me would have lost sleep even had I not been thinking of Mizbi and her Dragon. Their riddles. I left Shal's snores to our tent and wandered, hoping to find the nomad who told the story. Perhaps I could catch her early, and she'd tell it to me again.\n\nBut the only one I found awake in those small hours was gazing up at the stars—a springy little Cathay Khajiit, so young his stripes had only just started to come in. I settled across from him at the fire-pit, which must have died hours ago. "Shouldn't you be asleep, young one?"\n\nHe kept his eyes lofty and told me he liked to watch the stars move across the sky. I asked him if he had a favorite star or sign, and he grew shy, hiding his face. "I wonder if she sees me!"\n\n"Who?" I looked up, as if I might catch whoever he was talking about staring down at us.\n\n"She's not there now," he said. "Under the thunder of galloping hooves, she raises her gaze twice nightly to wink at me."\n\nA riddle? How fitting. And a child's riddle, so I actually stood a chance of solving it. Galloping hooves—the Steed. Twice nightly? "The Twilight Star? Azura?"\n\n"Azurah," he repeated. He put a hand on his chest and sighed a dreamy sigh. Only then did he really seem to notice me. He sat up. "You're that witch!" he said with reverence. The other nomads must have spoken of our passing through. "Can we trade?" He skittered over and pressed something heavy into my palm. It was a lustrous piece of well-polished moonstone the size of a winter plum.\n\n"Trade for what?" \n\n"That feather!" he said, pointing at my hat. \n\nOh. That feather. I was quite reluctant to part with it, and said as much, to his dismay.\n\nHe closed my hand over the moonstone again. "But the trade," he said, like we'd already agreed to it.\n\n"The feather is very dear to me. I've had it since I was as small as you!"\n\nAnd perhaps it was the curious look in those big, blue eyes, but I found myself telling him the fable of the Indrik. Which bled into my story of finding the Indrik, both when I was a child, and then when I was grown. And when I tried to press the moonstone back into his hand, he refused to take it.\n\n"A fair trade for your stories," he said, like I'd won some sort of game we'd been playing.\n\nI looked down at the moonstone. "I can trade this for a story?"\n\n"A story. A song. A feather. Anything within reason," he said. Maybe it was a child's understanding of trading and commerce, but if he found it fair, then so did I.\n\n"Do you know the tale of Mizbi and her Dragon?" \n\n"That old story? Who doesn't?"\n\nI didn't. Not by heart, like he and the other nomads must. Not yet, anyway. I caught his wrist and pressed the moonstone into his fuzzy little palm. "Then tell it to me," I said, reaching for a quill, ink, and parchment. "And tell it slow. It's my turn to find that Dragon.
{{21337012-0-8192:}}Day 9\n\nI couldn't have picked a more curious time to explore this part of the jungle. I'd been hoping to document some interesting fauna or wildlife, but I never thought I'd see something like this. It all happened so fast. My skin started to tingle and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, then out of nowhere, there was a huge explosion in the sky, and a great portal appeared high in the air. I thought I was imagining it at first. I am eager to learn what's going on, but the air here feels dangerous now. I need to keep out of sight.\n\nDay 10\n\nThe jungle is thick and dense, and makes it easier to observe without being seen. I've been lucky so far, though, because strange creatures continue to appear all around me in droves. Dremora, mostly, but also things I've never seen before. Horrible creatures made of glass. What are they up to? Why are they here? I still haven't figured that out yet.\n\nAs I've been slipping between trees and roots, I've seen strange golden spheres soaring through the sky- three of them, as far as I can tell, each shooting off into a different direction. They leave fluttering, magical streams through the air behind them. Strangely beautiful, really, and dreadfully enticing. I feel compelled to follow them. I hope to find answers at the end of their paths.\n\nDay 11\n\nI followed one of the golden spheres deeper into the jungle, and I know I must be close to the end of the trail. I hear cries of battle- maybe members of the legion?- and I can hear voices chanting in another language. I don't know what they're saying, but whatever it is can't be good. I'm going to hide here until the commotion dies down before getting any closer. Maybe, if the legion is here, they know more of what's going on.\n\nThe fighting waged on nearly all day, but it's finally over now. I waited a good little while before moving in closer, but I fear I delayed too long. There's nothing here now except the scars of battle strewn over the jungle floor. It was indeed the legion who were here. May their fallen rest easy.\n\nI was able to glean some information, though. The golden sphere that led me here has disappeared. And what's more, the sky portal has changed. It's hard to explain exactly, but there's more to it now. Like the magic around the portal has intensified.\n\nDay 12\n\nI think more of the legion must be in the area, and they must've followed another golden sphere. I can only see one flittering through the sky now, and just like what happened after the first sphere vanished, the sky portal grew in size after the second vanished, too. It's huge now, truly astounding to behold. Astounding and terrifying.\n\nDay 13\n\nSomething's happening. I don't know how much longer I'll be able to keep this up. The last golden sphere disappeared from the sky, and now the sky portal is growing, changing, coming alive. I don't know what's going on. I fear for my life. The ground all around me is shaking. Something fell out of the portal. Something big is here.\n\nI don't want to be here anymore. I need to get out of here. What was I thinking, sticking my nose where it doesn't belong? I'm go

{{21337012-0-8191:}}Recently, we heard increasingly urgent chatter of a sinister magic taking root all across the Weald. Folks said it was more of a feeling than anything else. Made their skin crawl or hearts drop into their bellies. But the stories all had one thing in common: The magic felt almost suffocating at four strange mosaics. One in the north, one in the west, and two in the south. That was enough to warrant an investigation.\n\nMy cohort was sent to the north. It was my first time up this way. The country up here is wide open and endless, but the closer we got to the mosaic, the more claustrophobic I felt. Just like the reports said.\n\nAt first, I wasn't sure we'd find anything. The mosaic certainly was unusual, and the air charged with something that just felt wrong, but we didn't know what we were looking for. Then the sky opened.\n\nThe air above us began to rip and tear itself apart, and before we could let out the breaths we'd been holding, writhing threads of energy shot out of a great rift and latched onto shards of glass that split open the earth. One of my friends in the troupe couldn't get out of the way before glass erupted right beneath her feet.\n\nAs we recovered from the shock of what just happened, we noticed little golden spheres wreathed in granules of glass drifting out into the wilds from the shards on the ground. The spheres left wispy trails of falling glass in their wake, like they were beckoning us to follow. After some talks, we decided to split our efforts and do just that to see where they'd lead.\n\nI and three of my cohort members followed one out across the rockiest part of the grasslands. Voices on the wind chased us, taunted us. Made things unpleasant. We eventually pursued the trail behind a great rock slab. None of us were prepared for what we'd find there.\n\nWe came across a giant Dremora shrouded in tendrils of golden energy, flanked by all manner of glass Daedra. As we drew closer, it became clear that his had been one of the voices we'd heard, and he was the one responsible for trails of glass- at least, the one that we had followed. It seemed like he was siphoning energy from the realm beyond the rift, with so much power that he carved it into the very air we breathed. Glass began to spread beneath his feet, creeping over the earth and laying waste to everything it touched.\n\nWhat happened next was all my fault. Fear took me and I dropped my shield, and the Deadra heard right away as it clattered to the ground. They swarmed us, and we fought in vain, having had no time to prepare. I watched in horror as one by one my comrades fell beside me. All alone, I ran. I hid. I feel so much shame.\n\nAnd so now I wait, either for the Daedra or others in my troupe to find me. Whatever happens first. I wish I had the strength to make it back to Skingrad, to tell everyone about what we found here, but I'm too weak, too injured. I can only wait and detail here what I've uncovered.\n\nThere are still so many unanswered questions. That giant Dremora was performing some kind of ritual, but for what purpose? And was he the only one? There were three glass trails, so my gut tells me there must be three of them out there somewhere.\n\nPlease, if I don't make it out of here, if anyone should find this, don't let our efforts go to waste.
{{21337012-0-8198:}}Strange how a memory can be linked so intrinsically to a smell. How a stray scent of jazbay can take me back to when I was little.\n\nWhen the winter months approached, and the air began to chill, my clan-mother would bake tarts from stunted wheat and berries deemed too bruised or over-ripe. A sweet treat, if chewy and dry, but the young ones, myself included, savored every bite. The tarts were a good sign. That we had plenty stored for winter and needn't be precious with scraps.\n\nOne winter, I was tasked with taking a basket of these treats to an elder. It was a hike uphill, and the air was sharp against my cheeks. The basket sat heavy in my arms as my breath billowed out in front of me. I must've stopped for a rest, with smoke from the elder's hut one last stretch away, when I heard a soft, weak little bark.\n\nAcross the road, peaking from beneath a shrub, was a little fox. It seemed so small to me. I thought it was a baby, lost out in the cold, hungry. I reached into the basket and offered it a tart, breaking it into pieces and tossing them its way.\n\nIt flinched, nearly ran, but I saw its little nose twitch, no doubt catching the tart's scent. It nervously ate the first and seemed, to my child eyes, that it savored it. It devoured the rest of the pieces in a flash. It was then that I noticed the scars. Thin lines around its ankles, small cuts along its coat. How many traps had it wriggled itself out of? How many of those traps had I laid myself?\n\nIt was then, while my mind wandered, that the fox leapt for my basket, deftly grabbing its handle tight with its teeth and bolting into the woods.\n\nI was stunned, convinced that I'd been tricked. This was no weak, sad creature, but a mischievous thief. I chased after it as quick as I could. Dodging branches and bushes and thick drifts of snow until I tumbled down a riverbank and landed facing a hollowed-out tree trunk.\n\nInside was my thief among a litter of pups and its thin mother who bared her teeth at me.\n\nI raised my palms to her and slowly lifted myself from the ground, careful to inch myself away from the trunk, from her babies. She relaxed, and so did I. I watched as she tended to her little ones, breaking the tarts down with her paws so they could eat small bites.\n\nI don't know how long I watched, but I remember how her ears perked when my clan-mother came barreling through the underbrush, red and scared. She thought I'd been taken by some beast, having never reached the elder's hut. She was angry when I shushed her. "You're going to scare the babies," I said, to which she bared her teeth and barked scolding remarks.\n\nHow strange it was to realize I had a fox mother of my own.\n\nIt's this memory that comes to me as I find myself on my hands and knees, following the scent of jazbay through the stacks of the Scholarium, praying that Shal doesn't walk in and see me. It was as I rounded a particularly dusty stack of books on Quadriva Arithmetia, that I saw the strangest thing. A fox, front paws perched up onto my desk, its nose nudging a small piece of faerite I used as a paperweight.\n\nAll at once I was a child again, slowly lifting myself up from the ground, hands in the air as to not startle it. It looked at me, cocked its head to the side, and smiled. Suddenly it took the faerite into its mouth and darted through the stacks.\n\nI wonder if it still would've ran had it known I was practiced at fox chasing. Had it known I could glide across the stone floors as if it were ice. That I knew every twisting corner and uneven cobblestone. Perhaps it was the smell of jazbay that gave the whole ordeal a sense of childlike bliss.\n\nI nearly had the fox, my fingers just barely grazing the tip of its tale, when it leapt at and through a wall. It was so sudden, so jarring, that I didn't have time to course correct. I braced myself, expecting fully that I would crash into the wall, when, miraculously, I went through it instead.\n\nI tumbled into a snow drift and sank deep enough that I had lost all sense of up and down. I squirmed, trying to right myself, when I felt something grip my leg and tug me loose. Free from the snow, I became aware of powerful wing beats and a flurry of ice and feathers. A gryphon.\n\nIt dropped me, rather unceremoniously, and stretched out its wings until they obscured the entirety of the sky. It was pounding its claws into the ground, readying to charge, when the fox appeared between its legs, nuzzling the gryphon for attention.\n\nThe little thief offered the gryphon my faerite, to which the gryphon relaxed and looked at me apologetically.\n\nI understood then what they were. A mischievous fox and their protective parent. I sat and watched as the fox kicked my faerite around and, I don't know when it happened, but I awoke wrapped in the gryphon's wings. Warm and safe.

The wind is pushing it our way. We've gathered what we need and prepare to move further down into the valley, towards the rivers. Toward the peltless ones.\n\n31st Day of Hare's Leap\nIt was a trap. Fire on one side, the blades of the peltless ones on the other. They called it vengeance. I call it slaughter. I escaped through the smoke.\n\n5th Day of Fawn's Cry\nMy wounds have healed, but I still feel the weight of their screams. The smoke has cleared, and the fires have been put out. I can't find the scent of any survivors. I am all that is left.\n\n8th Day of Fawn's Cry\nI understand now what I must become. The peltless ones see me as prey. My antlers a trophy. My pelt a prize. They will know what it means to be hunted.\n\n15th Day of Fawn's Cry\nTo the old ones, I pray. To the fallen, I cry. To my enemies, I curse.\n\nThey will know the taste of fear.

{{21337012-0-7870:}}A hunter traveled through green waters to the break of dawn, seeking a worthy quarry.\n|cb30000We're in Tamriel, for certain. Greenwater Cove? Dawnbreak? It must be Auridon. |r\n\nHe came across the Lady, stone-still with skirts pooled around her. \n|cb30000A mundus stone. I know the one—on an island in a small pond south and across the river from that little mining settlement. |r\n\nSomething huddled behind her—a creature of hooves and feathers and bones of the earth. It barked and gave chase when he got too close. He chased it through mud and brush and down into the earth, by amber light of culanda in gleaming halls of moon-gray stone.\n|cb30000The beast must be an Indrik. "Moon-gray" suggests the ruins of Ondil. |r\n\nThe long-legged creature shed its even longer shadow, leaving it to do battle with the hunter. The two met again among ruins of an isle brought low from the weight of a once-mighty tower. All that remained was a well of starlight at its center.\n|cb30000Buraniim, on the east coast. No tower, but there is an ancient well of power there. |r\n\nThe creature did not run, but considered the hunter as he approached.\n"Why did you chase me?" asked the creature.\n"I sought a worthy quarry," answered the hunter.\n"I was feeble and new to this world," said the creature. "Small and weak."\n"I would lose my sharpness in waiting for you to grow. And you had sense enough to run," said the hunter. "What use would that gift be if none ever chased you?"\n"Drink of this well with me," said the creature. "We were both made stronger by your pursuit."\n\nThe two foes bent their heads and drank of the well of starlight. Rejuvenated, they raised their heads as friends and ran again, dashing over the river, splashing through the Lady's skirts, stopping on a high overlook jutting out to the sea. \n\n|cb30000Consulted my map. This must not have been an island when the fable was written. Now, it's home to a lighthouse on the southwest coast of Auridon. I hope the door is still there.|r\n\nWhat a difference it made, thought the hunter as he stepped into the creature's glade, keeping stride with another rather than following in their wake.

{{21337012-0-8096:}}The Crow was fond of talking and traveling and shiny things. Only one in the woods answered her call and matched her wits. He was the Raven, handsome and solitary and wise from his many years.\n\nBefore too long, they were birds of a feather, building a grand nest together. All the magic of the forest was theirs.\n\nThe Crow collected shinies—gifts from her friends in the woods. At first, the Raven had many questions.\n\n"I can see the worth in these gifts of power. But what of these gifts of |c990000mystery|r?"\n\n"They reward my |c990000curiosity|r," answered the Crow.\n\n"And these gifts of |c990000loyalty|r?"\n\n"They were given to |c990000protect|r me. They strengthen our friendship," Crow explained.\n\n"It is an awful lot of unexpected |c990000charity|r," the Raven observed.\n\n"My friends are |c990000compassionate|r. It is good to share things. Like our nest! There is plenty of room for us and more."\n\nThough the Raven quickly lost interest in these curios, he saw they made the Crow happy, and made no complaint when she stashed these gifts beneath their grand nest.\n\nOne day, the Raven told the Crow he was thinking of bartering their nest. The Crow was distraught. What could her Raven have possibly considered trading their nest for? And to whom?\n\nHe told her a Stranger offered to trade it to him for a star. His eyes glittered with a longing she had never seen before. The Raven spoke of what wondrous things he could do with such a shiny gift. \n\nHad something changed in him? Or had he always been this way? The Crow couldn't say. Nor could she stop him. Once the Raven's bargain was in motion, there was no going back.\n\nThe Raven knew he had done wrong. He offered to help the Crow move what he could of her cache beneath the nest. But the Crow refused. If they were incomplete, if they were seen, if any of the gifts from her friends fell in the hands of the Stranger, it could spell disaster.\n\nSo the Crow chose to leave her treasures hidden and under secret guard. She plucked her own feathers, practically enough to make another crow. And without fully realizing how she'd done it, Feather-Crow was born in her image, a being not unlike her friends of the forest.\n\nCrow told the Feather-Crow to hide herself among the dark leaves and guard her gifts. Crow could not promise her return. She would leave this place. Her feathers would grow back. She would build a new nest. \n\nFrom that nest would come fledglings fed on the tales of Crow's grand treasure, the gifts given by her friends of the forest. Where others saw dark leaves, the fledglings would recognize their mother's feathers.\n\nBut Feather-Crow came from Crow. For all their talk of adding others to their nest, Feather-Crow knew it remained barren.\n\n"Then let the fledglings come from anywhere," the Crow decreed. "So long as they have the strength to |c990000make a vow|r to embody the virtues of my friends in the forest, their gifts and magic will be shared with them in return.
{{21337012-0-8130:}}A Homily by Father Haderus Donton\n\nTowering over the surrounding buildings in Skingrad is its Great Chapel, dedicated to Juilianos, divine of wisdom and logic. Yet Skingrad is known for its wine, abundance, and celebrations. How is it that a god of logic and reason, dour and cerebral pursuits, finds its greatest expression here?\n\nWell, Julianos is also known as a god of contradictions. But that is only part of the explanations. \n\nThe site of the Great Chapel was originally venerated ground, most likely dedicated to some Daedric Prince.  Exactly which Daedric Prince is unknown, as none of the surviving iconography seems to match any of the Princes. Yet with the banishment of the Ayleids and their Daedric-worshiping allies from these lands, the worship of Julianos took hold here. As Skingrad grew, its Grand Chapel and its school has brought all manner of scholars, pedants, and philosophers from across Tamriel, both seeking the truth and contributing their own truths to it.\n\nThe Great Chapel became a site of discussion, debate, and philosophical clashes among worshipers of the Divines as well as apostates. The faith of Julianos has welcomed a variety of viewpoints, even those that conflicted with their established dogma. In The Ten Commands of the Nine Divines, Julianos says "Know the Truth. Observe the law. When in doubt, seek wisdom from the wise." \n\nAnd wisdom its visitors seek, delving into questions great and small. What existed before creation? How did the world truly come to be? Is free will possible with all-seeing divines? Are the Daedric Princes truly free if they are bound to their inherent natures?  Debaters gather from far afield to consider these arguments on the chapel grounds and in surrounding taverns.\n\nThe chapel welcomes all such discussions, as long as they are civil. As a result, such sparring is more often done over a glass a wine as opposed to in battle. Crossing words as opposed to crossing swords. Often philosophers sponsor celebrations and feasts to help convince others of the validity and popularity of their points. As a result, Skingrad is a city of festivals, and at its center lies the Divine of Truth. It seems contrarian, but then, Julianos is said to be a god of contradictions, and can absorb many truths in the pursuit of the greatest truth.\n\nFor here is the heard of the matter: Truth must always be confronted. Must always be challenged.  It must always be tested. If apparent contradictions invalidate the truth, then it cannot be entire truth. If logic is the Shield of Julianos, then contrariness is its sword. A wall that is not pushed against serves no real purpose. Virtue that is not tempted has no weight. An idea that is unchallenged is mere dogma, and not beneficial to its priest or its believers. That ultimate truth lays at the center of Julianos's faith. \n\nSuch it has been, such it ever shall be.

These "scraps" are magically inclined in the same way as signature scripts, the Dragon's specialty.\n\nIt appears that treasure troves from numerous sources are now being "improved" by the addition of these parchment pieces. So far I've heard reports that they can be acquired from:\n\n- Ancient dungeons\n- Battlefields between adventurers\n- The front in Cyrodiil \n- The battle arenas in locales like the Maelstrom or Dragonstar Arena\n- Large scale adventurer trials like the assault on Cloudrest or the delve into the Halls of Fabrication\n- Even the caches rewarded from from master writs!\n\nA most puzzling conundrum, perfectly formed from that perfidious Dragon's pate!

{{21337012-0-8218:}}I opened a portal to Eyevea. Or at least, I thought I had. I emerged in complete darkness! But a mage is never without means of making light. I could feel masses of magicka like the sun somewhere far above me, so I began to climb through the caverns, which gave way to cleared ruins of a bygone age. At last, I found daylight. I had made it to Eyevea, only very far beneath it. \n\nI swam to the center island, where I saw signs of a settlement. I was a daughter of Skyrim, and the water felt warm as a bath to me. The trees were heavy with blossoms, even at this time of year. I wandered, calling for Shalidor. Inside, I found myself in his study. A veritable library of parchment organized by no method known to Nirn nor Oblivion. But among the scribblings, I spotted my name.\n\nNot just once, mind you. I read them, of course. I'm not ashamed to say. A year's worth of unsent letters and apologies. Confessions, false starts, academic musings. All addressed to me. I was in the middle of reading when I was startled by the appearance of a lovely High Elf woman, who seemed just as surprised to see me. To my relief, she introduced herself as an appointed caretaker, tending to the place while Shalidor was away.\n\nNaturally, I inquired where he was away to, as I was hoping to meet with him rather urgently. But such a meeting wouldn't be possible for some time, she said, as he was headed to Skyrim. By boat to High Rock, then on by foot from there. He meant to visit an old friend, she told me, but he hoped to see what other marvels he might find along the way. She told me how long ago he'd left and estimated that he'd probably reach his destination any day now.\n\nBy the time a portal opened heralding his return, I'd made myself quite at home on Eyevea. He appeared well-traveled, cloak stained from the road and his beard grown long and wild. In his hands were my scribbled notes on portal magic, and dozens of unsent letters bearing his name that he'd no doubt discovered upon reaching my cottage.\n\nIn the long time I've known him, a smile on his face is as rare as the sun in a Skyrim winter. But I'll never forget the one he had for me that day.\n\nThe caves beneath the island would someday become the Scholarium. Though our travels often led us apart from one another, we would always return to meet again on Eyevea.\n\nHe wished to offer me eternal life so that we might spend it together. I wished to spend my single mortal life as his partner. You might ask yourself, whose wish was the greater show of the love we'd come to share?\n\nIf we ever come to a consensus on that, I imagine we no longer walk this world together.

But out of nowhere, he just calmed down and looked all confused. Told us he was a "pyandonean pearl merchant" simply named Fah'ri. We tried to sell him more skooma and he told us he doesn't touch the stuff before running off. There's something wrong with this cat. More wrong than most skooma fiends, I mean. \n\nDay 15: Khajiit came back, calling himself Wei this time. He reeked of moon sugar and…cheese for some reason. He barely said anything to us, just walked into our camp and started cowering in our hunting cage, screaming! Said that we were gonna kill him and were keeping him captive. Strangely enough, the cage he walked into is wide open. On his way in, he dropped this strange necklace with this big purple gem in the middle. I might hold onto it, it looks valuable.

{{21337012-0-7863:}}To: Bregorin, Keeper of the Recollection\nFrom: Gwindethor, Expedition Liaison\n\nKeeper Bregorin,\n\nI beg to report that the work at Wendir proceeds slowly. The area surrounding the ruin is inhabited by minotaurs, who take a dim view of our presence here. They have gotten into the underground passages as well and this may indicate that there are other entrances than the one we know about.\n\nWe found nothing so far that indicates that the Emblem of the Last King or other Ayleid relics are within. Most discoveries have been abandoned bottles of aged wine, holy water, and blood. The complex is sprawling, and there are several places where our progress is halted by some blockage or sealed gate. Exploration is further hampered by statues that come to life and attack our explorers. Deadly traps are still active after all these centuries. In particular, many these traps emit a petrifying gas which immobilizes the target and gives them a calcified appearance, making it look like they have been turned to stone. \n\nFinally, there has been great difficulty with our "official expert." He may have some knowledge in his field but has proved to be insufferable in his dealings with others. If he is not boring our fellow Wood Elves with ridiculous tales of his exploits, he is drooling over some statue, inscription, or broken pottery shard that we have excavated. Frankly, I do not trust him to not pocket some valuable trinkets for his own use.\n\nI humbly request that we dismiss this expert immediately, either removing him from the excavations or removing him from the branches of Life. He is getting on my nerves, and if he reminds me one more time of how he impressed you with his suaveness and knowledge, I will throw him down a well myself. \n\nAlways remember,\nGwindethor
{{21337012-0-7862:}}By Narsis Dren\n\nThe research into the ruins of Wendir have proved to be extremely profitable, and I believe that the Emblem of the Last King will be found there. This is a chance for an ultimate discovery! A boon to research! A series of best-selling books for me!\n\nHowever, a difficulty in finding adequate assistance has arisen. Borfree Dull-Blade is usually a perfect blunt instrument for this sort of thing, but the Nord is off visiting his family, and old colleagues seem to be a bit <several scratched out words that might be "selfish" or "cowardly"> reticent to engage with this new opportunity. Elfbetta is loyal as always, but while she has a keen eye and excellent research skills, I hesitate to put her into dangerous situations. (Besides, she runs faster than I do.) I cannot expect to hang around dangerous ruins in the hopes of some <scratched out words "idiot" and "fool"?> capable volunteer will show up to aid me.\n\nFor this reason, I've reached out to a group of militant Wood Elves known as the Recollection. This new organization recently appeared in West Weald—not unlike the new forest that sprang out of nowhere along the southern border. I met with one of their mid-range officials as they are very reluctant to identify who is actually in charge. Perhaps they don't know, She and I spent a pleasant evening over ale and small plates as I regaled her with my knowledge of the Ayleids (Elfbetta's extensive research was somewhat helpful here) and my plans for an expedition into Wendir. She volunteered to bring a few trusted members of the Recollection to help with the digging, fighting, and heavy lifting.\n\nNow, I'm not sure I made the wisest decision. Oh, everything is proceeding smoothly and we should have the Emblem of the Last King in hand by the end of the week. I'm just starting to get the feeling these Wood Elves may not be willing to let me take the prize.
{{21337012-0-7860:}}Captain Leronus,\n\nDamned if your suspicions weren't true. I found a pile of bloodied armor buried in the forest. Your legionaries aren't deserting. Someone is killing them.\n\nThe staff knows to take refuge in the catacombs during an attack. They'll be safe until you give the all clear. I have the only key, so let me know when you're ready.\n\nStay safe captain.\n\nGroundskeeper Gaius

Search the nearby Ayleid ruins for a mature wildburn seed. Find and recover a seed as quickly as possible. It is imperative that we have such a seed for the next phase of our campaign, no matter the cost.\n\nEnter the ruins that extend below Ostumir. At the roots where Dawnwood originated should be a large seed. You'll know it when you see it. Recover the seed and bring it to me.\n\n<a message is scribbled below in different handwriting>\n\nBeragon and friend—\n\nHad to run for obvious reasons. Join me down in the ruins. I think you'll like what I have to show you.
{{21337012-0-7866:}}[First Entry]\nStrange. I am drawn to this place, yet I know not why. Every time I pass through Fargrave, my steps always lead me here. I feel like I should know these streets and walls, but why?\n\n[Second Entry]\nI learned the name of this place from an ancient scroll. This portal leads to the Loom of the Untraveled Road. If only I knew what that meant!\n\nThe portal is sealed by a strange warding. The mirrors are the key, of course. I have activated them in every conceivable combination, and yet the portal remains shut. I begin to believe that some change beyond my power must come to this realm before it will open.\n\n[Third Entry]\nIt has been centuries since last I visited here, and still I am no wiser. I am the shardmarshal, though I do not remember how I earned that rank. I command what remains of the Shardborn, though I can not recall where we come from or where we belong. A seed of disquiet gnaws at me. What is our purpose? We wander and wait, but wait for what? We are drawn to Fargrave, yet no one in this strangely familiar realm knows anything of our origin. What have we forgotten?\n\n[Fourth Entry]\nI spoke with Torvesard again. He too shares a sense that something is missing. A part of ourselves, taken away. He intends to seek through all the planes of Oblivion until he finds what what we lost, but that would be futile. When I stand before this Loom, I know that I am close to remembering the secret. It shall be revealed here, or nowhere at all.\n\n[Fifth Entry]\nAnother century, and yet nothing has changed. The passage of the years is nothing, of course. But I grow weary of the wait.

{{21337012-0-8140:}}[First Entry]\nI found Elenglynn right where the mapmaker in Skingrad said I would. A typical example of late-period Ayleid architecture. A brief search revealed a door leading to the vaults below. If there are any forgotten treasures to be recovered from this place, that's where they will be. I'll begin my explorations in the morning.\n\n[Second Entry]\nWell, Elenglynn lives up to its reputation for deadliness! The upper passage is a gauntlet of swinging-blade traps. Simple mechanical devices, easily avoided with careful timing.\n\nThe forest beasts are more of a problem. Elenglynn's upper levels are positively infested with wasps and hoarvors. They must have found their way down here through natural fissures or collapses.\n\n[Third Entry]\nI made it past the flooded upper hall and found myself in a series of chambers illuminated by Ayleid crystals. Naturally, I encountered more traps—dark welkynds, in this case. The black crystals lash out with blasts of energy if you venture too close. I also found minotaurs, but I expected that. I avoided the brutes with a little stealth.\n\n[Final Entry]\nI reached the maze of Elenglynn, but I suffered a setback. I was ready for the gas grates—I have seen them in other Ayleid ruins. Wasn't expecting undead guardians as well. Ancient skeletons, hidden by green mist pouring from the grates. Didn't see the one behind me. I managed to retreat, but not before he got me.\n\nToo tired and hurt to continue right now. Think I'll rest here for a bit, then make my way back to the surface.

The Orcs believe Malacath entrusted the Staff to their care ages ago, and they have been guarding it ever since.\n\nI asked Torvesard why the staff is important. He told me it is a Daedric weapon that was stolen from the realm of the Shardborn. Supposedly it draws upon the magicka of the Many Paths, allowing its bearer to wield the power of change itself.

{{21337012-0-8147:}}By Archivist Oriane Pamarc\n\nThe echoes of Nirn's history reverberate deeply, harking back to bygone knowledge and secret traditions that have long since passed out of living memory. But while the men and mer who first sounded that call are gone, their echoes may help us shape some sense of their culture and beliefs.\n\nOne such enigma is the religious beliefs and objects of worship of the ancient Atmorans. Some of this knowledge has been preserved through historic documentation of the Dragon Cult, but accounts have recently been unearthed that suggest the existence of more esoteric groups. \n\nThese records are fragmentary, to say the least, written in an archaic runic alphabet. A great deal of effort has been made to translate these slivers of writing into something comprehensible, but even with many brilliant minds on the issue, scholars cannot agree if the transcriptions are about literal creatures and practices, or instead represent religious allegories.\n\nThe following passages have been gathered here for ease of reference. My colleagues and I collectively refer to them as the Atmoran Cult Writings.\n\nTHE CULT OF MOTHER MOTH\nWrapped in soft night, she sings to us. One flap of her great wings dusts the landscape in silver-powdered sleep. She bids us live well by day, but savor the shadows. For what would light be if there were no darkness to compare it to?\n\nMother Moth sees all. Her many-faceted eyes hold all of Atmora within them, thus is she able to see the faithful and the unfaithful. Only we few know her secrets, have heard her song, and pay her homage.\n\nOur glorious, furred mother exudes patience, excellence, softness, and love. Her body is greater than the night sky, her many legs taller than the trees. And her hunger is fathomless. \n\nThis is why we must honor her nightly with burnings and bonfires. All moths crave the light, as do we, her faithful children. Her mysteries unveil themselves to us in the flickering of flames, the twinkling of stars, the light in the dark. We can never hope to curb her hunger, so measly are our offerings.\n\nSo instead, we must take on her desire as our own. We join the light with joy. Our pyres grow bigger, burn hotter. As the flames lick across our skin, we feel no pain, just the gentle nuzzling of Mother Moth's tongue, as we burn for her, lighting the darkness.\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE SERPENT\nSpeak not of the Serpent with those who have not tasted the briny depths themselves. Speak not of the Serpent with those whose feet have never left the land. Speak not of the Serpent unless you wish to meet its maw with courage and glory.\n\nSpeak not of the Serpent.\n\nPraise not the Serpent unless you have helmed a ship through its scaly undulations. Praise not the Serpent unless you have heard its roar above the crashing sea. Praise not the Serpent until it has spared you from a watery grave.\n\nPraise not the Serpent.\n\nSeek not the Serpent until you have sailed for many seasons in many waters. Seek not the Serpent until your body grows heavy with age. Seek not the Serpent until you have no other voyages left.\nSeek not the Serpent. The Serpent seeks you.\n\nEmbrace its wild, salt-brined fins, its vast body of sinew and scales, its teeth of sharp-edged bone. As your body will one day fill the Serpent, so too will you be filled in turn.\n\nTHE GOAT CULT\nThe Frostwood is not so barren as the village wants to believe. I have seen things there. Bigger than game, bigger than bears. There are monsters in that wood. They demand sacrifice.\n\nI have brought many gifts to the Goat That Walks Upright. He has feasted by my side, blood dripping down his wiry beard as his strange, horizontal pupils narrow and his claws plunge into my offerings of meat and fish. \n\nI have brought others to the Goat That Walks Upright. Some screamed and tried to run. Poor fools. The Goat That Walks Upright is always faster than they are, his cloven hooves and muscled legs covering the ground far faster than they ever could. That is his beauty, his mystery.\n\nA few others have seen his glory. Their faces transform from terror to wonder to awe. Together, we will bring more offerings, more followers, to our great god. The Goat That Walks Upright must be fed. Must be honored. These are his woods. We live by his will alone.
{{21337012-0-8146:}}Preserved by Gollred. According to family traditions, this text was written by his ancestor Uruld. The exact date is unknown.\n\nA wave of insipid rumors have been filling the minds of our youth with flights of fancy. We cannot tolerate this. Ours is a life of cold and survival. A constant struggle to hunt, to forage enough food to fill our bellies. To find wood to keep our fires lit overnight. We cannot allow the young folk to become distracted by these fanciful tales of beastfolk! \n\nTherefore, I have made it my duty to disprove all these rumors with the well of logic gifted to me by the Divines and great age. If, after reading this, you still believe in Fauns and Lamia and such, then I apologize. There is no more I can do for you. I hope you remember my fervent attempt to save you when your daydreaming results in a lean season and a rumbling belly.\n\nARGONIANS AND KHAJIIT\n\nWe start of course with the beastfolk that do exist. These distant travelers, so different from our ways, are why the children think these others might walk or fly or swim through the world. Khajiiti traders carry stories from afar to fill the minds of our young with strange and flighty ideas. Argonians speak of their talking trees and lands so warm the soil weeps with water. They are real, do not think me close minded. But they have brought trouble to our villages with their stories and songs. Real! But trouble.\n\nLILMOTHIIT\n\nLet's start with these stories of fox folk. Utter hogs wallop. Recall that large Khajiit woman who said she was a Pahmar? Her head scraped the underside of the cabins and she could lift a wagon on her own! If she is a Khajiit, then surely Khajiit can look all kinds of ways. I refuse to be deceived by those who wish to prank me by making up new things when the real world is so fanciful. Not real.\n\nLAMIA\n\nMore tall tales based on real folk. Tell me, you saw a scaled lizard person who lived near water? Sounds exactly like an Argonian to me. Perhaps you just could not see their legs, did not think to call out and say hello? Let us not be so ready to perceive slight differences in one folk and decide they are now two. Unwise and unkind, if you ask me. Not real. \n\nCENTAURS AND FAUNS\n\nHorsefolk have tainted the tales in the local tavern and childrens' games as well. I must deal with talk of centaurs! Half-man, half horse? Mounted riders seen through aging eyes, mark my words. Fauns are the same. Tales of their existence spread by the unreliable. There is nothing in the tales of fauns that could convince me that they are not goats as seen by inebriated druids. Not real.\n\nBIRDFOLK\n\nOne of those Elsweyr traders I mentioned could not stop telling stories about these feathered folk. Avian men and women with talons and the capacity for speech? Shor's bones! If birds are beastfolk, then I will eat a boar's droppings! We all know the birds featured in the traveling shows, colorful creatures that can mimic speech. Surely these birdfolk stories comes from the mouths of less thoughtful people seeing these chatty birds. Not real.\n\nSLOAD, DREUGH, HADOLIDS, AND WHAT ALL\n\nWherever sailors and fisherfolk come together to tell tales, we hear of fanciful beastfolk roaming far and wide. I've been down to the edge of the water, so you cannot fool me. The sea is constantly in motion. What one sailor sees out of the corner of their eye may look to be a dreaded great toad beast or a crab man. But in truth? Nothing more than a rock or figment of their imagination. If nothing else, just look to how many of these supposed sea folk the sailors like to regale us with. Seems quite suspect, as if these ship hands just cannot help but top one another with taller and taller tales. Not real!\n\nIMGA\n\nAs for the last classifications of beastfolk, we have rude descriptions of folk unknown in the wider world. Remember, my age and the Divines allow me great insight. Have you ever seen a person from Valenwood? They dress quite strangely and smell of the distant forests. These "Imga," ape folk, don't you see? Wood Elves seen by people without my expansive mind. Imagine being so wrong, so close-minded that you see a person from another land and decide to imagine them as a fanciful creature. To immortalize their appearance and vilify them. Needless to say! Not real!\n\nConsider this, young people. Think of my words. I hope my pleas will dissuade and preserve the minds of the youth. I have done all I can. I only hope that they see the sense in my logic and desist with these fanciful tales. Focus on the now, young ones. Lest the winter take you.

{{21337012-0-8159:}}So, you want to read a secret about netches? Well, who better to act as an authority on this than the definite Netch? The smaller and less luminous of my kind are much too preoccupied with buoyant matters to offer up their own wisdom. \n\nThis is the best kept secret of Oblivion. Netches control the ebb and flow of magicka. Who else is aerial enough to feel the tides of power? Most other creatures are tied to the ground.

Our extremities are formed specifically to appreciate the power coursing through Oblivion. \n\nWe keep this a secret, of course. It doesn't serve our purpose at all to make this widely known. After all, if we can sense the flow of etheric energies, who's to say that we can't influence them? Plant ourselves in the course of the tide and, by proximity, change its direction? Not me.

{{21337012-0-7891:}}Another typical day in Ontus. I will say that the increased output from the Carvain Ranch and the Raxalee Quarry has been impressive. I don't know what the ranch overseer and the quarry boss are feeding their workers, but whatever they're doing lately is certainly paying dividends.\n\nThe town healer, Nevama, reports another worker has come down with a debilitating fever. Stress? Overwork? I asked her to keep me updated.\n\n* * *\nBroke up a fight at the Stonechip. Gamblers arguing over the outcome of a game. Ghrakug didn't want me to make a fuss, so I just sent the combatants back to their parts of town with a warning.\n\nThree more workers have come down with what the healer is referring to as fatigue fever, two from the ranch and one from the quarry. Blames it on exhaustion. I should speak with the overseer and quarry boss about maybe scaling back a little on their current work pace.\n\n* * *\nThe healer gave me a rundown on the effects of this mysterious illness. The inflicted become extremely tired and too weak to move. A terrible fever grips them and they become delusional as they burn with sickness. As the illness progresses, they fall into a deep sleep from which she can't awaken them. And all this from workers who were extremely strong and healthy the last time she checked on them. Very strange.\n\n* * *\nThe first four workers who fell ill died today. Two worked at the ranch, and two worked at the quarry. The healer can't put her finger on the cause as yet, but she is concerned that both the ranch and the quarry seem affected. So far, no one who doesn't work at either of these places has come down with this fatigue fever.\n\n* * *\nI visited the ranch and the quarry on my rounds today. Even with a third of their workforce down with fatigue fever, both enterprises were fully engaged and appeared to be thriving. I never saw old Gelw Vashreef heft such a large crate of stone before or move so quickly. And Dalenn Forster at the ranch put on a show with how fast she loaded the wagons bound for the market in Skingrad. It was almost uncanny.\n\n* * *\nMore deaths from fatigue fever. The healer explained that at the end, the fever led to convulsions and foaming at the mouth before death finally took them. And I heard that Gelw and Dalenn have come down with the illness. I wish we could help them all somehow.\n\n* * *\nHealer Nevama sent me a note that she thinks she figured out something important about fatigue fever. I'm going to go meet with her now.\n\n* * *\nI arrived to find the healer on the floor, gripped by convulsions and foaming at the mouth. She died in my arms, the first person not directly tied to the ranch or the quarry to succumb to fatigue fever. Her healer's log was missing. This is now looking more and more like a crime, not just a simple illness. I need to determine what she was going to tell me before she was silenced.\n\n* * *\nI've set up appointments to talk to Ranch Overseer Merrarq, Quarry Boss Laurina, and Ghrakug at the Stonechip. After that, I plan to interview Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee about whatever processes led to their increased productivity and how it could be connected to fatigue fever. If someone did cause this illness and killed all these people, including the healer, I will see them brought to justice.
{{21337012-0-7898:}}by Melbora, Wilderhall Scholar\n\nI've organized these notes as you requested, spinner. The history of our clan goes back long enough to fill volumes. I've tried to keep things simple as I can.\n\nWhile the village of Vashabar was founded only a few short months ago, many of the families in our clan can trace their lineage to after the fall of the Ayleid Empire but before the Alessian Empire's dissolution. It is somewhat amazing that these same families stayed together when they migrated to Valenwood so long ago. Though we have always been a small community, you can see the tracks of history wending their way through our bloodlines. \n\nA number of our most important early community members were part of the Heartland Elf diaspora, though many of these former conquerors adopted the teachings of the Green Pact.\n\nOur tradition of Greenspeaking, perfecting the techniques of shaping the forest, stem from early in the Second Era. One of our own, an ancestor of Nedolir, developed techniques that would lead (eventually) to the cultivation of seedpod houses across Valenwood.\n\nThe tradition of dawnwalking that would eventually lead to the Dawnway movement is a more recent development, though it has its roots in our Ayleid ancestors. When King Nantharion adapted the movement and began bringing our community into clearer focus, we were more than ready to make the move when the Green showed us a way to return to our roots across the Strid.\n\nThe new forest seemed like it was grown specifically for us, so that we could reclaim the heritage of our Ayleid ancestors. You know the rest. We packed up and followed King Nantharion to this sacred spot and the greenspeakers got to work. It wasn't long before the first tendrils of Vashabar were grown.
{{21337012-0-7899:}}Nantharion,\n\nWhat in the Green are you up to? I'm livid! I'm sitting here reading your damned manifesto, and hearing reports of all this growth and movement … are you trying start another war, boy?

I want you or a representative here in Elden Root yesterday, do you hear me? The governors and magistrates that make up the Thalmor are demanding answers, and I can't keep stalling. \n\nYour family and I go way back, son, you know as well as I do that we're always on a thin branch with these people. Please don't make my job any harder than it already is. \n\nYou're a loyal subject of Valenwood. I know it. I expect to hear from you soon.\n\n- King Camoran Aeradan, Elden Root
{{21337012-0-7784:}}By Tacitan Vano\n\nI have been many things in my life. Soldier of fortune, innkeep, gambler. Even a hired escort for certain Nibenese ladies of high standing. But three summers past, I found myself with an urgent need to leave the Imperial City, and me without a coin in my purse.\n\nIn desperation, I hired myself out as a guard to the first west-bound merchant caravan I could find. My new employer was a grizzled, one-eyed Argonian called Teeba-Tei. I could tell she had her doubts, but she simply shrugged. "Two crowns and two meals a day," she offered. "If we reach Anvil with all our cargo intact, I'll pay a twenty-crown bonus and hire you again for the return trip."\n\nI'd hoped for higher wages, but I was in no position to negotiate. I agreed and we set out shortly thereafter.\n\nTeeba-Tei's caravan consisted of three wagons, six guar, and a half-dozen drivers and guards. Olive oil, pickled eel, and bolts of ancestor silk packed in wooden trunks made up her cargo. I soon learned my employer expected her hired guards to walk, not ride. I was already footsore by the time we reached the end of the bridge over Lake Rumare!\n\nAt Weye, we turned south on the Red Ring Road, following the lake shore until we reached the Gold Road. That night we camped at an old Imperial milegate, where Teeba-Tei told me she expected guards to stand watch. Rather glum about the prospect of days spent walking and nights spent not sleeping, I considered abandoning the whole situation. But at least the food was decent.\n\nThe Gold Road was a river of wagons and travelers. My feet hurt, yes, but the weather was fine and the scenery was rather pretty. On our second day, we paused by a place where crumbling ruins towered beside the road, and I started to wander that way for a closer look.\n\n"Not a good idea," Teeba-Tei advised me. "The Gold Road is safe enough here, but danger lurks on all sides. Goblins, beasts, bandits. And stranger perils."\n\n"Stranger perils? Like what?" I asked.\n\nTeeba-Tei pointed at the ruins. "That is Ceyatatar. Ayleid ghosts haunt the place and are known to burn the curious alive."\n\n"I'm not that curious after all," I said, and returned to the road.\n\nAs the days passed, my feet toughened and I came to enjoy the camaraderie of the caravan. Vlastarus, Skingrad, Ostumir, Kvatch—one by one the cities and towns of the Strid Vale came up to meet us as we made our way ever westward. The Gold Road ran through endless fields of ripening grain, charming orchards, and belts of shady forest.\n\nAt Gottshaw Inn, we crossed from West Weald into the Gold Coast proper. For the first time in days, we slept indoors. I was grateful for the respite, but Teeba-Tei was ill at ease when we rose the next morning. "What's the trouble?" I asked.\n\n"Strangers at the inn last night," she answered. "They were asking questions about our cargo. Be vigilant today. They could be bandits planning an ambush."\n\nWest of the inn, the Gold Road veers away from the Strid Vale into the Colovian foothills. Few people live in the area, and fellow travelers were few and far between. I gripped my sword hilt at every thicket we passed, but to no avail. The bandits Teeba-Tei feared ambushed us in a ravine a few hours later.\n\n"Drop your arms, surrender the wagons, and you'll live!" their leader called down from the rocks above.\n\n"Come and take them, dryskin!" Teeba-Tei shouted before I could open my mouth and urge a more cautious response. And that's exactly what the bandits did.\n\nOld Teeba-Tei fought like a lion before she was felled by a quarrel in the back. Several of my newfound comrades fell as well, and the drivers of our last two wagons fled. They drove like a Dragon was chasing them, back toward Kvatch. The few brigands still standing pursued them. I managed to avoid serious injury, more by chance than skill. I'm a lover, not a fighter.\n\nWhen the dust settled, I found myself forgotten in the ravine beside our lead wagon, and none but the guar and the dead for company. Clearly Teeba-Tei would not complete her journey to Anvil, nor would she be able to pay me. But two trunks of fine silk remained in the wagon, and the road before me was clear.\n\n"Farewell, Teeba-Tei," I told my former employer. Then I took the reins and drove to Anvil to sell the silk. With the profits, I bought a cargo of my own. And so began my career as a merchant.\n\n What can I say? They call it the Gold Road for a reason!
{{21337012-0-8022:}}A completely true account of Ulfsild's favorite Luminary.\n\nSome sought the power of the Indrik: prodigious yawners who lacked imagination, drawn to power and might.\n\nSome sought the power of the Dragon—Supposed orators who prized their own voices, never letting the thought of another pass without interjection.\n\nSome sought the power of the Gryphon—Like-minded individuals obsessed with their own ideas, blind to the fact there was nothing unique about them.\n\nFor everyone else, truly righteous and buoyant souls, there was the Netch. Dashing. Cunning. Splendid and shapely. All who knew the Netch had their lives made lighter and brighter by its mere presence. When someone tried to do something prodigiously stupid, like trading an island sanctuary for a silly book, the Netch's lithe tendrils would guide him gently back to doing something more productive, like cherishing his wife, or cleaning his fingernails with a hot iron poker, or literally anything else.\n\nThe other Luminaries groveled. "Oh, great and glorious Netch!" they said. "We beseech you to aid us in lifting the green boulders of envy rolled over our hearts. Let our bosoms float with such lightness as your bosom. Make our voluptuous dreams come true!" \n\n"I will of course use my magic," said the wise and benevolent Netch, "to keep you from holding yourselves to my frankly unfair standard of luminescence."\n\nThe Netch did this. The followers of the other Luminaries saw the Netch in all its glory and decided to turn their hearts to it instead. The Luminaries were so happy for this! The Netch basked in all their loving attention, and everyone everywhere was happy and fulfilled and wanted for nothing.

{{21337012-0-8074:}}To Legion High Command or whatever officer finds this.\n\nI, Legionary Ulrath, write these words as the last surviving soldier in Captain Dartorius's patrol. We faced a superior force of Daedra and made a good showing, but in the end only I remain. Well, me and the captain, tusk her eyes!\n\nWe were on patrol near Fort Hastrel when we stumbled into an ambush set for us by the Daedra. If the captain had followed my suggestion and sent scouts ahead of the patrol, we might have spotted the trap earlier. As it was, the entire patrol was taken by surprise before we could act.\n\nAt this point we all turned to the captain for orders, but she seemed dumbfounded. No orders were forthcoming, so I took command and began to order our squadron to make for the nearby fort. Captain Dartorius emerged from her stupor and countermanded my order, instead telling the squadron to charge directly into the teeth of the enemy. As the soldier made to comply, the captain turned her mount and began to make her own escape, using her own soldiers to cover her retreat.\n\nHere, I admit, I acted on instinct and in something of a rage. I struck out at the captain, hitting her a glancing blow that knocked her from her mount. Then I turned and joined the squadron, calling for a retreat to the fort as we engaged in a running battle with the enemy.\n\nI want you to know that each and every legionary fought with all their hearts and souls. The enemy knew they had been in a fight, even as I watched each soldier around me eventually fall. A few of us finally made it to the keep and were able to drive off the remaining Daedra, but not a single remaining legionary was unscathed. Soon, all succumbed to their wounds. All except me.\n\nSo, read my account. Decide if my actions were appropriate or wrong as you see fit. I know I did my duty. I know I fought to save our squadron. I know Captain Dartorius's fear and cowardice got her patrol killed.\n\nWhatever you decide, I am done. I no longer care. I know the word of a legionary will not stand against that of a captain. I accept this. But by my oath as a legionary, everything I wrote here is true.
{{21337012-0-8072:}}There were stories of unusual fortune and luck. Riches found by the poor. Love found by the lonely.  Vvardenfell was abuzz with these tales. The so-called miracles were not replicable by the Tribunal and caught the attention of the clergy. Priest Lucilan intended to find the source of these mysterious blessings.\n\nLucilan first visited a farming village in the grazelands. There, a child had run away from home to an island southeast of town. It was a dangerous place, full of monsters. But when the search party found the boy, he was sitting among a flock of pecking hens. The child said a Netch had rained on each monster that approached and turned them into chickens. The village held a feast and dined on the birds, which were filling but tasted of sulfur. For a generation after this, the island remained empty of monsters.\n\n|c990000This must be near the northeasterly town of Vos. There's a Daedric ruin on an island nearby  devoted to Molag Bal, just southeast of the town. I'll start there first.|r\n\nFrom there, Lucilan went northwest around Red Mountain, then south to a stonewood riparian settlement. He met a caravanner who had no coin to spare just a fortnight ago, as she was deep in debt. Now, she was offering rides to passengers for free.\n\n|c990000Riparian settlement? A city on the banks of a river, southwest of Red Mountain. Has to be Balmora. |r\n\nLucilan asked her to explain this reversal of her fortune. She said that while waiting for a passenger on the riverbank, a Netch floated up from the water, spooking her silt strider into the deepest part of the river. The creature panicked and quickly went under. When the caravanner dove in after it, she found a passenger ship that had gone missing years ago. She saved her silt strider and recovered a shipment of treasured jewels, more than enough to cover her debt. \n\nLucilan pleaded for the caravanner to tell him more about the strange Netch, but she said nothing.\n\nAfter this, Lucilan spent many lonely months on the road when he realized he had wandered in a circle. He ventured next to the Zainab in the grazelands, where locals pointed him to a ruin in the foothills of Red Mountain.\n\n|c990000Going in a circle means we're back in the northeast. It's a Dwemer ruin, something that sounds like a sneeze. Nchuleft.|r\n\nInside the ruins he found an elder Ashlander talking to the air as if he spoke to a grandchild.\n\n"Who are you talking to?" Lucilan asked. The elder explained that when he was an explorer in these ruins, he fell from one of the bridges. It would surely be the end of him, but before he landed in the lava below, a set of pale tendrils caught him. They set him safely back on the ground. Since that day, he had returned to the ruins whenever he wanted to feel that familiar presence. In fact, his Netch friend was floating near Lucilan now. He was surprised Lucilan didn't feel the tendril on his shoulder or the feeling of weightless joy brought on by the Netch.\n\nLucilan left with haste. But when he returned to his order, his findings were deemed insufficient. Despite this, Priest Lucilan would not let go of the idea of the Netch and was ridiculed for this belief.\n\nAt last, wandering among the islands on Azura's Coast, he saw the ghostly pale Netch, neither animal nor spirit. The miserable Lucilan could finally see the Netch, too. And he felt buoyant.\n\n|c990000I'd bet anything Lucilan found the door to the Netch's realm near the old wizard towers on the coast, Sadrith Mora. I'll have to look into it.|r

They have been most useful in helping us translate and cross-check many of the editions we have already uncovered. We have found tomes in Old Aldermeris, Atmoran, Yokudan, the Nedic languages, and even variations of Orcish. We've even uncovered metal plates covered with Dwemer runes, but confirming this and deciphering them will require extensive research.\n\nWork proceeds slowly on the cataloging and translation of the works. Part of it is due the environment—the Scholarium itself has been plagued with high humidity and water damage, and many of the more ancient volumes are in perilous condition, suffering from decay. \n\nIn addition, there was a plague of booklice and paper weevils in the western wing that has damaged some irreplaceable volumes. This is no doubt a function of the lengthy period the Scholarium spent in the Shivering Isles! I've attached (in a separate message) a new copy of my treatise on Daedric realms and their impact on Nirnian pest creatures. I'm sure you'll find it a most enjoyable read!\n\nI have also passed along a request (sent by separate messenger) for a variety of cleansers and preservation supplies.

A few are in secret code, or even some combination of the three. As a result, a great deal of effort will be required before we fully identify and unlock their many secrets.\n\nPlease consult the list (sent by separate courier) of more recent tomes and histories that we can use here to check against those found in the Scholarium.

{{21337012-0-8184:}}By Kraltha the Rememberer\n\nFor many years, the Orcs of the Hollow Wastes held strong against the Ra Gada. But year after year the Redguard kingdoms of the coast grew stronger, while the holds of the desert Orcs fell one by one.\n\nIn that time, the warrior-chief Thulgeg came of age. He looked to the north, the west, and the south, and said to his people, "Our enemies surround us, and still our clans bicker with each other. We must stand together under one banner, or be defeated alone."\n\nThe desert clans heard Thulgeg, and gathered their strength. When a host from Hegathe marched against the hold of Clan Korkhugg, Thulgeg brought all the desert clans to Korkhugg's defense. He dealt the Redguards of Hegathe a sharp defeat, driving them back to their stone-walled city. In token of his victory, the assembled chiefs named him Warlord and swore to follow wherever he led.\n\nThulgeg, however, perceived the seeds of defeat in victory. Even united, the clans lacked the strength to overwhelm Hegathe's walls. The Warlord stood upon a hill looking down at the city, and thought long before he came down again.\n\n"Our homeland is a house with three open doors," Thulgeg said to the desert chiefs. "The sea rings our desert on three sides. We cannot win a war against enemies who can come against us from all directions at once. But in the east, we can put our backs to the mountains. We must win our survival with our feet, not our spears."\n\nHeavy were the hearts of those who heard Thulgeg speak, but they knew he was right. While the Redguards mustered their strength, the desert clans took apart their forges and gathered all that could be carried. Then Thulgeg led them east. Many Goblin tribes joined their ranks, swelling their numbers.\n\nThrough the canyons of Tigonus Thulgeg marched, a journey filled with thirst and suffering equal to any battle. In the Fallen Wastes, the Redguards of Hel Ra sought to stop him. But Thulgeg led a vanguard of a thousand warriors against the foes in their way, and cleaved a path for the desert clans following him.\n\nTurning north, Thulgeg came to the gates of Bangkorai, hoping to cross the mountains before the pass could be held against him. Alas, word of Thulgeg's march had run ahead of his clans, and the men of High Rock stood ready to defend the pass. Once again, Thulgeg hurled his warriors against his foes, but after a long day of battle the defenses still held.\n\nWith a great Redguard host gathering at his heels, Thulgeg knew he was caught between the hammer and anvil. He called his chiefs together. "We cannot stay, but we cannot leave foes behind us," he told them. "Let our clans march on to the mountains under cover of darkness, but leave our campfires burning. I will remain behind with five hundred warriors so that our foes believe we are still here."\n\nThe clans did as the Warlord commanded. For three days, Thulgeg feigned assault after assault, keeping the men of High Rock behind their walls and drawing the Redguard host north to Bangkorai while the desert clans retreated into the mountains. Only then did Thulgeg and those few who survived make their own escape.\n\nWhen the Redguard host came to the deserted camp before the walls of Bangkorai, they saw the dead and they saw the abandoned tents. There they stopped, believing they had destroyed the desert clans to the last Orc. But the Warlord's people survived, and in time Thulgeg led them to Wrothgar where they helped lay the foundations of Orsinium.

They have made quite a difference in resolving the many problems that have arisen in maintaining these ancient texts. I will send along some transcriptions of the oldest works for your consideration, but strongly recommend that unique volumes remain within the Scholarium. They are quite fragile with age, to the point that some disintegrate when the covers are first opened. \n\nIn addition to the delicate volumes, the adepts have been challenged by the state of storage and shelving. Some shelves have practically rotted out through the intermittent dampness. Others suffer from dry rot to the point that an entire shelving unit collapsed the other evening, almost crushing poor Votary Nahlia!\n\nWe've also found a number of unreadable volumes, and the adepts are split as whether they contain highly personal magical notations or some sort of cipher used to secure their secrets. \n\nMy personal opinion is that we are looking at some sort of heretofore unknown Ehinofex daughter language, which, if proven true, would be revolutionary for understanding of pre-Nedic tongues. Ehinofex and its descendant languages are another personal interest of mine, as you are no doubt aware, and I've sent along a new copy of my paper on the descendant declensional pathway that leads from the earliest languages to the poetry of Ayleidoon-era Elves.

{{21337012-0-7997:}}By Antonious Civello, University of Gwylim Press\n\nSkingrad, the Gem of Old Colovia, is one of the oldest continual settlements within West Weald, with evidence of habitation going back to Elven settlements of the Methic Age. Sprawling over several rocky outcroppings and connected by bridges, the city is eminently defensible, and has expanded and contracted over its long history. Regardless, throughout the years the city has remained a center of creative activity, food, and culture. Its temperate climate and fertile soil makes it ideal for grapes and tomatoes, and its cheese-making is renowned throughout the continent.\n\nSkingrad was without a doubt originally an Ayleid settlement, though no written records found so far confirm that. Excavations for new structures often reveal buried foundations, underground passages, and mosaic floors long hidden from the light, all with the High Elven style. Humans were also present, as evidenced by more humble dwellings and carvings, and were most likely Nedic people. As time passed \n\nFollowing the Alessian Revolt of the Nedic peoples and the slow diaspora of the elves, Skingrad passed into the hands of human rulers. During this time Skingrad was established as one of the many petty kingdoms which owed their vassalage to the White-Gold Tower but remained independent. With the cities of Anvil, Chorrol, and Kvatch, they formed the nucleus of the Colovian Estates, and resisted much of influence of the rising Alessian Order. \n\nMatters came to a head when the royal family of Skingrad was almost completely wiped out by plague, and the senior surviving member, Dorald Larich, an Alessian priest, ceded the kingdom to the First Empire. Another surviving prince, Rislav Larich of Kvatch, led a force against the city and overthrew and killed King Dorald. Emperor Gorius dispatched an army to Skingrad, but those forces were destroyed by Rislav's army, supported by his father-in-law, King Justinius of Kvatch. The defeat of the all-powerful imperial forces encouraged other city-states to rebel, and Colovia and the other western parts of empires fractured into smaller kingdoms, sometimes allied with each other, sometimes battling.\n\nSkingrad maintained its status as an independent state for centuries but was eventually absorbed into the Reman Empire as the men of Tamriel united to repel the first Akaviri invasion. During the period of the Remans, Skingrad became more closely tied to Cyrodiil. The fourth Reman Emperor, Brazallus Dor, maintained a country estate nearby, and spent much of his rule engaged in feasts and other debaucheries, allowing his potentate to run the empire. This era established the city as a hub for culture, supported by the fine vineyards that had grown up around it. Emperor Dor is said to have died on his estate following a particularly intense set of debaucheries.\n\nSkingrad became an ally of Duke Varen Aquilarios in his bid to overthrow the last of the Longhouse Emperors, Leovic. With Varen's ascendency to the throne, Skingrad rejoined the Empire as a vassal state, swearing allegiance to the Ruby Throne.\n\nIn the present-day, Skingrad is officially part of the Empire, but has not chosen to side with any particular alliance in the Three Banners War. They aggressively protect their neutrality and maintain several cohorts of the Imperial Legion to protect their borders. This aggressive neutrality has not kept the current count, Calantius, from launching his forces in an ill-considered assault on Reaper's March. Regardless, these actions have not dampened the cultured, independent spirit of the people of Skingrad, and it remains the jewel of West Weald.

{{21337012-0-8048:}}By Sonolia Vatia, scribe to the court of Emperor Brazollus Dor\n\nWith the fall of the Ayleid empire and the rise of the Alessian, not all Daedric-worshipping Ayleid rulers were overthrown. Some Ayleid leaders, sympathetic to the fate of the former human slaves, swore fealty to Allesia and her rebels, while others laid down their weapons with the fall of the Gold Tower. \n\nOver time, these surviving kingdoms slowly devolved and human rulers (and their worship of the Aedra) spread. For about a hundred years, both cultures survived within the new empire, but with the ascendency of the Alessian Order, however, persecution of Daedric worshipers increased. Ultimately the last of the Ayleid vassal city-states, Nenalata, was given an ultimatum—evacuate or be eliminated. Their ruler, King Dynar Lalloriaran, led the evacuees from their city. Those that remained were massacred by the order. Dynar fled with two of the symbols of his office—his crown and scepter. His staff-like emblem was guarded by loyal retainers, but disappeared in the flight.\n\nKing Dynar and his people fled to High Rock, where they found safety with the High Elf Direnni clan. He founded the city of Bisnensel, but was driven from it as well and fled to the island of Balfiera, where he became a military advisor to Clan Direnni. He fought in the Battle of Glenumbra Moors, which crushed the power of the Alessian Order.\n\nKing Dynar is said to have returned to Cyrodiil, but disappears from the historic narrative. His emblem, crown, and scepter are lost to time. The towers and keeps of the Ayleids are nothing more than overgrown ruins, and their peoples scattered throughout the land. In this there is a warning for all empires. Nothing lasts forever, and time is the ultimate victor.
{{21337012-0-8049:}}This is my most inscribed journal. If your name is not Melus Marsicus then direct your prying-est of eyes elsewhere for you are encroaching on my most secretive of thoughts.\n\nFew theories prevail concerning the exactitudes of the arcane knot. We know not what it is, whence it came, its function, form, or fashion. The name itself, arcane knot, gives little information and leaves much to be desired—especially considering the lack of confirmation that the knot is even knotted. To outline the myriad hypotheses regarding the knot would be as factual as outlining the folktales of Grahtwood. There is no sense in proclaiming those as facts or invoking them in a hallowed paper such as my journal. No, I will be consigning myself to the truth, and its upholdment. \n\nWhere does the name arcane knot even come from? A select few Daedra in Fargrave are able to claim memory from the era when the citadel was in use, though they are reticent to divulge any other morselettes of information. Still, with the lack of knowledge being readily shared, I suppose I must accept the name and keep it as an indication of proof that the arcane knot exists. \n\nPerhaps the knot is the reason for the citadel's ruinous appearance and dilapidated visage. Surely structures like the citadel, though old, are built to withstand the shifting sand. I have seen countless examples of Daedric architecture survive after eons in muck, murk, and lava pools. But no, the citadel is sinking into the dessert of Fargrave and offers no resistance to this fate. If there is an object at the heart of this fortressorial disappearance, it may as well be the arcane knot. \n\nWill I be the one to find the arcane knot? While others slave deeper inside the citadel, searching rooms for hidden doors, appealingly disguised compartments, and the other trappings of an adventure most grand, I am here in with my best shovel. Oh yes, after this lengthy and unproductive break during which I am giving my sore back some respite, I will continue digging for the knot. I refuse to listen to the other's fearmongering when they say that the knot cannot be buried here of all places. I am resolute in my position, and nothing will get me to leave until I have unsanded the knot.

{{21337012-0-8128:}}By Pantea Maria, Imperial Animal Trainer\n\nCongratulations! You are the proud owner of a bear cub. Whether it be a brown, black, snow, svongarde or sunback, your new pet should provide years of joy and loyal companionship. Here are some helpful hints in raising and training your new friend!\n\nFeeding: Bears are omnivores and can eat both plants and meat. After emerging from hibernation, wild bears survive on berries and scavenge winter-killed elk, deer, and other mammals. They like fish, including dried fish. Regardless, it is strongly advised to have a regular source of foodstuffs available. Bears have their own personal preferences, so feel free to experiment with various foods to find out what your bear likes. \n\nWaste: Bears, indeed, dispose of their waste in the woods. Be prepared to have sufficient measures taken, either in an outdoor lifestyle or with sufficient employees to handle matters. Bears can be housebroken, but this proves to be a chancy operation at best. Patience is advised.\n\nActivity: Bears like to engage with their environment, and some owners like to let them roam free in rural settings. Those kept as pets in more civilized areas should have sufficient room to exercise, and, should situations permit it, a keeper to tend to their needs. Bears can sprint faster than humans, so keep that in mind when engaging in horseplay.\n\nHibernation: Bears kept in captivity, with an ample amount of food, do not hibernate. However, as a result, they may gain excess weight, which would normally be burned off during the winter sleep. Plan your bear's meals accordingly.\n\nDiscipline: Bears are by nature curious and inquisitive, and can often be destructive, particularly when food is involved. Start early when training your bear and let them know when they are breaking the rules. Be firm with your bear but recognize that it is at heart a wild creature, and may not adapt well to domesticity.\n\nOlder Bears: Bear cubs are affectionate and cute. As they mature, bears may prove to be harder to handle. Some may be trained as mounts and serve alongside their masters for years (living up to 50 years in captivity), while some prove untrainable and must be returned to the wild.

"I thought they took you back to the Crow's Wood!" she cried. "I didn't realize they understood my thieves' cant." \n\n"I'm all right," Gray said, brushing her off. "But you're spending gold we don't have, drinking like that. The Gryphon's treasure is worth nothing unless we can find all three pieces. Are you listening, Riah?" \n\nZariah was not listening. Her eyes had that light from before, and she felt around like she was grasping at starlight. "It's here!" she said. "Here in the city!"\n\nGray looked around. "How is that possible? It must have been placed here before there was a town here." He peered down into the dark canal. "Maybe even before there was a lake."\n\n|c990000Lake Honrich, I presume. He speaks of Riften. |r\n\n"Sai is with us," said Zariah. She broke the wards and revealed the treasure just as dawn broke and drove back the shadows. \n\n"Only one more piece," said Gray, "until we find the door and the Gryphon very likely kills us." \n\n"Or," countered Zariah, "all we need to do is step out of the way. Let his talons contend with the Lady of the Night. I don't seek the power of this mythical creature, only the means to let us live a life where we don't have to keep running."\n\nGray looked up at her with shining eyes. "It is not too late for me to go back." But Zariah would not hear it. "No, my friend. You are too kind and clever to be kept in a prison of shadows for all your days. This will work. I am certain of it."\n\n<A page is torn out.>\n\nbeneath Forelhost, for it had been hidden when the land was new.\n\n|c990000Beneath Forelhost. So not at Forelhost proper?

But in explaining as much, she had not watched where she was going, and trod into a circle of hibernating snow bears. \n\nZariah fled through the broad circuit of the caves, shouting to Gray where she saw the thumbprints on the face of Nirn and trusting her friend to recover the final piece of their treasure.\n\n|c990000I'll travel east of Riften to Forelhost and see if there is another cave or hollow nearby.

Though far from dusk, the site lay already in shadow of Hrothgar. Snow-buffed wind blew through the door, billowing Zariah's cloak and revealing the stolen treasure beneath\n\n|c990000Near dusk, already in shadow of Hrothgar—meaning a barrow close on the eastern side of the mountain's base. Ivarstead is built near one such place. |r\n\n"The Lady of Night would not know me, and therefore never move against me this way," said the Gryphon. But even then, doubt crept into his voice. He had spent an age in solitude and knew not of the Daedra, nor any of their kin. And already, they were surrounded by crows and tendrils of shadow.\n\n"We lied!" Gray cried, frightened and compelled to truthfulness. "I am her pet and sought escape. Zariah helped me. But the Lady of Night takes all things back in the dark." He peeked past the Gryphon into the doorway. "We will return your treasures and take all the more on your behalf if you give us sanctuary!"\n\nThe dark closed in like water, pooling around them, lapping at their feet. Zariah drew her weapons, defending Gray from tendrils of shadow. The Gryphon then judged her worthy of his boon of power, being both of great skill and courage, and loyal to her small friend.\n\nThe Gryphon raked his talons through the tendrils of shadow, but they had no quarrel with him, only the two thieves. "To my domain!" called the Gryphon, moving back to let them through the door at last. But it was too late. \n\nZariah held back the night's darkness with a thin tunnel of starlight, just wide enough for Gray to slip through. Then, using the boon of power the Gryphon had just given her, she sealed the door to the Gryphon's domain with Gray and the Gryphon on the far side.\n\nGray keened for Zariah. He pawed and scratched at the locked door until his nails bled.
{{21337012-0-8020:}}A hunter traveled through green waters to the break of dawn, seeking a worthy quarry. \n\nHe came across the Lady, stone-still with skirts pooled around her. \n\nSomething huddled behind her—a creature of hooves and feathers and bones of the earth. It barked and gave chase when he got too close.He chased it through mud and brush and down into the earth, by amber light of culanda in gleaming halls of moon-gray stone. The long-legged creature shed its even longer shadow, leaving it to do battle with the hunter. \n\nThe two met again among ruins of an isle brought low from the weight of a once-mighty tower. All that remained was a well of starlight at its center.The creature did not run, but considered the hunter as he approached.\n\n"Why did you chase me?" asked the creature.\n"I sought a worthy quarry," answered the hunter.\n"I was feeble and new to this world," said the creature. "Small and weak." \n"I would lose my sharpness in waiting for you to grow. And you had sense enough to run," said the hunter. "What use would that gift be if none ever chased you?"\n"Drink of this well with me," said the creature. "We were both made stronger by your pursuit."\n\nThe two foes bent their heads and drank of the well of starlight. Rejuvenated, they raised their heads as friends and ran again, dashing over the river, splashing through the Lady's skirts, stopping on a high overlook jutting out to the sea. \n\nWhat a difference it made, thought the hunter as he stepped into the creature's glade, keeping stride with another rather than following in their wake.

{{21337012-0-7837:}}Why did I ever agree to marry that woman? Yes, she comes with an impressive fortune and I can certainly use the money, but she is annoyingly curious and wants to be an actual partner in this marriage! That's not how I want to do things.\n\n* * *\nMy first few weeks as a vampire were challenging, but it wasn't long before I decided to take control of my destiny and make the most of my new condition. It wasn't hard to form my own coven out of the disgruntled among Bogvir's clan. Most of them hate that pushy vampire! Still, I have to hand it to Bogvir. He really hit a gold mine with that recipe he found in an old scroll. Too bad he isn't as good an alchemist as he is a bloodthirsty vampire. I, on the other hand, am a very good alchemist.\n\n* * *\nBack home in my own alchemical laboratory and the tests are going exceedingly well. Yes, some of the first subjects turned into bloodfiends, but you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. Of course, father has figured out what happened to me and is mad with grief and rage. I suppose I'll need to do something about that. He lived a long life, so I'll just consider it a mercy.\n\n* * *\nMy idea is finally paying off. While a vampire can't consume the elixir made from the mushrooms grown in vampire blood directly and survive long enough to reap the benefits, if the elixir is funneled through an intermediary, we receive the power without any of the poisonous effects. By floating the elixir in a solution of wine fermented from my alchemically prepared grapes seeds grown in soil enriched with the mushrooms, the wine can then be consumed by a non-vampire. This allows us to then feed off the non-vampire fortified with the wine and therefore receive the benefits of the elixir. The fact that we need to totally consume the vessel containing the wine is unfortunate, but acceptable. And the grapes give off a scent that makes vampires ravenous. At least two of my new clan defied my orders and consumed handfuls of the first harvest. They died horribly.\n\n* * *\nI call it Vesper Valente! A perfect vintage! Now to invite the leaders of nearby vampire covens to come bid on the wine. I'll make a fortune. Enough to keep the vineyards in operation, to keep my miserable wife happy until I dispose of her, and to keep my family legacy intact. And all while I gain power by consuming my own product. \n\nThrough any mortal vassals and victims I acquire, of course.

{{21337012-0-7857:}}Varen's Watch. I joined the Legion to findf adventure and excitement and where do they put me? As far from any action as you can get! I'm stationed at some crumbing old bastion that's only claim to fame is related to battles with Reachfolk about five years ago that wrecked this place. I suppose nobody thought the Watch important enough to fix up, because they haven't repaired much of anything. We're just supposed to make sure the signal fires are always ready in case we need to ignite them. I wonder who they expect to attack us out here. All the real action is happening over in Cyrodiil.\n\nBut I'm here. Guarding absolutely nothing.

{{21337012-0-8054:}}If this works, this is the official record that Cavot Agnan was the first spellcaster to successfully raise an undead army with the use of lucent crystals. But I am getting ahead of myself.\n\nWhile those other scavengers crawl around in the sand hoping to stumble across the arcane knot for Xoryn, I'm using my time slightly more productively. What all previous attempts to claim the arcane knot have failed with was a lack of numerical superiority. This is an entire citadel buried in the sands of Fargrave. No one is going to be able to effectively scour it for an object that few have seen and fewer can describe. \n\nI am going to use my magick and abilities to conjure an army of the dead so great that we could destroy and rebuild the entire citadel in a day. I will forge an army from the skeletons of all who failed here. The only issue being that I currently do not possess the strength to control that many reanimated minions. But I believe I have solved this issue in a clever and resourceful way. This is the Lucent Citadel. Lucents are used to store energies. Necromacy uses magick which is a type of energy. So, I can force the crystals which fill this fortress to act as conduits for my spells and use them as proxies for the army I am about to amass. \n\nIt's a good plan. I'm quite pleased with it. The only problem is that I'm not sure the lucents are as suited to house necrotic energies. I tried imbuing a few different crystals with my magick and they reacted in a strange way. They released the souls I intended to trap within them, or the energy rebounded and created pockets of ethereal energy in the room. A few lucents behaved appropriately, so I will continue my experiments and keep vigilant for any other unplanned expulsions of necrotic energy.
{{21337012-0-8053:}}I have to write this quickly and transfer it over to my personal book of notes after more of the chaos is over. So, for the record and for any prying eyes, this is Neletai's paper. Do not remove it or misplace it.\n\nDuring my first expedition with Xoryn, there was little of note about him. He was the usual stature for his kind—perhaps a little shorter than me, but nothing so remarkable as what I just witnessed. During his assault on our camp, I noticed that his dimensions doubled since last we met. But what could be the cause? Surely, he must have other objects of power or prominence in his collection. Perhaps exposure to one of those is to blame for the fact that he is nearly tall enough to match the height of his overinflated ego. \nThe only other explanation is that over the course of Xoryn's numerous futile expeditions into the citadel to retrieve the arcane knot, he somehow became warped by it's power and grew as a result? I thought it could be the lucent crystals themselves, but those are used commonly in Fargrave and none of the Daedra there have grown outrageously tall. \n\nI'll have to make a note of this development and see if any of Keshargo's camp return taller than they entered the citadel. If any of them are alive to continue the journey. Even now they're whimpering and calling out in fear. What a mess. I will go check on my null arca while I wait to see if any of the injured succumb. If Xoryn's battle destroyed my prototype, I may just seek him out myself.
{{21337012-0-8052:}}Recorded by Mercator Ambustus\nExpedition Day 27\n\nArrival at last! \n\nAfter weeks of trudging over countless sand dunes, we made it to the citadel. The walls are taller than I expected, but with the secrecy Seeker Manadra used to talk about the citadel, I'm not sure what I envisioned. From the few stories and theories Manadra shared, I never thought that the citadel would look as run down as it does. While the other bodyguards in our party boasted about leaving the hard work of walking the desert behind us, I can't shake the feeling that this decrepit fortress has more in store for us.\n\nSeeker Manadra is thrilled, though. He keeps checking his equipment and practicing incantations. He's making me nervous. This whole place is.\n\n We will rest and set off into the citadel when Manadra decides that it's time. If the quiet of the citadel has this much of an affect on me, I'll need the rest.\n\n<Several pages are missing.>\n\nExpedition Day 40 \n\nWe walked under a strange sky. I've seen many over the course of my time as a bodyguard, but few match the level of odd that this sky consistently produces. The colors and the shapes of the stars are unlike any seen on Nirn. If I ever needed proof of how far we traveled, all I need to do is look up. \n\nSeeker Manadra thinks we're getting closer to what he seeks. One of his instruments began to hum with energy after we entered through that last door, but the guardians attacked almost in the same moment. Even though none of Seeker Manadra's instruments gave any further indication of proximity after the battle, he took the momentary activity as a good sign. I guess we'll have to listen to his expertise. \n\nI, for one, am tired of the constant threat we face. The guardians are tenacious and have no need of rest. They are a constant plague on our energy levels. I hope Seeker Manadra is right and the knot is close. I want to be rid of this place.\n\n<More pages are torn or burnt>\n\nExpedition Day 45\n\nI must write quickly. The knot is not what we thought. It drains at us and eats away at us. I haven't held it yet, but Seeker Manadra says it's my turn next. We are not even a third of the way back to the entrance. The others are gone. They disappeared into the knot and haven't resurfaced. I don't know where they are. \n\nI don't want to be next, but Seeker Manadra is keeping an eye on me. I can't run. He's promised the others more gold to keep me in line. I can't fight them all. I fear I'm trapped. \n\nI don't want to hold the knot. It will swallow me.

{{21337012-0-8050:}}While my colleagues in the Saraathu Tong waste their time with the myriad questions and mysteries of Fargrave, I, Salora Adlaron, chose to spend it productively. In the name of this endeavor, I have selected one question to focus on. My journey has one goal, to uncover the origins of the lucent crystals which are integral to Fargrave's infrastructure. To clarify, the function of the lucent crystals is of little importance, instead I seek to understand how they form and where they originate.\n\nGiven that there are so many lucent crystals in Fargrave and what remains of its surrounding realm, its safe to assume that the crystals have some tie to this location. After all, they are not frequently found in the other planes of Oblivion. Thus, the crystals must be endemic to Fargrave. \n\nThe first theory I tested was that the crystals are born from the sands surrounding Fargrave itself. As I predicted, the process of heating this sand produced a sort of glass. Preliminary experiments show that the glass has some aesthetic merits, but none of the energy-storing properties of the lucent crystals. Unsurprised, I gave the glass to an artisan and returned to my notes.\n\nMy second theory, which I am in the process of testing now, is that the lucent crystals originate from a location outside Fargrave called the Lucent Citadel. As the name suggests, there are a plethora of lucent crystals in the citadel, but finding a large quantity of crystals is not the same as discovering their origin. \n\nI hoped that in my travels through the citadel, I would find a colossal lucent or a nexus of magical energy which solidifies into the now familiar sight of the lucents. These would provide obvious and indisputable evidence to support my theory. Unfortunately, my esoteric endeavors rarely lead to obvious and indisputable conclusions.\n\nWhat I can confirm is that there is a higher than usual collection of lucent crystals in the citadel. They range in size and shape, but almost all of them are not storing the quantities of energy seen in the lucents of Fargrave. Perhaps there is something within the citadel which attracts the lucents. Whatever it is, it could have a way to attract the crystals here instead of forming the crystals.\n\nIf this new theory is correct, then the crystals have some as of yet unknown origin. In a way, this means my theories have thus far been incorrect. But, in searching them out, I may have discovered something new about the lucent crystals that my colleagues do not know. I will have to stay here to study them further.

{{21337012-0-8189:}}by Ulfsild \n\nA short guide, written on my final day in the Scholarium. An encapsulation of years of work, for you.\n\nSelect the Grimoire you wish to make your own.\n\n- The Grimoires I've left behind cover a wide array of scenarios and magical applications. I hope you find one to your liking.\n\n- Think of each Grimoire as a framework. They are pure opportunity, ready for you to adapt to your needs.\n\n- In time, perhaps, others will learn from my techniques and other Grimoires might be created. I smile to think of my work living on.\n\nDefine the Focus of your Scribing by choosing one of those scripts.\n\n- I call them "Focus" Scripts because they define what a Scribed Skill truly is. Fire or frost? Heal or harm? What will your scribing do?\n\n- I've always associated the Focus Scripts with the Gryphon. So directed, so sure of himself in his actions.\n\nEvery skill must have a Signature element.\n\n- "Signature" seemed the perfect word for these elements, as these magical components make your Scribed works memorable. I've discovered so many ways to allow Scribing to interact with the goals and magics of other disciplines, other schools of thought.\n\n- I collaborated with the Dragon heavily on these works, her keen mind the perfect sounding board for these complicated ideas.\n\n- It was, indeed, the Dragon's idea to concept out Scripts that might adapt to the fighting and magical styles of a person holding the parchment. We were never able to fully develop this Script in my time. But perhaps, one day.\n\nFinalize the skill by applying Affix benefit of your choosing.\n\n- Every time I Scribed a new spell, I found that there was this leftover space in the structure.These simple mystical additions were suggested by the Netch, a way to add a little something to fill that empty spot.\n\n- Affixes are a way for you to nudge your work in a direction that best suites you or your allies. So many directions you might take them.\n\nUse Luminous Ink to craft your newly Scribed Skill. \n\n- Created in collaboration with the Netch, the ink I use in Scribing is merely a substrate to the power vested through the altar. It's meant as a kind of binding agent, a way to draw raw magicka, thought, and intent together upon the page.\n\nOther Notes:\n\n- Once you've Scribed a skill or spell, you can always try Scribing anew from your existing Grimoire. Endless variation has always been part of my intent. Provided you have the ink, of course.\n\n- Not every Script will apply to every grimoire, but this is a wonderful place to play, experiment, and discover. To me, that's part of the true magic of Scribing.\n\nIf you'll excuse some tired humor: all you have to do is build a locus of power, convince creatures of pure magic that you mean well, pour their power into Grimoires (which you have to design) and develop luminous ink you'll need to complete your creation! Easy!\n\nI hope that all the work I've put into Scribing is not lost to time. Good luck, whoever follows in my footsteps. And may the Crow be your guide.

{{21337012-0-7779:}}A Connoisseur's Guide to the Vintages of West Weald and the Colovian Highlands, by Orius Hertano\n\nIf the Imperials of Cyrodiil love one thing, it is their wine. And the best wine comes from the Colovian Highlands region of West Weald. Blessed with a wide variety of environments suitable for viticulture, the region is famous for its long, warm summers, its rainy, reliable winters, and its rich, loamy, mildly acidic soil. As a result, the region produces superior and bountiful harvests of the jazby, surilie, pinot, and allegran grape varietals. \n\nMost of the excellent wine of West Weald takes the form of robust reds, but flavorful white wines succeed as well in this region, particularly in the western sections of the Highlands, near the Gold Coast. This region is renowned for its highly regarded muscats, which have strong floral and fruity notes.\n\nThe vineyards of the Battlehorn region, in the Highlands close to the Hammerfell border, produce some of the finest hearty reds to found in Cyrodiil. Boisterous and full-bodied, the practice of aging wine in oak barrels provides subtle flavors to the finished product that has been served at the tables of numerous noble households for generations. The extensive vineyards that grow of the Battlehorn region have welcomed workers from across the Empire to help raise and harvest their spectacular grapes. \n\nThe vineyards around Skingrad, while not part of the Highlands proper, are responsible for some of the best of West Weald's vintages. A wide variety of Imperial citizens have settled in the region, and immigrants from Redguard, Skyrim, and even Black Marsh have established operations here, adding their own techniques and recipes to mix. The Skingrad wines benefit from the introduction of lavender, lotus, cornberries, and ginger to their vineyards, adding new dimensions to the grapes grown there.\n\nWhile most of the wineries produce exceptional if traditional reds and whites, House Valente includes a sparkling red among their offerings. They use a second fermentation process to produce a lighter, more festive wine that is perfect to start a meal or to serve with dessert. This extremely popular offering attracts merchants from even the most distant locations in Tamriel.\n\nFinally, we should address the Weald Wallop that has made the region famous among wine lovers everywhere. Wallop is a blended wine made of less successful harvests and small, marginal vintages. It is notable for its high sugar and alcohol content, hence its name. Other wine-producing regions have their own versions, but few can compare to even the least successful harvest from West Weald. It makes an excellent table wine and is often served mulled, as a port, or distilled into a very passable brandy.

Still, she pretty much jumped for joy when the petals grew under my hands. Here, wait, I'll break down what happened for you. \n\nMy biggest struggle, according to Belathel, is that I couldn't focus on the Green when it was talking. Which is understandable now that I've heard it. The Green doesn't talk like anything I've ever heard before. Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nBelathel tried something different during our lesson today. Instead of manipulating the Green herself and having me listen for its words, today she put her hands over my ears. I don't know how she did this but she either dampened the noise of the rest of the world or she amplified the Green's voice. But I could hear it. It was old, and more opinionated than you'd think plants would be. It told me where to nudge, showed me how to fill the sprout with energy, and let me feel the song of growth. As I funneled my magicka into the sprout, I could hear it too, a much younger voice blending with the Green's.\n\nI can't believe that after all this time, I'm finally on my way to becoming a Greenspeaker! Belathel thinks I'll make quick work of the more advanced lessons now that I can hear the Green. Tomorrow we'll start turning my flower into a table. I have no idea how that will work, but I can't wait to get started!\n\nGive all my love to the rest of the family. And please ask mum to send some of her honey cakes. I want to give them to Belathel as thanks for her patience.\n\n\nWith love and affection, \nNothelas
{{21337012-0-7781:}}By Viola Fulcinius, Professional Hunter\n\nI first discovered my love for hunting in my own backyard, so to speak. I grew up in the Colovian Highlands, and the grasslands of the Imperial Reserve were a mere half-day's walk from my father's house. From the time I was old enough to string a bow, I used to slip away to roam the Reserve and try my luck. Deer, antelope, pheasant, and the occasional West Weald boar abounded in the finest hunting ground between Cyrodiil and the Gold Coast.\n\nGiven the abundant game, I came to appreciate why the old emperors kept the place for themselves. My father told me that Emperor Brazollus Dor used to love hunting in these lands. In fact, he loved it a lot more than sitting on the Ruby Throne and trying to run the empire, so he told his potentate to deal with business in Cyrodiil while he built himself a villa near Weatherleah. His only official act was to declare a vast swath of the plains his own personal game reserve.\n\nFor a century or so, no one but the occasional poacher dared to take the Emperor's deer. But the Potentates who followed the Reman Emperors weren't interested in paying to guard herds they never personally hunted. The Imperial Reserve gradually became just a name on a map in the White-Gold Tower. Soon, the ordinary people of Colovia, including my father, and myself, quietly resumed hunting in the area. And why not?\n\nI've hunted all over Tamriel. I've tracked mammoths in Skyrim, speared nix-oxen in Morrowind, and skinned wamasu in Black Marsh. But I come back to the Imperial Reserve in Colovia at least once a year for the simple pleasure of a good, clean hunt in the land where I was born. Especially in the fall, when the air is crisp and the bucks are in the rut.\n\nI'll see you on the hunt!

{{21337012-0-7789:}}By Valenca Arvina, Historian-in-Residence at Gwylim University\n\nThe end of the Alessian Empire is a challenging topic for any historian. It has been written that the Alessian Empire fell because the theocracy of the Alessian Order grew too large to sustain. While accurate enough, it tells us little about what happened and why.\n\nThe immediate cause of the Empire's collapse was the inability to maintain control over distant provinces; specifically, High Rock. High Rock's merchants were dissatisfied with the heavy taxation and regulation imposed by the Empire, and the Order's hostility toward people "tainted" by Altmer heritage certainly did not help. As the twenty-fourth century of the First Era opened, the kingdoms of High Rock withdrew from the Empire.\n\nThe Order's theocrats sorely resented their loss of influence over the Breton lands. However, the Order refrained from sending a military response. The Prelate Council in Cyrodiil feared the costs of invading a hostile High Rock and trying to occupy it indefinitely. At best, they would spend vast sums to garrison the province. At worst, they might fail. They decided to bide their time. But in 1E 2319, King Desynan of Skingrad arranged a marriage between his son and the daughter of Queen Margert Gardner of Wayrest.\n\nThe threat of a dynastic alliance between the Colovian Estates and High Rock was too dangerous to ignore. Arch-Prelate Zirnius used his religious authority to forbid the match. Infuriated by his interference, King Desynan appointed a "High Prelate of Colovia" to approve the marriage. Zirnius, in turn, denounced King Desynan and all prelates who denied the Arch-Prelate's authority as heretics, and sent legions whose loyalty he trusted against the Colovian Estates.\n\nThe war that ensued is best described as a period of anarchy, local uprisings, and shifting alliances. It certainly involved very little righteousness on any side. Cyrodiil's initial effort to subdue the Colovian Estates foundered in the face of stiff resistance, but the Colovians in turn had difficulty uniting to pursue a campaign against the eastern empire. The main theater of the fighting soon shifted northwest to Iliac Bay, where Alessian legions scoured the Breton lands defying Imperial authority.\n\nThe costly fighting in the west forced Arch-Prelate Zirnius to strip the Imperial east for taxes and troop levies. This alienated the Nibenese merchants and nobles who had formerly supported the Order at the very time the Order's legions were busy elsewhere. One by one, the cities of the east came under the control of local lords who resented the demands the Order continued to place upon them.\n\nThe end came when the great monastery at Lake Canalus was razed by Nibenese rebels and Arch-Prelate Zirnius was killed. Left without command or pay, the Alessian legions fighting in High Rock abandoned their mission. Many legionnaires returned to their homelands. Others permanently settled the territory they already held, while a few turned to brigandage. In 1E 2331, King Desynan arranged for a puppet emperor to take the Ruby Throne and the War of Righteousness officially ended.\n\nThat, of course, was not the end of the strife. Pockets of fighting continued in outlying provinces, and most of the Imperial heartland remained under the control of local warlords. The disorders of the War of Righteousness continued for generations afterward.
{{21337012-0-8149:}}From the travelogue of the esteemed Chronicler Firandil of the Mages Guild.\n\nWe arrived at the outskirts of the Ayleid ruin just before dark. I wanted to delve inside and begin our work, but as a more junior member of the team, my recommendation was ignored. Thus, I found myself pitching tents and crafting makeshift stalls to transform our rag-tag caravan into a camp worthy of our mission. \n\nIt was a great honor to be chosen for this endeavor. Not many are asked to join the senior members of the guild in exploring the remnants of the famed Heartland Elves! I spent many nights pouring over texts and recounts of previous expeditions in preparation. Waiting until daylight seemed almost torturous. It should surprise no one that instead of getting a well-deserved rest, as Wizard Tloglai suggested, I snuck into the darkness on my own.\n\nArmed with magelight, some notebooks, and a water skin I made my way deep into the recesses of the ruin. I don't know how long I wandered. Time seemed inconsequential in those off-white halls. Before I knew it, dawn broke over the crests and arches of the Ayleid structures. \n\nMy absence at camp must have raised some sort of alarm, as I heard voices calling my name and searching through the site quite loudly. Wizard Tloglai was concerned, possibly even worried for my safety, but I knew I could not allow myself to be discovered without anything to show by way of explanation. So, I continued away from the sounds of my fellow mages. Which is when it happened. \n\nSome oddity caught my eye. When I turned to look at what it was, I saw nothing but a wall. There was nothing to suggest that this collection of stones and mortar was any different than the others in the ruins.\n\nThat's where they found me, staring at a wall with immense concentration. I'm not sure how Wizard Tloglai identified what caught my attention. Instead of giving me a rather large speech about safety and staying in the camp at night, she chose to press on one of the stones. It shifted beneath her hand and revealed a stairwell into the unplundered depths of the ruin. \n\nI did not know it then, but this would not be the first time that such an odd occurrence would happen to me. It may have been the beginning of my incredible position as a chronicler. Through my ability to discover what others cannot, I carved out a path of success within the Mages Guild for myself.
{{21337012-0-8148:}}My little library feels like it's taken on a life of its own. Some days it feels like I find new books around every corner, new secrets waiting to be uncovered, in tomes I'm sure I didn't bring down here.\n\nThe other day as I stood among the shelves, head down in some fascinating tome or other, I felt a sharp tug on the back of my shirt. I turned around, expecting the Fox (of course), but no one was there. In any other circumstance, it would have been eerie. But for some reason, I felt lighter. As if whatever strange force had pulled me from my book simply wanted me to look up in wonder for a moment.\n\nI paced the shelves for a few minutes, peering around corners and tiptoeing past the stacks of books I had set aside. Perhaps it was a bit silly, but I saw no sign of the ghostly force. \n\nI returned to my reading, only to have the same thing happen twice more. It began to feel like a game, as if the moment I fully lost myself within my book, the invisible force would do anything it could to get my attention. I've decided the next time it happens, I'm going to act as if I don't notice it at all. I wonder what it will do if it feels it's being ignored?\n\n* * *\nToday I returned to that particular corner of the Scholarium. I found my books had been rearranged into the shape of a massive squirrel. After sorting out my reading materials and doing a cursory check of the nearby shelves, I settled in and waited to see if my invisible playmate would return. \n\nAfter a few minutes, it did—even more eagerly than yesterday. As much as I wanted to turn around at the insistent tugging on my clothes, I held firm to my plan and ignored it. I think this may have thrown off the creature, as it was quiet for a few minutes after that.\n\nJust when I started to think I had perhaps offended the being, my book leapt out of my hands, seemingly by its own volition, and hovered in the air in front of me. The sudden surprise of this childish retort brought a smile to my face—how could it not? I laughed as a game of keep-away ensued, with my invisible playmate pulling the book just out of my reach every time.\n\nI found myself being led down hallway after hallway, my hovering book eagerly marking the way down the passages. I came at last to one of the distant studies, a room which we'd had built but I hadn't yet stocked. An air of power emanated from all around me. Less somber than the Indrik, less serious than the Gryphon. It almost reminded me of entering a child's room or even an artist's studio, a place of creativity and joy.\n\nI passed through the doorway and found myself … somewhere else! A seaside domain bathed in sunlight. Though I waded through shallow water, my feet stayed perfectly dry, a considerate touch of the magic.\n\nBasking in the warm sunshine was a large, glowing Netch. It bobbed happily in the sea breeze, and as I approached it reached out its tentacles as if to embrace me. Somehow, I knew the Netch meant me no harm—quite the opposite.\n\nThe many tendrils began to delicately wrap themselves around my body, embracing me, taking the measure of me. "Hello, there," I said at last.\n\nAs I spoke, the Netch loosened its tentacles, until there was only one left draped over my shoulder. "You are quite buoyant, aren't you?" the Netch said.\n\n"Thank you?" I replied.\n\n"How is your spirit so bright? Your vessel is so un-netch-like?"\n\n"It's this place. It's full of magic and wonder. How could I not be happy here?" I said.\n\nAt this, the Netch seemed to float a little higher. "Oh, I like you! We shall play such fun games, not-Netch!"\n\nI smiled. "My name is Ulfsild."\n\n"Ulf-sillld," the Netch contemplated my name. "I rather think we shall have fun together, Ulfsild. What do you say?"\n\nI paused, but only for a moment. "I say, what do you want to play?
{{21337012-0-7782:}}By Valenca Arvina, Historian-in-Residence at Gwylim University\n\nMuch has been written about the great kings of the Reman dynasty. But between Reman I, Reman II, and Reman III, the Second Empire endured the reigns of less illustrious leaders. For example, Emperor Brazollus Dor. Famously uninterested in affairs of state, Brazollus Dor nonetheless held the throne for thirty-four years.\n\nBrazollus Dor's unreadiness for the throne began with the circumstances of his birth. He was the illegitimate son of Reman II and a common-born maid named Irinia Dor, who caught the eye of the newly crowned Emperor when he was visiting Skingrad. Although Reman II was fond of Irinia, he had to seek a marriage more suitable for the Ruby Throne. He soon left Irinia with a child and set up a comfortable estate to provide for them both.\n\nA powerful, handsome youth, Brazollus strongly resembled his illustrious forebear Reman I, but he had little of the great man's ambition or intuition. Since it was expected that Reman II would soon enough produce a legitimate heir, Brazollus settled into the life of a Colovian lordling, not an Imperial scion. He spent his days looking after his vineyard, hunting, and entertaining friends.\n\nThen, in 1E 2843, the Ruby Throne fell to Brazollus when Reman II was slain in battle. With a heavy heart, the young man assumed the throne as Emperor Brazollus Dor, choosing to keep his mother's name. For a time, he did his best to meet his new responsibilities in Cyrodiil. He even resumed his father's campaign in Morrowind, fighting valiantly enough. But the White-Gold Tower weighed him down with administrative and diplomatic duties he was ill-suited to deal with.\n\nUnhappy in Cyrodiil, Brazollus soon retreated to the Colovian countryside he loved, spending more and more time away from the capital. He delegated everything he could to his potentate, Sidri-Ashak, while he instead busied himself with the construction of Villa Doria, a palatial estate in the hills west of Skingrad. Brazollus returned to the White-Gold Tower less and less frequently, until soon enough he stopped bothering to go back at all.\n\nFor the last twenty years of Emperor Brazollus's reign, the Villa Doria served as the Imperial court, although little official business was actually conducted there. Instead, it was a place of entertainment and diversions. The Emperor spent his time in games and revels (many of which turned into debauched orgies, to be perfectly honest), while Potentate Sidri-Ashak quietly administered the empire.\n\nBrazollus Dor died suddenly in 1E 2877, still hale and hearty in his sixty-second year. Some suspected foul play. It was rumored that factions unhappy with Sidri-Ashak's growing power decided to neutralize the potentate by bringing a vigorous new emperor to the throne. Reman III was only fourteen, but he quickly moved to return the Imperial court to Cyrodiil and exercise power in his own name. Brazollus Dor's beloved Villa Doria was all but abandoned and later fell into ruin under the Akaviri Potentates.\n\nWhat is the historian to make of Brazollus Dor? Few emperors accomplished less, yet the empire flourished during his reign. Alas, the same cannot be said of many of his more capable peers.
{{21337012-0-7783:}}By Beragon of Valenwood, Imperial Scribe\n\nAeradan Camoran may be king of Valenwood, but most Wood Elves see him as a distant figure. Instead, they look to the Treethane of their home city or community for leadership. It may surprise some readers to learn that Treethanes often come from families nearly as highborn as the Camorans of Elden Root. House Rayn of Silvenar is an excellent example.\n\nAn old and honorable clan, the Rayns came to power in Silvenar at the end of the First Era, when Emperor Reman chose to administer the conquered Valenwood through its independent kingdoms rather than as a single province. Rayn Treethanes swore allegiance to the Emperor of Cyrodiil (grudgingly in some cases), and in turn were free to rule Silvenar as their own realm. The arrangement continued under the Akaviri Potentates. During their reign, five of seven Treethanes in Silvenar came from House Rayn.\n\nWhen the last potentate died in 2E 430, the rulers of Silvenar were obvious contenders for the throne of a reunited Wood Elf kingdom in Valenwood. Alas, it was not to be. House Rayn looked inward, seeking to forge a coalition of clans who held to traditional Wood Elf values. The Camorans of Elden Root looked outward instead. Growing rich from trade and forging alliances with realms beyond Valenwood, the kings of Elden Root reclaimed their pre-Reman place as the leading power among the Wood Elves. By the time of the Blacksap Rebellion in 2E 489, Silvenar's Treethane, Ubarion Rayn, had no choice but to support King Aeradan rather than his less tolerant cousin, Gelthior.\n\nNot all Treethanes in Silvenar are Rayns, of course. The choosing of a Treethane is one part public acclaim, one part designation by the preceding Treethane, and several parts deal-making between a city's influential clans. Treethane Thalrinel, the current leader in Silvenar, isn't a Rayn. But a Rayn named Nantharion rules as king over the new settlement of Vashabar, north of the Strid. And it's certainly true that, when the time comes for a new Treethane to be chosen in Silvenar, one Rayn or another will be in contention.\n\nOh, and one final note for my Imperial readers. No, the Silvenar isn't the ruler of Silvenar. The role of the Wood Elf who holds the title Silvenar is a whole other topic for discussion!

{{21337012-0-8152:}}Nahlia asked that Julian and I should add to the records of the Scholarium. I'm not sure if Julian is working on her addition in secret, but I assume that's the case. There are so many books here, I'm almost not sure what to write. Can I even make a poor choice of topic? Archmage Ulfsild included all sorts of books in her library so I can't really do anything to disrespect or tarnish her collection. Which is comforting. Well, I suppose this is it then. \n\nThe writings of Votary Llaren, Knight of the Lamp.\n\nI'm not sure that life ever turns out the way we expect it to. Younger iterations of myself dreamed of battles and skirmishes, racing between foliage to outmaneuver my enemies. I thought that adventure was always exciting cave-delving and revelations. \n\nSometimes it is, and those moments are thrilling. But adventure and battle are more complex than I'd ever given them credit for as a youngster. Many of my compatriots would never appreciate the work I do with the order now. They wanted a certain type of adventure and became soldiers. Luckily for me, the Order of the Lamp thought I had the qualifications to be a knight.\n\nAs I sit here with quill in hand, I find I can't quite believe all that I've done. All that I've seen. I thought I would just be a bodyguard for the mages. Protect them from trolls and minotaurs while they did something serious and bookish. But that hasn't been my life at all. \n\nWell, to be fair, I have fought off trolls.\n\nBut I've found, much to my delight, I do not fight alone. Almost all of the mages I'm sent to protect know how to defend themselves. Sometimes (like now) I get to pair up with another votary in the order.\n\nI've battled furious Dremora on cliff faces, defeated raging atronachs in the depths of mountains, and cut through armies of the undead to stop necromancers from sweeping across whole territories. I'm not so idealistic to say that those battles were easy affairs. Mages make a lot of noise and cause a lot of distractions. It's never easy to use my own weapons in the chaos of a magical battle. I suppose that's why the order is so particular about who they recruit; not every fighter can perform in those circumstances. \n\nBut now I find myself here in a hidden library. I suppose I expected more danger, but I'm not going to complain about a slower assignment. There's enough to explore and learn that my days aren't spent idly waiting for another assignment. So no, life is not as I expected it and that's wonderful. It's real. \n\nWell. For now I think that's about all I can say on the matter. Nahlia, I hope this is a good addition to the collection.

First, the Battle at Red Mountain, followed by the Dwemer's disappearance, and now the sudden physical change in the Chimer. \n\nNaturally, exaggerated writings about this meant solely for a quick grab of gold alone have already circulated across Cyrodiil. "Their change signals the end times!" "Stare into their eyes and you will fall into Oblivion itself!" \n\nSome of this fodder will be claimed as facts and taught to the young minds of tomorrow. Thus, as a scholar, I believed it was my duty to document what I've seen of these so-called Dark Elves first hand. Their skin is ashen and their eyes pools of red like lava. I see now why some are calling it a curse from Red Mountain. But who they were, their nature, remains unchanged. So, tell me, does their change in appearance really deserve this much hysteria?\n\nDunmer or Chimer, they continue to live their lives, still a people with a proud tradition. And no doubt, a bright and unmarred future. This I know for a fact, dear reader.
{{21337012-0-8150:}}From the travelogue of the esteemed Chronicler Firandil of the Mages Guild.\n\nI did it! I accomplished what no other mage has been able to. I convinced the priest of the temple to allow our detachment to study the Jewel of the Sphinx. \n\nJust think, when this endeavor began I was merely tasked with ensuring that we had enticing wares and enough rations to make the trip comfortably. While this is not the most exciting of roles a mage can undertake, it was critical for the success of this mission.\n\nBut, as I set up my stocks and stalls, I overheard one of the warlocks pleading with a priest to be able to study one of their famed relics. The priest, distrustful, declined every proposition Warlock Ulelfanya made. After several minutes, it seemed as though the discussion would turn into an argument—dashing all possibilities for this crucial element of our trip to be fulfilled. That was when I made my presence known. \n\nHumbly, I spoke to Priest Sazarali about my successes in finding the secret at the Aylied ruin, my discovery at the guild hall in Solitude, my surprising tumble into treasure at the archmagister's summer home. And, in a fit of diplomatic brilliance, I offered to look over the entirety of the temple, if she would allow my fellow mages to study Khenarthi's prized jewel. \n\nPriest Sazarali agreed! For as long as I search for ancient secrets in the temple Warlock Ulelfanya and the other mages will be able to study the jewel. Even without a single discovery this is a great coup in relations between the priests and the guild. And, of course, another feather in the cap for your esteemed chronicler!\n\nI will set off in the morning to explore as much of the temple as I can. There may be more I need to add to my travelogues before the fortnight is out!

My search for a remedy has seen me plagued by my own skin. This truly is a divine punishment inflicted on all Dunmer. I imagine the Dwemer must be having quite the laugh, wherever they wound up.\n\nRed Mountain held nothing but fragments of bone. I was breathing in the dust of those who fell in battle. My hope was to discover some leftover Dwarven secret or perhaps an artifact of my ancestors. Anything that might aid me. Hope built on baseless rumor. Gossip between soldiers. \n\nPerhaps anything that might have helped disappeared along with the Dwemer. I don't know, nor do I care. My faults and insecurities got the best of me.

{{21337012-0-8125:}}Galtus, \n\nI'm doing you a good turn. I can see that you missed some late-night chatter, so I'm going to fill you in on some things. You probably know that our band of hunters are paid well. That's because of Jerntann's plans. We're here to help people get rid of the creatures that pose a threat to them. Sometimes, like this job, we help commonfolk see that they're in danger first. \n\nWhat you need to do is listen to Jerntann, do whatever job you need to, and not question him. That's it. The only thing standing between you and our coin is your ability to trust Jerntann. Jerntann wanted to run you out of camp after your outburst, but I told him that you need to take the night to think it over. Maybe tomorrow you'll be able to do your job and kill the Goblins when they come to camp.\n\nIf you still don't think this is right, then you'd better leave before morning. Goblins are dangerous after all, and I'd hate to find your corpse after this job is over.\n\nGaea Lauzzon
{{21337012-0-8124:}}My Dearest Sister,\n\nTell mother not to worry about my supper tonight. I won't be returning home anytime soon. As you know, the count's boar hunt was this morning, and I must regretfully tell you that although the hunt is over, I'm in no shape to travel.\n\nThat said, I can still hold a quill, so I suppose I owe you the whole story.\n\nAt dawn, I set out for the forests south of the Weatherleah Estate to meet the rest of the hunting party. The count is quite generous to sponsor a hunt for the public, so I was far from the only hopeful hunter in group. In fact, there were so many of us that I thought we were more likely to chase off any game than come across something worth pursuing.\n\nCount Calantius is wise though, so his aides quickly divided the massive group into several smaller parties that were told to fan out away from each other. To my shock, I realized I had somehow ended up in a group with the count himself! I couldn't see him very well, as he allowed the hunters on foot to lead the way, while he gallantly rode behind on a white steed with golden armor. I wanted to hang back for a better view, but that wouldn't have gotten me any closer to nabbing a boar.\n\nInstead, I gripped my spear tightly and moved toward the front of the group on light feet. The count's hounds trotted ahead, noses to the ground as they searched for the scent of boars. It was quiet for some time. The only sounds were the snuffling dogs and the hunters' careful steps.\n\nAll at once, the dogs threw their heads back and started baying as they picked up the scent. Those of us on foot began running after the hounds, bounding recklessly through the underbrush as we neared our quarry. \n\n"There!" someone shouted. The party broke into an open glade, where we discovered two massive boars locked in a deadly territorial skirmish. The size of their tusks gave them away as males, and their bristling fur betrayed the animal fury within. The intensity of their battle must have masked the approach of our party. It was stunning.\n\nWithout warning, the larger of the boars broke away from the other and charged toward the hunters at the front of the party. The whole group of us surged toward the action. A brave man with a long hunting sword attempted to plunge it into the beast's neck. \n\nIt was the last mistake he would ever make. \n\nThe boar's frenzied momentum carried it easily up the length of the man's sword, until the blade was buried in the animal's hide and the boar's tusks had gored the man deep in his belly. Blood poured out from the wound, and the man lost his grip on the sword embedded in the animal's flank as it searched out a new target. The man fell quickly, his body forgotten in the chaos of the moment. \n\nAs the boar began to snort and circle before making another charge, I had a sickening realization. We'd lost track of the second boar. \n\nThe whole party was engaged with the larger animal, intent on avenging the fallen hunter. I turned back to see if the count would choose this moment to strike, when I saw the unmistakable shape of the second boar goring through the count's aides and knights, making for his horse. Without thinking, I turned away from the first boar and began running toward the count. \n\nTo his credit, the count saw the boar coming, and grim acceptance crossed his face as he raised his sword for what he knew would be a futile blow. Before the beast made contact with the count and his steed, I drew back my arm and launched my spear directly at the count. \n\nIt was a risky move, to be sure. I've never been a great shot, and I could certainly use more practice on moving targets. Arkay must have guided my hand, because the spear flew true. It pierced the second boar through its eye, killing the beast not a moment before it would've had Count Calantius on the end of its tusks.\n\nThe count stared at the dead boar for a moment before lifting his gaze to meet mine. He nodded at me and I'm sure was about to say something profound before the first boar charged me from behind.\n\nI don't remember much after that. Thankfully the boar's tusks missed me, but the beast did trample me on its way through the crowd before someone eventually put it down. I awoke hours later in the count's castle in Skingrad, where healers had set my leg and given me a soothing drink for my scrapes and bruises. \n\nThe count was especially grateful for my intervention with the boar. He even invited me to sit at the high table with him at the feast that night! I never could've imagined sitting with the count himself as we dined on roast boar and toasted the many brave hunters of West Weald. \n\nCount Calantius arranged for me to stay here in Skingrad until I'm well enough to travel home. He's offered me a horse from his personal stable, as well as a year's supply of salted pork and a monetary prize—for taking down a boar plus more for saving his life. \n\nI will write again soon to let you know of my recovery. We'll have plenty of time to discuss how to spend the prize money when I return, although I can safely say I'm retired from boar hunting!\n\nYour loving brother,\nAlbanus Caudex

{{21337012-0-8134:}}By Beragon, Imperial Scribe\n\nIn this year 556 of the Second Era, I have been commissioned by Emperor Moricar to document an itinerary for travelers wishing to visit the Imperial west: Old Colovia, the Gold Road, and West Weald. This is a welcome assignment for me. I have resided in Skingrad since my adventuring days, and these are lands I have come to know well.\n\nYour tour of the Imperial west begins in Skingrad, the largest city of the Imperial west. The "Gem of Old Colovia" is a bustling center of commerce, protected by high walls and strong gates. Behind its defenses, Skingrad reveals itself as a city of quaint alleyways, clean stone courts, and the fine townhouses of noble families. The crown jewel of the city is the Great Chapel of Julianos, a mighty temple dedicated to the God of Wisdom.\n\nFrom Chapel Square, head southwest through the center of town. You will find an excellent inn, the Fertile Respite, at the city's Wayshrine Square. Continue to Skingrad's western district, passing by the Traders Court where itinerant merchants from all over Tamriel come to sell their wares. As you make your way to the Gold Gate, pause to admire the lovely statue of Kynareth that stands in front of the Fighters Guild hall. The people of Skingrad are well known for their pious inclinations.\n\nSkingrad is merely the beginning of our journey through the Imperial west. Here is the midpoint of the famous Gold Road, a vital link to Anvil and the sea-trade of the Gold Coast. The road follows the vale of the Strid River westward, passing through a pleasant land of vineyards, orchards, woodlands, and charming towns such as Ostumir.\n\nWhile you could easily follow the Gold Road all the way to Anvil, that is the subject of a different travelogue. West of Ostumir, you should come to a path leading up into the hills. Follow it northward, past lonely homesteads such as Shardrock and the mysterious Ayleid ruins of Ceyond. Be careful about leaving the path in this area; the woods are home to the great black bears of West Weald.\n\nHigh above the mighty fortress of Feldagard Keep, the path from Ostumir meets the ancient Highlands Road. Turn left to follow the old road into the western portion of the Colovian Highlands. In Hastrel Hollow, you will find the picturesque ruins of an old First Empire watchtower. Farther west, the road brings you to the quaint town of Sutch and the nearby Ayleid ruin of Niryastare. I have some personal experience with the dangers of this site, so I urge you to admire the place from a safe distance and then return the way you came.\n\nFollowing the road east, you soon come to the heart of Old Colovia, the Colovian Highlands. Here stands the trade-town of Leftwheal at the head of the Brena River. Most trade between Hammerfell and Cyrodill goes by sea via the Gold Coast, but the old overland routes from Rihad to Leftwheal remain important. From Leftwheal, the Highlands Road wends its way through the hills to the prosperous town of Ontus. Many Redguard settlers now make their home in this area, providing the Imperial west with a small taste of life in Hammerfell.\n\nIn Ontus, turn southeast. Your route now descends through the verdant hills and plains of the Imperial Reserve, former hunting ground of the Reman emperors. While these lands were once for the use of the emperors alone, all are free to hunt here now. Weatherleah Estate stands along the northern margin of the area, an outstanding example of a Colovian noble's manor. Continue east, and you come to a trail leading north. Here, a brief detour takes you to the striking ruins of Elenglynn, another remnant of the long-dead Ayleids who once ruled over these lands. Be careful not to stray too far into the wilds south of Elenglynn; these hills and dells are home to hostile Goblin tribes.\n\nThe final leg of your circuit returns you to Skingrad from the north. Like the Gold Road, the Highlands Road passes through a wide and prosperous belt of vineyards, farms, and country manors as you draw near to the city. Enter Skingrad through its north-facing Chapel Gate. Your travels through West Weald conclude at the foot of the Great Chapel of Julianos, where you began.\n\nFair travels to you, reader!
{{21337012-0-8135:}}A report prepared for Tribune Alea Idolus by Legionary Caepio of the tribune's cohort.\n\nA new threat has emerged in the West Weald wilderness. Soldiers from all alliances in the Three Banners War have been deserting their posts in record numbers. While many of these run as far and as fast as possible to avoid retribution from their superiors, a significant few have formed into a mercenary band that calls itself the Dark Company.\n\nI've found evidence of these mercenaries occupying abandoned structures throughout the Weald, setting up camps from which to conduct what can only be called banditry and pillaging of nearby farms and trade caravans. Some have even found employment as hired soldiers, most notably for Lady Raxalee at the Ontus Quarry.\n\nI'm still attempting to ascertain the leadership structure of the group, which has definitely kept some semblance of military decorum for their mercenary band. It pains me to say that there are even former legionaries among their numbers, as well as soldiers who once fought for the Ebonheart Pact, the Aldmeri Dominion, and the Daggerfall Covenant. Amazing how sworn enemies have now banded together to engage in crimes against the people of West Weald.\n\nI know we're still short of the resources we need, but my opinion remains that if we don't deal with this Dark Company soon, they may grow too strong and intrenched for us to handle.

{{21337012-0-8168:}}By Necromancer Marilia Relarys\n\nInsipid fools would say that necromancy is the art of animating skeletons and binding bones together. Their lack of imagination and respect for this ancient and tragic art form is apparent from the start. True necromantic rituals require far more than dusty bones and sacked graves. The most effective necrotic conjurations are those that are fresh: ones whose beating hearts have bled out before the summoner, soaking the ground in their viscera and life force.\n\nIt is precisely this precious spillage that calls to the dead who have been long buried. Necromantic adepts must remember this, as sometimes a graveyard must be awoken, regardless of the age of the bones. In these cases, an offering should be made to the dead. A taste of that vital energy their bones no longer carry.\n\nSkeletons, after all, have their uses. More advanced constructs can even channel magicka and perform magical tasks on behalf of their master. But there is a carnal force carried in the flesh, borne on the breath, and saturated in the blood that all skeletal remains crave. The bones seek what they no longer have.\n\nWhen resurrecting more than a few skeletons, or more than the most basic constructs, followers of the dark practice should whet the appetite of long-dead bones for the living world. The taste of blood and the release of vitality is irresistible to spirits that have otherwise been dormant. Like water to a person dying of thirst, once the dead remember the taste of life, they cannot go back to sleep.\n\nSourcing the offering is another matter entirely, generally a more personal choice among practitioners. For some, the forceful taking of a life is part of the art. Stealing a life to reawaken the dead has a certain poetic beauty. Others prefer willing sacrifices, both for practical purposes and the ability to choose the precise time and place of the bloodshed. Still others hold that their own blood should be offered to the dead, but this is a fool's errand. Even the largest and most hardy necromancer cannot offer more than a few drops, and giving the deceased a taste of one's own blood is highly ill-advised. After all, the dead are thirsty. They will take what they can get.

I had, in fact, seen this sort of creature before, and the memory came back with such clarity as if it was scrawled anew from a fresh well of ink.\n\nWhen I was small, my clan-parents would send me to toddle off and collect scraps of mammoth wool where it had fallen or caught on brambles. They used it to spin a rough sort of yarn, the smell of which I'll never miss and never forget. I didn't mind the work, but I liked the excuse to wander on my own, far from wherever we took up residence and called home.\n\nOne day in late spring, I found a herd of mammoths gathered by the river, which ran cold from snowmelt in the valley. They drank deep of its waters, shedding tufts of their undercoat in the warm sunshine. This was my chance to bring home a bounty of wool for spinning, I thought. I crept through the tall grass until I was in arm's reach of a mammoth's hindquarters, then pulled fistfuls of wool from their tree-like legs, squirreling it away in my satchel like a nesting bird. It was all going perfectly, until a calf spotted me and gave a trumpeting squeak of surprise. I tried to run as the herd began to thunder, working to trample the little interloper among their herd. But I was powerless to escape.\n\nThe ground shook beneath my feet and I fell forward. Instead of hitting the dirt, my face went deep into pelt or plumage, I couldn't tell which. Thinking at first it was a trunk, I squeezed my eyes shut and held fast, hoping to be lifted or flung to safety. But as we bumped along, I realized I was on the back of something that galloped. We were on one side of the river, and in a blink and a flash of magic, we were on the other. As the creature—my savior—slowed to a canter, I shakily made to slip off its back.\n\nI only caught a glimpse of its four-legged figure as it gave a strange bark and disappeared. An antlered thing like an elk, but feathered like a bird. I ran back to my clan and told them the tale, but they just laughed at me. Silly little Ulfsild fell asleep in the woods again and had such a fanciful dream, they said. As I'd lost most of the wool from my satchel, they didn't even look twice at the fledgling feather I held curled in my hand. \n\nBut I kept it thereafter. It was made of the same currents I saw in the world, wefts of magic ever-flowing as a river, ever-changing as the clouds. I would come to wear the feather in my cap, but I would forget all about the strange antlered thing until that moment with Shalidor.\n\nI insisted we return to Sunhold, to the old scroll shop where I'd found a faded children's fable about an indrik and a hunter. Like the twists of magic I could see in the world, somehow I knew there was more to it than others could discern. Directions left in plain sight. I wandered on my own again as I did when I was a girl. I puzzled out the locations and found the wards. It couldn't be a coincidence, these fingerprints left in the world for me to follow.\n\nI knew I was an impressive mage in my own right. Word of my deeds had spread and caught the attention of Shalidor, of all people. It was one thing to walk proud in my own domain, but at the side of someone almost a millennium my senior, I felt eager to prove my worth. Not to Shalidor—he never made me feel like anything less than his equal. I would never give him such power over me. But I wanted to prove it to myself.\n\nWhen I broke the wards and trespassed into the indrik's domain, I was no longer the scared little girl about to be flattened by a herd of mammoths. But the indrik recognized me all the same. \n\nNow, Shalidor and I had made a pact never to bargain with otherworldly beings. I confess to these pages that I broke that pact when I met the Indrik. I took my cues from the fable, you see. When he asked to see a display of my power, I showed him the feather I had kept from our meeting all those years before. I offered that if he could retrieve it from me, I would give it back to him and leave his domain in peace. But if I could manage to keep it from him, he had to share his power and knowledge with me.\n\nBut you know how this tale ends. If you're reading this, you stand in the Scholarium. As I write this, the indrik's feather still stands proud in my hat. I proved my worth to myself and to the indrik without even needing to remove my cap.
{{21337012-0-8161:}}Shalidor had offered me eternal life. I said no, of course. How could he have spent a winter with me, talking so closely, and know me so little? \n\nWe argued at length about his methods. "Eternal life," I said. "All the time to travel by foot and see the world, and yet you use portals to bypass what wonders you might find along the way?"\n\n"A mortal life," he would argue back. "Your accomplishments constrained only by time, and you would spend it plodding from place to place, one foot in front of the other?"\n\nWe had agreed to disagree. I made it clear: immortality was anathema to me. I would not prolong my life any more than I would want to prolong summer to stave off winter. The beauty in seasons is always in their passing.\n\nI marveled at the idea that he could convince me of this thing, to change me in so short a time. I had never been in love before, you see. I had not yet not realized the myriad ways in which such a thing can change a person.\n\nI refused him on no uncertain terms. And that was the last I saw of Shalidor for some time.\n\nIt took several years passing before I came to terms with how I felt about that funny old man. It makes me laugh to look back and wonder how it took me so long. He was constantly on my mind! But Shalidor arguing theory with me in my head was a poor substitute for the real thing. And he conceded far too often, too easily to my superior reasoning. I needed to see him again.\n\nI thought of him in Summerset on Eyevea, that little island sanctuary he told me about. I bartered for maps of the region, the best I could find. And I taught myself portal magic. It did not come easy to me, and had I not missed him so terribly, I would never have persisted as I did. When at last I could wait no longer, I focused my magic and opened a portal to Eyevea.
{{21337012-0-8160:}}For the sake of our future children and grandchildren, I'll put these tales to paper for posterity, for I know my husband will not. Even if he wrote about such sentimental things, you know how he is. Sometimes I think his notes just grow wings and flutter off.\n\nI was a wild thing back when we met. Raised by Clever Folk who made their homes all over Skyrim. They were not the parents of my birth, but told me my mother was a Nord and my father was a Briarheart, and that I was stolen as a babe from the nest of a Hagraven. I was a wild, tempestuous, and beaky child, sharp and spiteful beyond my years. \n\nI loved to talk and play with the birds in the wood or the animals in the glen and I guarded my heart with brambles, so I never doubted this truth to this tale of my parentage. I grew steady like a reed on the riverside, the whorls of magic I could see moving across the land guiding my hand and teaching me so very much. My way of looking and speaking and acting in the world made me beloved by my clan for what I could do. Even if not for who I was.\n\nShalidor just appeared one day, quite suddenly. I rarely got a moment to myself, someone always after me for my magic. I valued my solitude. I was not happy to see it disturbed by some bewildered stranger appearing in the middle of my alchemy garden, stumbling all over my white caps and imp stools. \n\nI tore into him for his irresponsibility and scolded him for his sloppy portal magic. Opening a passageway to a place one had never been before! He seemed to get his bearings, and he argued right back that he had been here before, when the place was a broad glacier and not a swamp. And thereby not inhabited by shouting swamp-witches like me.\n\nThat gave me pause. Not the insult. The title of swamp witch rather charmed me. But the cottage where I took residence had stood there for an age or longer, shared for generations by wandering Clever Folk. I'd never known the land around it as anything but marshlands. By the state of things, it had been so for hundreds of years. I was annoyed, but the wind picked up as a blizzard roared in, so I sourly bade him into my hut for shelter.\n\nThere, I learned he had returned to Skyrim after many years abroad in search of someone called the Warrior-Witch of Kyne's Aegis. And another someone who was a Priest of Jhunal wandering the Pale. And another someone who was a Clever-Woman living in the Druadach mountains. I told him that I happened to be all three of those things, and that I was happy to add "Shouting Swamp-Witch of Hjaalmarch Hold" as of that day.
{{21337012-0-8167:}}A tale told by the sailors of Winterhold and transcribed by Kjalsdottir.\n\nLong ago in the time of our grandfathers' grandfathers, a ship came out of the north. The days were bright, for this was in Middle Yarr, when the sun rides highest in the sky. Yet the ship was covered in rime, and its frost-covered sails sagged under the weight of the ice. Winterhold's folk fell silent as the ship of ice steered slowly to the quay.\n\nA jarl named Kjalhund happened to be close at hand and hailed the newcomer. "Who are you, and from where do you come?" he called.\n\n"We are those who mourn," came the steersman's reply, "and out of death we have sailed. We beg you for fire, for salt, for bread. Will you take us in?"\n\nNow, many who stood near urged Kjalhund to turn them away, for they could see frozen corpses at the oars of the ice-ship. Yet Kjalhund saw that some still lived and he took pity on them. He called the steersman to land, and was first to board when the ship made fast. Even though the warm sun of Middle Yarr rode high in the sky, the very planks of the deck radiated a numbing cold.\n\n"What does this mean?" Kjalhund asked the ship's steersman. "What has happened?"\n\n"The Frostfall has taken Atmora," the steersman answered him. "We were the last to sail from Jylkurfyk. There will be no more after us, for the city is frozen and dead."\n\n"But the sun rides high," said Kjalhund. "It is summer!"\n\n"There is no summer in Atmora," the steersman told him. "The day we made ready to sail, a Snow Elf came to us. a child dressed in a thin gown, though we shivered in our heaviest furs. She said to us, 'I bring you a message. With your swords and axes you slew our homeland. With the Frostfall we have now slain yours. Look upon these frozen shores for the last time, and know that this is the harvest that your fathers sowed, and their fathers before them.' Then she vanished."\n\nA cold shadow fell upon Kjalhund and all who heard the steersman speak. They looked over the sea toward far Atmora, and indeed the day seemed to grow pale and chill in spite of the summer. \n\nSome in Winterhold who were not there later scoffed at the tale. If the Snow Elves commanded such dire magic, they said, then why had they not used it to defeat Ysgramor and save their realms in Skyrim? The steersman and his crew said nothing more.\n\nBut no more ships came out of Atmora.
{{21337012-0-8166:}}I've got my newest assignment from the guild. I'll be working with some higher-level adepts to explore an abandoned keep. It could get dangerous, so I was hand-picked for this mission. My portals have become invaluable to the guild over the years. It's an honor, really.\n\nExcept I have to deal with Julian.\n\nIt's not that I dislike her, necessarily. She's talented and one of the sharpest adepts I've ever seen, but she never understood why I chose to become a votary instead of continuing my arcane studies. She has little respect for the art of swordplay.\n\nOh well, duty calls, I suppose.\n\n* * *\nThe journey began typically enough. A handful of mages, with Llaren and I acting as guards. We found the keep and made our way inside. Legend says the former owner of this keep had a penchant for collecting rare tomes of magic, so the study was our final destination.\n\nWhat the legends didn't mention, however, was the owner's paranoia that someone would try to steal his precious books. Which I guess is what we came to do, but Y'ffre knows the dead can't read. As a result, the whole place was trapped from top to bottom.\n\nAt first, Julian was irritated that Llaren and I needed to clear the way for the rest of the group. She was impatient to get her hands on the books and exit that oppressive castle.\n\nWith a magical glow from her staff, she felt she had enough light to see any potential dangers ahead of her. I rolled my eyes, but let her take the lead since she wanted to so badly. We progressed through the halls for a bit, when an oddly shaped slab in the floor caught my attention.\n\nBefore I could warn her, Julian stepped on it, unaware of the trap she had just activated.\n\nJulian turned to look at me, and I knew she wasn't going to be able to dodge out of the way on her own. Without thinking, I tackled her to the floor just in time to avoid the enormous swinging blade that emerged from a hidden slot in the wall beside us.\n\nJulian's face transformed from indignity to shock as she saw how close she had come to meeting the edge of the blade.
{{21337012-0-8215:}}Thank Y'ffre for Llaren! I'm not sure I'd be alive right now if it wasn't for him.\n\nOh, wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. I should start from the beginning or this won't make sense later. I never was one for documentation, but this is important.\n\nAfter we arrived at the ruins, things were quiet for a bit. The site's located in a picturesque part of Colovia, not generally considered dangerous. Votary Llaren and I took turns patrolling the perimeter, but it felt like overkill. The Adepts were near a set of ancient doors that led into the ruins, comparing the etched runes on the doors to their own notes and writing things down. I was about to suggest to Llaren that we take a break when one of the Adepts screamed.\n\nI don't know how or why, but they opened the doors. That wasn't part of the plan, but even then, it wouldn't have been a problem, except for the angry tribe of Goblins spilling out from inside the ruins. Y'ffre's beard, I've never seen such a seething horde before. I guess I'd be angry too if a group of strangers suddenly barged into my home.\n\nThe adepts quickly began flinging spells to defend themselves, clutching their notes close to their chests as they retreated. Llaren was quicker than a wolf on the hunt, throwing himself between the adepts and the Goblins, his sword flashing as he moved. Before I realized it, I was next to him in the throng. Votary training must've really sunk in, since my body responded before my mind could catch up.\n\nWe fought like that for a while, Llaren and I seamlessly covering each other as we created a buffer zone between the Goblins and the adepts. Thankfully, there weren't too many of them, and they seemed to be moving back into the ruins somewhat. \n\nI turned to check that all the adepts were safely out of the fray. With my attention elsewhere, one enterprising Goblin took the opportunity to catch me by the ankles and knock me to the ground. \n\nRule number one of Votary training is to keep your feet on the battlefield. I was done for. Taken out on my first assignment, by a blighted Goblin, no less! \n\nThat was when I realized I'd been down long enough to have all these thoughts, and I hadn't died yet. Then I saw Llaren, his face screwed up in concentration, as he held back the pack of Goblins single-handedly. His face was bruised and bloodied. He was letting them land blows on himself to protect me on the ground!\n\nThe sight was enough to jolt me to action. I jumped to my feet, sword at the ready. But as I rose, something felt different. There was a twinge in my gut, a tingling at my fingertips. I'd felt it before, though rarely, in the classrooms of the Mages Guild. It was magic, flowing through me and demanding to be released. \n\nI didn't resist it. My hands extended and I channeled the energy outward, into the one magical element I'd ever been good at. A portal.\n\nThe other adepts didn't hesitate. The Goblins weren't backing down, so it was clear their research was over for now. They plunged into the portal that I knew would take them home. Llaren was still fighting, his breath coming in gasps now.\n\nI called out to him, and his eyebrows rose in surprise at the portal I'd summoned. But he understood. With a quick nod in my direction, he broke from the skirmish and threw himself headfirst into the portal. I followed right behind him, turning off that magical channel as I passed through. The last thing I heard was the infuriated cries of the Goblins as their quarry slipped beyond their reach.\n\n* * *\nI haven't decided how to tell my parents about this first assignment. They'll be proud that I served the guild well and protected the Adepts, but I know they wish I was the one being protected, not the protector. Still, it was incredible. Llaren thanked me for the quick exit, and even the mages seemed impressed by my skill with portals.
{{21337012-0-8217:}}To his credit, he did not seem to doubt my credentials—only his luck. Where I was known by many names, he was known only by Shalidor. He'd heard tale of my accomplishments in whatever far-flung corner of the world he'd come from. He had sought me out to bear witness to my magic.\n\nI knew of Shalidor, of course. Who didn't? What he'd said about the swamp being a glacier suddenly made sense. He was many lifetimes older than me, and yet still fool enough to land himself in my little garden! I laughed about that and eventually, over tea, it got him to crack a smile as well.\n\nAll through the storm we spoke, stopping only to top up the kettle. I interrogated him about his magic, and he mine, as we charted a map of our differences in method and practice. \n\nAll that winter, we talked and wrote and read and shared companionable silences. When I was summoned for my skills as a witch, priestess, or healer, he would follow to observe. Never butting in, helping only when I called for it. When others asked about him, I joked that he was my apprentice. He never refuted it. I think he preferred his anonymity.\n\nAnd so, he stayed. We did not share a bed then, but kept each other warm through our constant conversations. He seemed more interested all the details of my comparatively short but eventful life than expounding on all the places he'd been, the people he'd met, the things he'd seen in his many years of life. \n\nHe could have left at any time, and I'd have had plenty of cause to send him away. But I'd grown fond of him. He must have felt the same, for he didn't speak of leaving until the snow was melting with spring fast on the way. \n\nIt was then that he broke the ice, so to speak. He told me that he knew the secret to a life everlasting, and that he wanted to share it with me.
{{21337012-0-8216:}}Julian looked me right in the face, lying atop her in that dusty hallway. "Good catch," was all she said. But after that she let Llaren and I go first.\n\nWhen we finally made it to the study (two spike pits, a bear trap, and three poison darts later) the whole group was ready to get the books and be done with it.\n\nThe study was musty, covered in cobwebs and freezing. It felt like a tomb. Bookshelves lined the walls, full of ancient and arcane volumes that even I wanted to take a peek at. The far side of the room contained a wooden desk, and behind it sat a skeleton in kingly garb. The skeleton's outstretched hands rested atop an enormous leather bound tome, the jewel of this collection. No doubt the remains belonged to the former owner of the keep, still watching over his books even in death.\n\nLlaren and I quickly checked the room for traps. Finding none, we gestured for the mages to enter and take what they needed. Still, something didn't feel right. Why wouldn't the owner of the keep have some last line of defense for his personal library?\n\nI locked eyes with Julian, who was still cautiously investigating the bookshelves. We looked over to the desk, where one of the newer adepts was attempting to pry the tome out of the bony clutch of the skeleton.\n\n"Put that down, you fool!" Julian shouted.\n\nIt was too late. The skeleton sprang to life, a sinister glow emanating from its ghastly eye sockets. The adept shrieked and tried to run, but the skeleton latched onto her wrist. Before Llaren or I could react, Julian fired off a blast of magicka, rattling the skeleton's jaw and loosening its grip on the adept.\n\nShe left the book where it was and retreated to the other side of the room. "Votary, we could use a portal," Julian said to me.\n\n"But what about the books? We've come so far!" I said.\n\n"They don't matter. I want my adepts out of here, safely." Julian's eyes blazed as she sent another bolt of magic to the skeleton, who was beginning to summon a fireball in its bony fingers.\n\nI had to respect that. The portal came easily to me. The adepts retreated, some of them clutching tomes they managed to grab on the way out. Finally, it was just Llaren, Julian, and I.\n\n"Let's go," Llaren said. But Julian hesitated. I could tell she hated the idea of leaving empty-handed. I did, too.\n\n"Wait," Julian said. She looked at me.\n\n"What are you doing?" Llaren shouted as he ducked an oncoming fireball.\n\n"Just go!" I said to him. I saw that Llaren wanted to argue, but years of fighting together had built a trust between us that was hard to break. Despite his reservations, he did as I asked, leaping into the portal without a backward glance.\n\nJulian was already summoning up a spell, her face a mask of concentration. "Are you ready?" she asked.\nI nodded.\n\nWithout another word, Julian launched a massive blast of elemental energy at the skeleton, knocking it back off its feet. As she did so, I lunged forward and covered the last few feet to the desk, snatching the ancient tome before the skeleton could recover its balance. Julian was already disappearing through the portal as I turned back, and I hurled the book through first before leaping in myself and closing the portal.\n\nI came back a little singed, but I can't remember the last time such a grin cracked my face. It must've been contagious, because even Julian burst out laughing at the sight of me. Working with her might not be so bad, after all!
{{21337012-0-8210:}}What an unusual creature, the Netch! It floated by at one point through the Scholarium, stopped, and patted me upon my head with one of its tendrils. I say!\n\nIt is just as powerful as its brethren, however. The power of the Netch, now relayed through the Scribing altar, has reverberated across the land. I have it on good authority from sources in the Mages Guild that Affix Scripts have been appearing in new and unusual spots. Certainly, I've found a large trove here in the Scholarium. So you can expect more of that type to show up in my stocks. \n\nI also understand they're now showing up in caches taken from challenging scenarios in the world such as Dark Anchors or Deadlands portals. Soldiers in the Imperial City have been pulling them from their rewards, and the Undaunted have been finding them in their troves as well.\n\nWe also have reason to be believe that the Netch has caused Luminous Ink to begin seeping from harvestable crafting materials. If you were to ask me why, or how, I could spout metamagical theory at you for hours. I believe, at the end of the day, this is simply another of the Luminary's good-natured "pranks." Maddening!
{{21337012-0-8212:}}I've heard from the others the challenges you faced in constructing a riddle that met the Dragon's standards. Kudos to you, adventurer! I can assure you your efforts are resulting in tidal shifts in the magical forces across Tamriel. The imbuement of the Dragon's power has allowed me to find several new Signature Scripts during my wanderings of the Scholarium's back halls.\n\nMeanwhile, my contacts in the Mages Guild have noted Signature Scripts appearing in caches rewarded for defeating infamous powerful monsters across the land, as well as for participating in the Three Banners War in Cyrodiil. Even our oafish cohorts in the Fighters Guild apparently have seen signature scripts appear in their rewards, though how they can make heads or tails of something so masterful in mystic design is beyond me.\n\nFinally, I should alert you that Archmagister Vanus Galerion himself has taken notice of your efforts. He has subsidized a number of scripts in various styles to be made available for research purposes in guildhalls across the continent. Please see the handbill that's been passed around to our adepts for details.\n\nMost felicitous! Keep up the good work!
{{21337012-0-8211:}}Well, I never! I returned to my shop as you were in the process of completing the Gryphon's wing to find that Fox creature rooting around in my stores! Poor Caal was gibbering and snarling, quite beside herself! I shoo'd it away but when it began speaking it was so charming. Well I must say I have never dealt with quite so lovely a creature in all my days. Caal still remains skeptical, however.\n\nI digress! The most obvious result of your work with the Gryphon are the wonderful animated armor constructs that now protect the Scholarium from any potential threats. The imbuement of the Gryphons power, meanwhile, has resulted in new ley line activity across Tamriel. I've found quite a number of Focus Scripts here in the Scholarium, ready for your perusal. \n\nLikewise, my contacts in the Mages Guild were quite surprised to find Focus Scripts appearing in their reward troves. Adventurers who participate in combat against other adventurers are finding them in their "Worthy" rewards (such a term), and those who venture into delves are likewise being awarded these valuable pieces of parchment.\n\nWhat a cacophonous symphony of sources! More research awaits! Delightful!

{{21337012-0-8004:}}By Scholar Sloozgub of Skingrad\n\nThe Green Pact has long been a source of intrigue for those outside Bosmer culture. It is a mysterious covenant, binding the Wood Elves to their God of Song and Forest, Y'ffre. Through its edicts, the Bosmer have adapted and integrated into the forests where they reside, creating a mutually beneficial relationship between "the Green" and themselves. \n\nDespite its benign influences, the Green Pact has been maligned by outsiders to the culture—from bedtime tales of Wood Elves devouring unruly children, to baseless rumors of cannibalism circulated in academic spheres. After much time in the field among Wood Elf clans, this humble Orc believes she has grasped the complexities of the Green Pact. The purpose of this text is to dispel some of these salacious myths and provide the reader with facts for better understanding the Green Pact.\n\nLet us begin with the Green itself. This term refers to all living plants in Valenwood and beyond—from ancient trees to the softest moss. The Bosmer believe the Green is a gift from their primary deity, Y'ffre.\n\nAccording to Wood Elf legend, Y'ffre breathed life into them shortly after creating the Green. By taking the Green Pact, the Bosmer swore never to harm the Green in any way—in exchange, they could shape the forest to their needs. Whether or not the deity Y'ffre literally existed and bestowed such power on the Wood Elves is not the focus of this text. But it is true that their communities are grown out of living trees and the Bosmer possess an uncanny connection to the forest. They do not work with wood and their villages are never hewn from lumber. Instead, their homes are shaped from the Green itself, a living piece of the forest. \n\nAs a rule, Wood Elves do not participate in woodworking, carpentry, or whittling of any kind. It is a defilement of the Green. However, in some progressive Bosmer clans, there has been a shift toward the use of deadwood, such as branches and logs that have naturally fallen from a living plant. As these materials have already been shed by the vegetation, it cannot be harmed by their use. This is an ongoing development in the culture, and one that divides even the most progressive communities. It certainly warrants further study.\n\nAlthough Bosmer culture holds all plant life in high regard, even the most diligent Wood Elf occasionally tramples a flower or accidentally treads on new growth. It is simply to be expected when living in densely forested areas. Outside rumors suggest the penalty for such a transgression is swift and brutal punishment, often lethal. This is simply not the case. This author has observed the typical reaction is mild embarrassment from the transgressor, and gentle chiding from an elder to be more careful where they step. Only repeat offenders receive any harsher retribution, and then it is often community service to the clan and mandated meditation to reconnect with the Green.\n\nThe astute reader may have surmised that since the Bosmer have sworn not to harm the Green, they cannot use plants as food. This is true. Wood Elves patently do not farm, including the sowing, reaping, harvesting, or gathering of any fruits or vegetables. Instead, they follow the "Meat Mandate," subsisting on a diet almost entirely made up of animal products, including meat, dairy, honey, eggs, and insects.\n\nBecause of this, Wood Elves are excellent hunters. They are easily able to meet the needs of the clan with these resources and have devised clever recipes for everything from meat-based alcoholic beverages to "tarts" made of bone flour and fermented pig's milk. \n\nWhat may surprise readers is that many Wood Elves have actually consumed fruits and vegetables. While they never pick live fruit from a tree, fallen fruit is considered an acceptable meal. Similar to the deadwood issue, fallen fruit is no longer part of the living plant, so its consumption does not violate the Green Pact. (It should be noted that the use of deadwood is a more contentious issue than eating fallen fruit.) Only a small number of conservative Bosmer clans would consider this practice taboo.\n\nThis brings us to the most outlandish rumor of all: the practice of cannibalism. \n\nIt is true that in the early history of the Green Pact, ritual cannibalism was practiced. The Green Pact rejects the waste of meat, including the bodies of fallen enemies. In the past, warring clans consumed their defeated foes to ensure no meat was wasted. Though shocking, this practice was pragmatic, allowing the clan to survive and make the most of the lost lives.\n\nHowever, this custom has almost entirely fallen out of practice. This scholar has spoken to numerous Wood Elves who have no living memory of any clan participating in this ritual. However, it cannot be ruled out. It is possible that some extremely isolated or traditional clans may still hold to the practice, but in general it is a bygone edict only circulated to scare children or liven up dry lectures.\n\nAs a whole, the Green Pact is a fascinating code of conduct that uniquely binds all Wood Elves together Unless one is of Bosmeri descent or has spent an inordinate amount of time among them, outside observations can only go but so far toward understanding this phenomenon. This author hopes the reader has found something of use in this text and will use it as a starting point for further inquiries into this rich culture.
{{21337012-0-8001:}}Timestorm\n\nHistory\nNamed after a historical event of dubious truth, the Timestorm claims to wipe the memory of any who drink it. The more a person consumes, the more time is lost, or so it is claimed. The recipe originated in Elsweyr during the reign of Mane Jinninji-ri. Surviving descriptions reveal the flavor was as smooth as well-groomed fur that then blasts the moisture from your mouth like the desert sands.\n\nRecipe\nGinseng, three shavings\nMuddled Dragon's tongue, whole\nBrandy, two jiggers\nStewed cactus nettles, one handful\n\n* * *\nSage's Dream\n\nHistory\nThe name of this rare drink comes down to us from an ancient journal found within Ayleid ruins. Experts of that long-gone culture speculate that servants kept these journals instead of more educated nobles. While surprising, this makes sense when one surveys the contents. Quickly scribbled dinner requests from lords, sketched dinner table layouts, and ideas for new beverages can all be found within their pages.\n\nThe most notable recipe was for the drink named Sage's Dream by the author. The description only states "For Our Lord of Fate," though which Ayleid king or queen that refers to has been lost to time. Unfortunately, the ingredients have long gone extinct from Tamriel, which makes reproducing the drink impossible. Substitutions can be made if one wishes a distant approximation.\n\nThe journal describes the drink's taste as sharp on the tongue when it first enters the mouth, then it mellows into an intoxicating sweetness. Underneath the primary flavors rests a bitterness that rounds out the experience.\n\nRecipe\nTirum weed, one stalk\nFresh harkfruit juice, half a fruit, squeezed\nLute berries, three, no more, no less\n\nBlend under heat and pressure until tirum weed dissolves and color turns burgundy\n\n* * *\nExploding Pony\n\nHistory\nThis drink's name comes from the two-tier effect it has after consuming it. At first it evokes a gentle flavor, like brandelion tea. That lasts long enough to feel safe, and then a new flavor bursts onto the tongue. It arrives with such force that many people spit out the drink from shock. At least three people claim to have heard an audible pop. If the drink remains in the mouth, the new flavor tastes of raw honey but with a licorice tint.\n\nDue to the dual action effect of the Exploding Pony, tavern owners advise to not swallow until after the change occurs. The "explosion" will still occur in the stomach and while it's not dangerous, it can make some feel nauseous.\n\nRecipe\nLady's Smock, shredded\nNettle Anise, half cup\nSylph Gin, half cup\nCrushed bloodroot stems, at least six

{{21337012-0-8162:}}And so did Prince Hubalajad set sail from Herne with fifty-six ships to claim a realm for his own in the desert land of Hegathe. Finding the coast barren and unforgiving, he turned and sailed south and east until he came to the fertile peninsula of Khefrem's Boot.\n\nHere the prince found an excellent harbor in an empty land. As was fitting, Prince Hubalajad determined he should be first to set foot in his new home and commanded his guards to row him ashore.\n\nAlas, the prince's approach was espied by scouts of a fierce Nedic tribe, who crept close to watch from the hillside above the strand. Seeing Prince Hubalajad in all his finery standing at the bow of the boat, a disrespectful Nede loosed an arrow that struck the prince's headdress and lodged there. The prince was obliged to cast himself into the waves to escape the hail of arrows that followed.\n\nOutraged by this insult to the prince, the mighty warrior Ra Abah sprang to the shore and charged the jeering foes. Though he was gray with years, Ra Abah slew seven Nedes before any of Prince Hubalajad's other guards could join him. They drove away the barbarians with great slaughter as the prince finally waded ashore.\n\nThose standing near thought Prince Hubalajad would rebuke Ra Abah for taking the honor of being first to land. But instead, the prince embraced the old hero and thanked him for avenging his dignity. "I meant to call this place Hubalajad's Landing, but fate and valor deemed otherwise," he said. "Let it be known as Abah's Landing from this hour hence!"\n\nAnd as the prince commanded, so it was done.

Of course, father would have preferred me to stick with the adepts in their classrooms, but I've always found swords easier to understand than sorcery. \n\nI've already received my first assignment. I'll be accompanying a small group of adepts out to an Ayleid ruin tomorrow at dawn. It should be fairly uneventful. They're just studying some carved runes near the entrance to the structure. How dangerous could it be?\n\n* * *\nI guess the guild doesn't quite trust me to protect the adepts on my own just yet. There's another votary on this journey, a Dark Elf named Llaren. He's not much more experienced than I am, maybe one season ahead of my class. I suppose we're both still just saplings in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAt least he's easier to talk to than the mages in this group. Maybe it's because I used to be one of them, but I can tell they think we're unnecessary. That their magic is all they need. I know most of them could probably defend themselves if it came down to it, but magicka can be depleted. As long as I have the strength to swing my sword, I know I can depend on it.\n\nI think we're getting close.

It will be nice to take a break while the mages examine their runes or whatever it is they're up to.
{{21337012-0-8071:}}An ode to the joy of a good mystery! I asked each of the Luminaries in turn about the origins of their kind, and they all returned vastly different answers. I plan to use this to craft my impossible riddle for the Dragon. \n\nOwing to the nature of the Gryphon's birth, his answer changes each day. One day it's all magical might, the next its amount of magic expended. But his unwavering belief that he's finally got it right is always the same.\n\nThe Indrik thinks he was manifested from pure thought. An invention of a mind that craved to make sense of the world through stories. The Netch refuses to give me one answer, rotating through as many tales as it has tendrils. \n\nThe Dragon seems almost angry that I care about this as much as I do. She is perfectly content to focus on "the universe within", as she puts it. Rather than contemplating the past.\n\nHere are, in no particular order, my own theories.\n\n1. Luminaries are fallen tears of Aetherius. We have observed Aetherial energy in many different forms, mostly crystalline. Why not as spirits with physical manifestations?\n\n2. Luminaries are experimental beings made by the Aedra and placed deliberately in our plane to guide and protect us. They are to Aetherius what Daedra are to Oblivion, just much rarer.\n\n3. They're a natural part of the "magic cycle." If we imagine magic is like water, the Luminaries are like aqueducts, carrying it to our plane and casting it around them like a glowing lamp.\n\n4. The Gryphon believes it was created as an after-effect of a powerful mage's spell. Perhaps there is something to these Luminaries being made or shaped by someone in our plane. Or are they pure manifestations of thought, like the Indrik says? Feats of great magic? If someone made a Luminary, even accidentally, can it be done again?\n\nThat none of the Luminaries truly know their origin made me wonder if knowing their origin was dangerous somehow. Would comprehending the nature of their existence alter something within them?\n\nI considered this a possible strength of my riddle, then. If the Dragon could not conceive of the answer, there was no way she could guess it.\n\nSatisfied with this line of thinking, I went to the Dragon with my riddle. "What is the origin of the Luminaries?" I compelled her to seek council from her fellow Luminaries if she needed help. I did this so she could see that her answer could not possibly be the absolute truth.\n\nThis was a tremendous mistake on my part. Luminaries don't feel the passage of time the way we do. The ensuing argument lasted nearly five moon cycles. I sought Shal's advice, but he was busy in his own studies and I could tell he thought the whole ordeal was rather petty.\n\nIn the end, I could not bear to see my friends argue like that. I rescinded my riddle and asked the Dragon for another chance. After so long crafting that first riddle, I have no idea what I'm going to do.\n\nI'm taking a break from Eyevea. I'll head to Sunnamere, my quiet little sanctum near Sunhold, and think on where to go from here.

{{21337012-0-7809:}}Report from Scout Brittia Conconius to the Honorable Tribune Alea.\n\nI fear the denizens of Vashabar within the new forest (which they call "Dawnwood") may be more than the idle tree-lovers we originally perceived them to be. The settlement is built atop Ayleid ruins and thoroughly ensconced in thick green foliage and wild growth that has never been seen in the region before. As we are dealing with Wood Elves, I find this development both disturbing and vaguely threatening.\n\nI spent several days observing the movements of the Wood Elves in Vashabar, as instructed. Remaining unseen in the forest was not difficult, but the excessive greenery did not ease my mind as to what the Wood Elves intend for West Weald. The size and density of the trees is shocking, especially given how recently the forest sprang up. It does not bode well for the farmlands and vineyards that feed Colovia. \nAs for the Wood Elves themselves, many of them appear to be simple laborers and gatherers. Their ranks also include capable hunters. They do not seem overly inclined toward violence, but I do not doubt their ability to use these weapons against any of their perceived enemies. Moreover, the hunters enjoy regular target practice. \n\nThey typically use leather targets and painted animal hides, but I once saw them use a standard-issue Legion helmet as a target. They laughed with glee when a particularly gifted archer shot the plume off the top. I do not know how they acquired the helmet, and I loathe to dwell on it.\n\nAs I have illustrated above, we must not forget the Wood Elves' proficiency with ranged weapons. Any Legion troops patrolling the border of the new forest should be heavily armored and ordered to keep their helmets on whenever they are in sight of the thick trees.\n\nA good portion of the Wood Elves also show a zealous devotion to their king, Nantharion. He is the greatest cause for concern. Through his charismatic leadership, he was able to unite multiple clans of Wood Elves to form a new settlement nearly overnight. His reputation alone may attract more followers to the region. This is certainly grounds for further surveillance and Legion reinforcements along the border of the forest. \n\nIf given the chance, I believe Nantharion would gladly expand the bounds of Vashabar, snaking his roots into the fertile land of Colovia. Under no circumstances should he be left unchecked. \n\nUntil I receive new orders, I will continue my observations. I diligently await your further instruction.
{{21337012-0-7808:}}A warning to connoisseurs of fine vintages by Orius Hertano\n\nAttempts to export the finer Skingrad vintages to Valenwood have proved to be dramatically unsuccessful. The Wood Elves, with their sacrilegious Green Pact, will not touch the product of the vine, and often violently respond to attempts to introduce wine to their diets. Instead the Wood Elves brew their own noxious concoctions from dead flesh. The most unpleasant of these foul mixtures is known as rotmeth.\n\nRotmeth is an pungent, foul-smelling beverage made primarily from fermented meat. Timber mammoth remnants and organ meat are preferred, but the offal and remnants of any suitably large creature will do. The refuse is dumped in spring water and thunderbug shells are added to the liquid. There is apparently some debate among the natives of Valenwood as to whether the lightning glands within the thunderbug's mandibles add to or distract from the final flavor of the mash. \n\nThe resulting acrid mash is stored in wide, low vats, similar to grape treading vats, and left in sunlit clearings in the forest. Over the next few weeks, the mash is diligently stirred, breaking down the decomposing meat and producing a thick, elastic gelatin on the surface. This greasy foam is then skimmed and used for treating leather and killing pests. The remaining liquids are strained through silk bags. The remaining sediment is dried and powdered, and the resulting bone flour is used to make such Wood Elf delicacies as jagga-drenched "mud-balls."\n\nRotmeth is potent and drinkable (barely) after only a few weeks, but the "best" rotmeth is laid down in clay amphoras or frosted glass demijohns and rested for years before a final straining. This weathered brew is served at weddings and other celebrations. To say that the final product is unpleasant to the taste buds is an understatement. It has the bouquet of an open midden, with the flavor of foot fungus predominately. There are notes of calcite, a few hints that remind one of water-damaged tombs, and an aftertaste of desiccated mammoth hide.\n\nThere have been attempts to "sweeten" the brew, primarily through the addition of moon-sugar. If anything, this renders the mash more toxic. No amount of sweeteners improve its taste, and rotmeth is not recommended to anyone who prefers decent beverages. \n\nThe Wood Elves, of course, swear by it.
{{21337012-0-7807:}}By Sister Priscia Stolvo \n\nDemigods such as Pelinal Whitestrake or Morihaus the Winged Bull were not the first divine aid Men received in their struggle against the Ayleids. The myths of Shor's campaigns to claim a place for Men in Atmora are well known to scholars. But less well known are Shor's deeds in Tamriel afterward. A careful examination of Nedic oral traditions, documented haphazardly in the oldest Imperial texts, traces the outlines of a fascinating (if mostly forgotten) tale.\n\nIn the Middle Merethic Era, the Mer who would become the Ayleids left Summerset to carve out new realms for themselves in Tamriel. More advanced in both warmaking and the uses of magicka than the Nedic peoples who already lived there, at first they easily subjugated or drove away their new neighbors. But slowly, the divided Nedes began to resist the Ayleid advances.\n\nTime and again in Nedic folklore, a "stranger" arrives to help ancient Men. This stranger comes as a teacher, an advisor, and a maker of alliances between tribes who otherwise would have fought alone. He is not a warrior-ruler like Shor, but instead a figure who inspires others to fight for themselves.\n\nA Duraki legend mentions "Shezarr, who stole stoneworking from the Dwemer and taught Zinfara to call nirncrux from the mountain-roots." A Perena tale claims that the Cult of Stars learned soul magic from a "white-bearded stranger." Likewise, "Shezarr of the Snowy Beard" is said to give the secrets of Ayleid battle-magic to the Nedes of Cyrod, showing them how to turn their enemies' arts against them. And, most fascinating of all, a stone tablet said to have been found in the ruins of Sedor depicts a bearded figure as "the Shezzarine, Shor-Who-Lives, Teacher of Men."\n\nTaken together, it seems these disparate tales show that Shezarr inspired many different tribes to resist Ayleid oppression. Yet the later Nedic sagas do not mention the wise stranger. Whatever part Shezarr—or Shor, in the guise of a teacher instead of a warrior—played in those days came to an end in the middle of the Merethic Era. But the ember of hope he gave to ancient Men sustained them through centuries of enslavement by the Ayleid Empire, until it at last blazed once again to inspire Saint Alessia's rebellion.
{{21337012-0-7801:}}by Telenger the Artificer\n\nSpend any amount of time among the Bosmer, and you'll notice they never seem to call each other by their given names. Everyone has some appellation or epithet that everyone else knows by heart. It can be confusing. Ask where you can find an inn and you might get an answer along the lines of, "Just past Long-Ear's house!" or "Bird Nest is heading that way, she can show you."\n\nAt first, I thought all these nicknames were simply more examples of Wood Elf humor. After all, people who enjoy a good laugh and delight in the play of words naturally coin interesting monikers for their friends and neighbors. But over several visits to Valenwood, I came to realize that there's more to the art of Bosmer nicknames than meets the eye.\n\nFirst off, nicknames are practical. Since most Wood Elves don't use family names, a nickname helps identify which individual you're referring to. If there are two Gildans in the same village, you'll find Gildan the Loud and Gildan Ale-Lover, or Gildan the Lucky and Gildan Skeever-Face, or even Gildan the Tall and Gildan the Small (frequently reversed so the taller Elf is referred to as "the Small," to the perpetual amusement of all who know them).\n\nSecond, there are nicknames and there are bynames. Nicknames are lightly given and lightly used. You can find a "Lucky" or a "Muddy-Foot" in every Wood Elf village. Bynames, on the other hand, are marks of renown (or, in some cases, infamy). A byname reflects some great deed or rare skill possessed by the bearer of the moniker. In fact, you can refer to a Bosmer by their byname alone, and any Wood Elf will know exactly who you're talking about. I've heard of a great warrior called "Long-Spear," an archer known as "Sharp-Arrow," a gifted bard known as "Songthrush," and a beloved brewer called "Golden-Keg."\n\nLastly, the most important rule of nicknames is this: You can't choose your own nickname. It takes someone respected by the clan—a wise leader, a seasoned warrior, or a gifted storyteller—to bestow a name. Be warned: Wood Elves ridicule anyone who tries to avoid a well-deserved nickname or elevate themselves by adopting a flattering byname. That's a type of renown no one should aspire to.

{{21337012-0-7802:}}By Treads-the-Stars\n\nIn Fargrave, the Celestial Palanquin of Oblivion, a tale is told of a Gleaner named Vinyehil who found a door to a place that never existed.\n\nVinyehil roamed the planes centuries ago. A seasoned traveler of strange realms, she tallied dozens of "first leaps," visiting places no mortal had seen before. Yet for every first leap she reported, Vinyehil kept another one secret. It pleased her to know of things no one else even suspected.\n\nOne day, her return from the abandoned palace of a Daedric lord did not go as she intended. Instead of appearing in the Plaza of Portals near the comforts of the Bearer's Rest, she found herself out in the desert surrounding Fargrave—so far the giant Bearers were mere bumps on the horizon. The Gleaner resigned herself to a long walk home.\n\nHow far she walked, Vinyehil could not be sure. But in time she came to a portal atop a dune, a fracture of mirror-like shards without frame or border. Vinyehil studied this portal a long time before she stepped through, since she had never seen one like it. But sooner or later, a Gleaner must find out what lies on the other side of a door. That's the Gleaner way. So Vinyehil entered.\n\nAt first, she thought she had not gone anywhere at all. The landscape looked the same on the other side. But as Vinyehil made her way down the slopes of the dune, the land began to change. The sand beneath her feet took on a shimmering silvery hue and the ghostly shapes of ruined buildings materialized around her.\n\nThe farther she walked, the more solid they seemed, until she found herself wandering in a deserted city of crystalline buildings and many-hued courts. Around her, Fargrave's desert still stretched away to the horizon. Somehow, this city of the invisible existed in the same plane as the Celestial Palanquin, a reflection sequestered away behind the fracture she had stumbled across.\n\nVinyehil determined to explore this hidden realm. Yet as she approached the heart of the ruins, she encountered a strange creature—a prismatic entity that towered over her on three sharp-pointed legs. It perceived her at once and charged. Judging this a good time to depart, Vinyehil fled. She ran back to the mirror portal, jumping through—and the ghostly echo vanished.\n\nWhen at last she reached the walls of Fargrave, Vinyehil sought answers about what she had found in the desert. No one knew of such a place or could even guess at what it might be. That was bad enough, but then Vinyehil found herself troubled by the feeling that she had forgotten something. She lingered in Fargrave, becoming more and more certain that something was terribly amiss, until she was half-mad with undefined worry.\n\nVinyehil vanished a few months after her remarkable adventure. She was last seen trekking out into the Fargrave wilderness. No one ever heard from her again. Where exactly her mirror portal lies and what it was she found on the other side remain mysteries to this day. And a challenge for future Gleaners to take up—if they have the courage.
{{21337012-0-8013:}}By Enzo Morrard\n\nFew things have shaken me to my core as much as recent revelations about the so-called "Green Pact" the Wood Elves follow. This horrendous practice is not the peaceful, tree-loving way of life they have convinced us it is. \n\nIt. Is. Cannibalism. \n\nI know, dear reader. It's shocking—but it's true. Everyone knows the Wood Elves don't farm or eat vegetables. So what do they eat instead? Meat. A lot of it.\n\nAnd where exactly do you think that meat comes from?\n\nSome Wood Elf apologists say they're hunters, that they keep livestock. But I know the truth. They gorge themselves on the flesh of their fallen foes! Sometimes they even eat each other!\n\nAfter all, why else would the Wood Elves need to become such proficient hunters? Deer and wild boars are not very hard to catch. It's men and mer that are the most challenging quarry. \n\nThis is also why their Green Pact has such harsh punishments for the tiniest mistakes. Stepping on a flower in the presence of a Wood Elf will see you swiftly tried and trussed for dinner. When foes on the battlefield run short, they will acquire provisions by any means necessary.\n\nThis monstrous behavior dates back to the earliest myths about the Wood Elves. That's right—their terrible god, Y'ffre, blessed the act of cannibalism among the elves. The perversion of their beliefs runs deeper than the roots they claim to worship. \n\nI shudder to think what a family meal in a Wood Elf settlement looks like.\n\nI beg you, reader, for your own safety do not approach any forests known to harbor Wood Elf settlements. Stick to familiar dirt paths and cobblestone streets where their vines do not reach. \n\nThey are always looking for an easy meal, and lone travelers are particularly tasty.

A task I enjoyed immensely.\n\nYes, I think this is exactly what I shall do.\n\n* * *\nLeonara moved in with me today. I'd previously slept on a small bed in a side room, plenty for me alone.

She has a room at the Fertile Respite in Skingrad.\n\nI stashed my belongings by my workbench this morning, so they should still be nearby.\n\nDon't carry my body.

{{21337012-0-8144:}}Fyrelight Cave is a delightful display of nature's underground artistry. Always worth a look. I, Carfindis Borlu, have received showers of praise for my work showing the moody, mysterious nature within.\n\nIf you go, be on your guard within Fyrelight. Perhaps even more so now, with some unrest with the very land itself here and there along the Gold Road. I have seen, in the distance, strange movement, and intriguing lights. The lithe movement of a spriggan, perhaps? And there are strange echoes, that may frighten those of a less adventurous nature. Deep, bass notes from some… creature or creatures within.\n\nSo I must both praise Fyrelight for it's mysterious beauty and caution you in the same breath for it's equally mysterious denizens.Fair travels! Look for my bulletins hither and yon as I explore Tamriel with my paints and a merry heart.\n- Carfindis Borlu, painter-at-large
{{21337012-0-8019:}}Environmental Destruction on a Grand Scale!\n\nWe are not unfamiliar with invasions. Our history is littered with the attempts of others to conquer our land. But never before has the land itself been compromised and overtaken. Are we, the denizens of Skingrad, supposed to stand idly by and watch as the ground we stand upon transforms below us? No, we are not! \n\nStand up against the new jungle. Stand up for West Weald. Stand up for Skingrad!\n\n(Brought to you by the People Opposed to the New Forest.)
{{21337012-0-7840:}}Mizzik, \n\nI apologize for letting my fear get the best of me. I was afraid telling you the truth would put your life at risk. I thought I could solve everything myself.\n\nBefore Lady Weatherleah's death, I went through Pelena's belongings. I had always suspected she was cruel, but lately she had grown erratic, nervous. Always looking over her shoulder.\n\nWhen I searched her room I discovered her correspondence with Theophan Pictor. She had Uriel killed and now his assassin is here, wearing Uriel's clothes and name like a cheap costume.\n\nI gave Lady Weatherleah a letter to prove Pelena's wrongdoing. I fear that, in doing so, I doomed her. When Pelena confronted me, she demanded I return her stolen letter. I refused. Told her I had hidden it. But she must have sensed my deceit. Known that I had revealed her betrayal to Lady Weatherleah.\n\nI'm sorry. It's all my fault.\nEdric
{{21337012-0-7842:}}If you are reading this letter, then Betu trusted you with our hidden fortune.\n\nI had hoped that, one day, I'd pass these treasures on to my son, Uriel. But I learned recently that the woman I cared for like a daughter betrayed me. And so it became necessary to hide the fortune she is clearly so hungry to acquire.\n\nI haven't gathered all the proof yet, but I called upon a dear friend who can help bring her crimes to light. If I don't live long enough to see her downfall, let this document serve to make my final wishes clear.\n\nMy dear dog Betu, and the staff that has looked after the both of us while I retreated into my grief, are to receive my remaining fortune and the estate. They are what remains of my family, and through them the memory of my dear Uriel will live on.\n\nTo Edric and Otho, I thank you for making my grieving a little more comfortable. I hope this fortune helps you look after the greatest gift my son ever gave me. My dear and faithful Betu.
{{21337012-0-7844:}}Oldest entry\nOur work can begin at last. These Ayleid ruins are the perfect—buried deep in the forest, no one will interrupt us. I can practically taste the necromantic energy infused in the tombs here. I must go, there are preparations to be completed.\n\n* * *\nNext entry\nI helped my masters identify several magical focal points within the ruins. The ground pulses with powerful energy in these spots. The dead want to be raised here, of that I'm sure. I've included a diagram of the areas with the strongest magical energy for them to reference later.\n\nWe'll begin experimenting with the components for the ritual tomorrow. I have been asked to secure a whetstone for the dagger. It's a high honor. My masters must be pleased with me!\n\nThe magic is so potent I have no doubt we will succeed. We'll soon have an undead army at our disposal. \n\n* * *\nNext entry\nMy masters have faith in me, for they have entrusted me with one of the most important pieces of the ritual: procuring the organic components for the spell. At first, I checked the tombs within the ruins, but the corpses here are ancient. The ritual will wake them, but for now we need fresher bodies.\n\nInstead, I've decided to select "donors" from among our ranks. After all, what use is an impermanent flesh vessel when a life beyond the grave stretches for eternity?\n\n* * *\nNext entry\nEverything is in place. My masters have attuned their ritual tools to the necrotic energy in the ruins. I have provided the bodies to fuel the spellwork. Tomorrow, we'll command the dead to rise.\n\n* * *\nNext entry\nSomething has gone horribly, horribly wrong. We were ready to begin the ritual in earnest. I placed the corpses in the correct locations and began chanting with the others. The necromantic energy seeped into the bodies and bedrock of the ruins, when a blast of light blinded me. The explosion threw me into a wall and I was knocked senseless.\n\nI awoke covered in blood and rubble. There were screams and the sound of fighting. I don't know who our assailants are. Most of my fellow necromancers were killed in the blast. The ones that survived were quickly overcome by the intruders. They look like some kind of Daedra, but they're unlike any I've ever seen before. They haven't noticed me yet. I pray they don't.\n\n* * *\nNext entry\nI don't know how it's possible, but my masters have returned from beyond the grave. I didn't raise them. They seem compelled to continue the ritual, even after their deaths. It feels different, somehow. Some of the words have changed and their revenants are twisted. They're not like the undead or spirits I'm used to. They terrify me. Even the otherworldly Daedra leave them alone now.\n\nI think I'm the last one left. I need to find a way out of here.\n\n* * *\nLatest entry\nThat's it. I'm making a run for it. Let this journal be my epitaph if I don't make it.

{{62156964-0-557:}}After completing the quest "The Wing of the Dragon" the magic of the Dragon Luminary causes mystical scraps of a potent Signature Script to begin appearing across Tamriel. You can acquire the Class Mastery Signature Script by combining 50 Class Script Scraps. \n\nClass Script Scraps can be found in rewards granted by:\n• Completing normal and veteran Trials\n• Opening normal and veteran Trial weekly coffers\n• Appearing on Trial leaderboards\n• Completing normal and veteran Arenas\n• Appearing on an Arena leaderboard\n• Completing the Infinite Archive\n• Opening rewards for completing daily normal and veteran Dungeons\n• Opening daily Battleground reward boxes\n• Completing Master Writs\n• Opening reward boxes granted from completing Elder Scrolls capture quests in Cyrodiil\n• Becoming Emperor in Cyrodiil
{{62156964-0-548:}}Gold Road is the 2024 chapter.\n\nManipulations, grand quests, and invasions from other planes threaten to twist prosperous West Weald into another Shattered Realm. The Scions of Ithelia and their allies from Mirrormoor will do anything to find their missing Prince and restore her power and memories. Their influence spreads chaos through the region, from the flourishing cobble-lined streets of Skingrad, to the rich vineyards that feed them, all the way to the verdant jungles of the newly formed Dawnwood. Join Leramil the Wise and allies new and old to save West Weald from certain collapse and counter the return of the Forgotten Prince.
{{62156964-0-562:}}Even without completing any of the Scribing quests, many Scripts will have a rare chance of dropping from enemies in the world. Scripts are primarily available via reward drops from completing content. You can drastically improve your chances to hunt for a particular type of script by completing the Wing of the Scholarium quest associated with each Script type. Once you unlock a Script on one character, other characters on your account can purchase that script at a discounted price.\n\nSeek |cFFFFFFFocus Scripts|r after completing the Wing of the Gryphon from daily Delve quests, daily Mages Guild quests, and PvP Rewards for the Worthy. \n\n|cFFFFFFSignature Scripts|r can be found after completing the Wing of the Dragon from daily World Boss quests, daily Cyrodiil quests, and daily Fighters Guild quests.\n\nCompleting the Wing of the Netch opens up better access to |cFFFFFFAffix Scripts|r through daily World Event quests, daily Imperial City quests, and daily Undaunted quests.
{{62156964-0-560:}}Anyone can loot Scripts from defeating enemies, but purchasing the Gold Road Chapter is required to access the Scribing system. Additionally, your character must be at least level 30, or have at least one Champion Point, in order to access Scribing.\n\nThe lost art of Scribing awaits! To begin your adventure, access the "Second Era of Scribing" quest from the Scribing collectible in the Upgrades section of the Collections menu, or simply seek out Adept Irnard Rirnil near the Mages Guild in Skingrad.

{{62156964-0-558:}}Completing the quest associated with each Wing of the Scholarium grants you the relevant Luminary's sigil. This sigil represents the Luminary's commitment to the Scholarium and their connection to the altar.

Once discovered, you can use the fast travel network to return by selecting the Lucent Citadel icon.\n\nThere are two difficulty modes available for Lucent Citadel: Normal and Veteran.

{{62156964-0-550:}}Scribing is a unique and engaging system that allows you to collect and customize brand new skills. Scribing is part of a novel adventure, where you'll discover a mystery in an ancient library and learn to shape the very heart of magic.
{{62156964-0-553:}}You must complete the quest "The Second Era of Scribing" in order to gain access to the Scribing Altar. The completion of that quest will also give you access to a Grimoire and the Scripts needed to Scribe a skill.\n\nScribing can only be completed at the Scholarium beneath Eyevea. To Scribe a Skill, interact with the Altar by pressing <<1>>.
{{62156964-0-552:}}Powerful forces from Mirrormoor assault West Weald, attempting to sow chaos and find their lost Prince. Points where the Daedric Realm intrudes on Nirn are referred to as "Mosaics." At each Mosaic, a trio of Mirrormoor Generals leads the assault. These Generals are positioned at key points around the magical locus of each Mosaic, intent on completing the ritual that will swing wide the gate between Mirrormoor and Nirn. Destroy the entities they summon from Mirrormoor and end the Three to disrupt the ritual and restore peace to West Weald. \n\nMirrormoor Mosaics are marked on the map, and become marked with crossed swords when they become active. Look for the glittering mirror crystals in the sky and the glimmering golden threads of fate in the world to find them as you approach.
{{62156964-0-555:}}Each Script holds a unique effect that you can apply to a Scribed ability. Scripts can be looted or purchased through a variety of means detailed in the Help file "How to Acquire Scripts." Once a Script is in your inventory, you can consume it to permanently unlock that Script effect at the Scribing Altar for that character.
{{62156964-0-554:}}Grimoires are the core of all Scribed skills. After purchasing a Grimoire, you can consume it to permanently unlock a new skill on that character in the relevant skill line. Grimoires cost gold, and can be purchased from Chronicler Firandil in the Scholarium after completing the quest "The Wing of the Indrik.

{{115740052-0-51403:}}Well, what do you say Vashabar? Do you support this union?
{{115740052-0-51301:}}There's a door up here, too. We'll meet you on the other side.
{{115740052-0-51402:}}Nahlia, adventurer. You made it.
{{115740052-0-51401:}}No one's fault but mine. I brought us here. Caelum won't kill her—yet. But we have to find them, quickly!
{{115740052-0-51407:}}A marvelous display of power! Precisely what I wished to see.
{{115740052-0-51405:}}Rise, Aut'arioth!
{{115740052-0-51404:}}Hah, there it is! Congratulations you two. Let's give the couple a moment. Drinks for everyone!
{{115740052-0-51409:}}The Luminaries. Look!
{{115740052-0-51256:}}What have we here? That's a new face. What a shame it's not prettier.
{{115740052-0-51408:}}I am the Crow, a piece of Ulfsild left behind to see Scribing passed to you. To the world.
{{115740052-0-51327:}}Will it be enough for those that come after? Will anyone follow in my footsteps? I refuse to believe all this work was for nothing.
{{115740052-0-51324:}}This must be the Crow's domain. Incredible! Maybe those echoes can tell us more.
{{115740052-0-51568:}}Now! Give them no quarter!
{{115740052-0-51569:}}Watch out! The Shardmarshal's waiting for us!
{{115740052-0-51564:}}Of course. Please, allow me to reverse the spell.
{{115740052-0-51565:}}Oh, thank Y'ffre that's over!
{{115740052-0-51560:}}My Prince, help me!
{{115740052-0-51561:}}Oh no. You're not going to ruin this for us!
{{115740052-0-51563:}}Arkay help us! This place is full of traps!
{{115740052-0-49162:}}That key must unlock these gates. Let us continue, proxy. I sense that what we seek lies somewhere to the south.
{{115740052-0-49606:}}There! That spirit is channeling the ritual. Quickly, find and burn its corpse!
{{115740052-0-49653:}}Enough! Forces of Mirrormoor, aid me!
{{115740052-0-49651:}}Just as I suspected, fresh blood to feed the spell.
{{115740052-0-49650:}}Deputy, over here.
{{115740052-0-49656:}}Argh! Reality tears, here in Apocrypha! Go on ahead and I'll see if I can do anything to slow them down.
{{115740052-0-49655:}}That path leads to the forbidden parts of the realm.
{{115740052-0-49654:}}Oh, Mizzik! Do you have updates on your investigation?
{{115740052-0-49659:}}Quickly friend, search the pantry! Mizzik hopes we can save at least one life today.
{{115740052-0-49658:}}We have to help him!
{{115740052-0-52131:}}No! A trap! It's that petrification gas! Take the Emblem to Elfbetta! I … I …
{{115740052-0-49442:}}Doomed! We're all doomed! Mortal, reality itself is threatened!
{{115740052-0-49444:}}Um, that's not good. Examine it, mortal. But carefully! Very carefully.
{{115740052-0-49561:}}Abolisher is depleted, but it did its job. The Loom has been destroyed. I shall open an exit. Let us leave this place.
{{115740052-0-50581:}}Oh, hello. Another of our Recollection friends, eh? He stepped on that grate too, I see, with more permanent results. A shame he isn't as skillful and dexterous as I.
{{115740052-0-50580:}}This could have been me, mere moments ago. Thank the gods for my quick reflexes.
{{115740052-0-50582:}}Ack! What is this? Assistant! Don't you have anything to say about getting me caught up in this noxious mist? You were the one to trip the trap!
{{115740052-0-51396:}}We're doing great! Keep it up!
{{115740052-0-50585:}}Three of the Loyal Retainers! Stand back, assistant! I'll speak their names and command them!
{{115740052-0-50584:}}Best be on our way. Keep an eye out for these grates, if you would, assistant.
{{115740052-0-51390:}}Dig, dig, dig. Here's a focal point to start you off. Watch your step!
{{115740052-0-51028:}}Are they gone? The sounds of combat stopped.
{{115740052-0-51065:}}I'll help Julian and Irnard set up wards, this won't happen again on my watch.
{{115740052-0-51064:}}Seems we have a pest problem of sorts.
{{115740052-0-51067:}}There's our imposter! Talk to him, friend.
{{115740052-0-51066:}}What is with all the questions, cousin? Aren't you happy to see me?
{{115740052-0-51063:}}Sorry about that one, adventurer. I need to brief you.
{{115740052-0-51062:}}It seems Lady Weatherleah lead her own investigation into her son's death.
{{115740052-0-51069:}}Let us see if we can find any clues among the mess.
{{115740052-0-51068:}}If the room has truly been locked this whole time, then not even the killer could reenter.
{{115740052-0-49198:}}What say you, Prince of Paths? Will you accept eternal banishment in a realm where your power does not exist?
{{115740052-0-49199:}}And allow me to show you how to open that path, while I still have the will to do so.
{{115740052-0-49192:}}You risk everything, Ithelia. You must forsake the Many Paths.
{{115740052-0-49193:}}Ithelia, it is time to resume your imprisonment.
{{115740052-0-49194:}}You seek to diminish my Prince. Why should she agree to such a demand?
{{115740052-0-49195:}}To preserve reality. Her willfulness threatens all of existence.
{{115740052-0-49196:}}You let your fear control you and foresee an apocalypse that will never be. Depart, Mora!
{{115740052-0-49448:}}Lazen is back there!
{{115740052-0-49235:}}What exactly are you implying, Colovian?
{{115740052-0-49837:}}Bears. They can be sly and sneaky, so be on your guard.
{{115740052-0-49237:}}That's enough, tribune!
{{115740052-0-49236:}}I'm not implying, I'm saying it outright! This land wasn't yours to grow a forest over!
{{115740052-0-49239:}}Fine! You and the mercenary handle it.
{{115740052-0-49238:}}Apologies, greenspeaker. What can you tell us about the seed my friend is carrying?
{{115740052-0-51416:}}I am the shadow of a singular person. A being born in sorrow but filled with hope.
{{115740052-0-49366:}}What in Oblivion did we just see?
{{115740052-0-50531:}}Sage's Dream, do you have it?
{{115740052-0-50279:}}I just hope this is the start of better things for Ontus.
{{115740052-0-50278:}}The dungeons? They should face an executioner's ax for what they did!
{{115740052-0-50273:}}True or not, it does not matter. You are not one of them, Cirthan.
{{115740052-0-50272:}}I haven't lived among the Tree Folk for some time, but I can't believe the latest rumors.
{{115740052-0-50271:}}Hard work is the same all over, and the illness will pass.
{{115740052-0-50270:}}But all we found here was hard work and terrible sickness.
{{115740052-0-50277:}}Yes! And I heard Carvain and Raxalee were sent to the count's dungeons!
{{115740052-0-50276:}}Did you hear, my love? Constable Yabren and the new deputy saved Ontus!
{{115740052-0-50275:}}We should not care what they think. And we should not care what happens in the new forest.
{{115740052-0-50274:}}It matters to the other quarriers, my love. And to the ranch hands.
{{115740052-0-49767:}}An attack? You dare!
{{115740052-0-49766:}}Go. Take your forces and capture the keep. I will gather reinforcements in Mirrormoor.
{{115740052-0-49765:}}This place should serve. Tell Nantharion to bring a seed here. And suggest he guard this seed better than the last few.
{{115740052-0-49764:}}With the wards destroyed, the way into Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum should be open now.
{{115740052-0-49763:}}Good work, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49762:}}Another ward. Destroy it!
{{115740052-0-49761:}}Well done. Let us find the next one.
{{115740052-0-49760:}}That must be one of the wards. Destroy it!
{{115740052-0-51566:}}Mindiras, my love, you're back! Sarragwen, I revoke my charges. Let the stranger leave and put this behind us.
{{115740052-0-50201:}}And a strangler's maw looks inviting, but I don't want to get eaten!
{{115740052-0-49353:}}Listen, you! I want answers from Nantharion and I want them now!
{{115740052-0-49354:}}She came back? Seize her!
{{115740052-0-49358:}}With that oil and the combustion canisters, we're all set. Let's find those weapon stockpiles.
{{115740052-0-49359:}}Careful. One spark and you'll be engulfed in alchemical fire.
{{115740052-0-51865:}}That did it! The portal is closing.
{{115740052-0-51864:}}The portal is damaged! Gather more energy and do it again.
{{115740052-0-51866:}}Remember Abolisher's power should we encounter more of these Mirrormoor portals.
{{115740052-0-51862:}}Remember, Abolisher gathers energy from each foe you fell.
{{115740052-0-51487:}}You cannot deny my vengeance. You wanted my riches? Take them to your graves!
{{115740052-0-51241:}}That ale really packs a punch! I might take a nap for a minute.
{{115740052-0-51249:}}I'm telling you, there's been a mistake! Give me a chance to explain!
{{115740052-0-51244:}}Well, that was embarrassing. Don't worry, I already took her back. Can we speak, friend?
{{115740052-0-51246:}}No, no, no! I'm trapped! Please, someone help me!
{{115740052-0-51359:}}Don't lose focus! Val, Knives, Big Urm—search the far side of the vineyard for signs of Marcan Caelum. I'll take this side with our friend.
{{115740052-0-51358:}}It's so desolate. How much of this is our doing?
{{115740052-0-49110:}}You should take a look at the library. I'll meet you there.
{{115740052-0-49111:}}Certainly a ladder couldn't have caused this much damage to the statue.
{{115740052-0-49112:}}You are certain this is where you found her body?
{{115740052-0-49113:}}Yes, I'll never forget the sight of her lying there.
{{115740052-0-49114:}}Quite the mess for a simple fall, don't you think?
{{115740052-0-49115:}}Was that window already broken?
{{115740052-0-49117:}}Something has broken the glass. Perhaps this was an escape route?
{{115740052-0-51127:}}I know that this situation is hard to accept, but I wish the Gryphon and the Fox would understand. This isn't a fight we can win.
{{115740052-0-50794:}}She meant for us to buy a home! Not lavish meals!
{{115740052-0-51417:}}I know that smell. There's brandy in these casks.
{{115740052-0-50563:}}You try my patience, mortal!
{{115740052-0-50567:}}Haldain bought us time. Let me work and we can make sure his sacrifice was worth it.
{{115740052-0-50566:}}The screaming stopped. Do you think Haldain's all right?
{{115740052-0-50564:}}You agitate me to no end, mortal!
{{115740052-0-49257:}}The wildburn is but a tool, my Prince. A way to awaken the Ayleid magic sleeping beneath this land.
{{115740052-0-49254:}}That's one seed. It looks like there's another one deeper in.
{{115740052-0-49259:}}Yes, the Well of Miscarcand. I remember it now.
{{115740052-0-49258:}}Fine. I'll wait here.
{{115740052-0-48970:}}The One Who Knows needs us, proxy!
{{115740052-0-49063:}}The Skein indicates that the wards are somewhere above. Look for a passage leading up.
{{115740052-0-50769:}}Come here, little friend. I won't hurt you!
{{115740052-0-50768:}}Ah! There you are! I was beginning to get worried.
{{115740052-0-50761:}}I lost? Give me one more chance!
{{115740052-0-50760:}}I'll win it all back and then some.
{{115740052-0-50763:}}Just go home, Zedrich.
{{115740052-0-50762:}}I'll win next time, I'm sure.
{{115740052-0-50765:}}Who's that stranger?
{{115740052-0-50764:}}Careful, Zedrich. You still owe from last game.
{{115740052-0-50767:}}Ah! Oh, it's only you.
{{115740052-0-48969:}}The Skein leads us to that cave, proxy.
{{115740052-0-51498:}}I'll meet you soon. There's something I have to do in Black Marsh. It might help Val.
{{115740052-0-51499:}}You all … don't have to do … so much for me.
{{115740052-0-51494:}}I'd like that. Aye, I'd like that a lot.
{{115740052-0-51149:}}The second key fragment! Look at you go!
{{115740052-0-49099:}}Over here, proxy! Use the Mirror of Truth!
{{115740052-0-51473:}}The exit is blocked! We're trapped!
{{115740052-0-51471:}}The fire's spreading!
{{115740052-0-50872:}}Ah, a visitor on a mission! Like a ringtail after a beetle.
{{115740052-0-48930:}}Maybe? Nothing like this has ever been attempted.
{{115740052-0-48933:}}That's all of them, right? You should get back to Beragon's place. And say hello to Leramil for me.
{{115740052-0-48932:}}That's the final relic? Good. Let's meet Leramil and Scruut back at Beragon's townhouse.
{{115740052-0-48934:}}That was the last of the relics? Good. Let's rendezvous with Leramil and Scruut back at my townhouse.
{{115740052-0-48937:}}Hmm. It appears the grapes did not agree with this death hound.
{{115740052-0-48936:}}Betu! Where has that dog gone?
{{115740052-0-48939:}}Let's look more closely at those grapes.
{{115740052-0-48938:}}An injured field hand. Let's find out what happened.
{{115740052-0-49789:}}Just ring the bell in the proper sequence and the alert will be sounded.
{{115740052-0-49788:}}Up here, friend!
{{115740052-0-49781:}}Beautiful Lady Sowerra, start your choreography from the back!
{{115740052-0-49780:}}All right, Lady Sowerra. Begin your routine from the front!
{{115740052-0-49783:}}Now this will be wonderful! Let us redouble our efforts and practice fervently, now! Thank you for all your advice, friend.
{{115740052-0-49286:}}Tham's favorite, torn but no blood. Could be a good sign. Maybe.
{{115740052-0-51146:}}Scruut … is correct. This falls to you and me, proxy.
{{115740052-0-51147:}}Ciiril! What's the meaning of this? Someone explain to me what's going on!
{{115740052-0-50138:}}The Terror will make you pay for destroying our weapons, Maerenah!
{{115740052-0-50139:}}That's not all I plan to destroy, you bastards.
{{115740052-0-50130:}}Good to know I was right about the portal. Let's figure out where we are and find the source of all this unstable magic.
{{115740052-0-50131:}}This architecture is Elven. We must still be near Summerset.
{{115740052-0-50132:}}Do you feel that surge of magic? We're getting close.
{{115740052-0-50134:}}Eyes of Magnus! Where are we? What is this place?
{{115740052-0-50135:}}The new forest worries me. Nothing natural ever grew that quickly!
{{115740052-0-51267:}}I'll meet you in Vashabar. We have to find my vanity before she does something regrettable.
{{115740052-0-51265:}}I'm so sorry for what she, well, I, did to your wife. Let me make amends.
{{115740052-0-51264:}}You can try to stop me, but we both know I'm part of you, and I always will be.
{{115740052-0-51263:}}Darling, we're one and the same. I'll accept you, but you'll never hurt anyone again.
{{115740052-0-51262:}}Back off, you simpering fool!
{{115740052-0-51261:}}Fine, but make it quick.
{{115740052-0-51269:}}I know, little bug. Please, help me move this!
{{115740052-0-51268:}}No, you must not bring that reflection any closer! Speak with me and I shall explain.
{{115740052-0-49684:}}The Shardborn are endless, mortal!
{{115740052-0-49685:}}Betu! He's recovering. The herbs must be working.
{{115740052-0-49686:}}Wonderful news. Traveler, let's discuss the note you found with our imposter.
{{115740052-0-49687:}}Betu, what is it? Where are you going?
{{115740052-0-49682:}}Take Abolisher if you can, mortal. Ah! No!
{{115740052-0-49683:}}Proxy, I am familiar with those relics.
{{115740052-0-49688:}}Quickly, follow that dog!
{{115740052-0-49538:}}You cannot contain me forever, Mora. In time, I will escape this cell.
{{115740052-0-49539:}}No fate that I foresee results in your freedom. I am sorry, Ithelia, but I do this to preserve reality.
{{115740052-0-49537:}}This is how it must be, Ithelia. For the sake of reality, you cannot walk free.
{{115740052-0-49532:}}Ithelia can use the Loom to change history? That is how she will restore what was lost!
{{115740052-0-49530:}}The Loom will weave a new story for every being, what they choose to be true. All shall benefit!
{{115740052-0-49531:}}A wonderful gift indeed, my Prince!
{{115740052-0-50359:}}The shrine of Azura should be just up ahead.
{{115740052-0-50859:}}Then seek my annotated fable at the meeting of many paths. A room full of doors with no hinges.
{{115740052-0-50858:}}If she asks if you are my inheritor, do not agree or disagree. Insist upon taking her trial.
{{115740052-0-50850:}}Clear the rubble!
{{115740052-0-50857:}}On the path to ally with the Dragon you must choose your words carefully.
{{115740052-0-50855:}}He's got Tham! Let's finish the bastard!
{{115740052-0-49949:}}Fine, fine. I'lll keep myself occupied with our newly-arrived friend, here.
{{115740052-0-49948:}}Hold that thought, Isayas. I just came up with a rebuttal to the Mundus-Lachrymose theory. That old buffoon from Auridon won't be able to get around this.
{{115740052-0-51173:}}The enemy approaches! They come to imprison my Prince.
{{115740052-0-51172:}}I came as quick as I could. Search the wreckage for clues. It hurts when I bend down right now.
{{115740052-0-51171:}}Ah, I see. Must've injured himself fighting those beasts out there. No matter. Healers? Heal this man. And make sure Burnbiscuit here didn't break a claw! Oh, you there. I suppose you want a reward?
{{115740052-0-51170:}}I've got them. What happened at the reservoir, deputy?
{{115740052-0-51177:}}Ah, what is this? This one is flying!
{{115740052-0-51176:}}No, wait! Ugh. This is hopeless.
{{115740052-0-50307:}}Excellent. Ulfsild's annotations will tell you where you need to go.
{{115740052-0-50301:}}We are the Legion! Anything's possible!
{{115740052-0-50300:}}What? That's impossible!
{{115740052-0-51644:}}You will live, Brendenir.
{{115740052-0-48883:}}Did it work? I think it worked! The relic is restored!
{{115740052-0-51410:}}She wisely used her power to ensure her legacy.
{{115740052-0-51411:}}Ulfsild's keen mind ensured you could follow in her footsteps.
{{115740052-0-51412:}}She was a fierce protector, defiant for what she cared about most.
{{115740052-0-51413:}}Her compassion lifted everyone around her. Just as it lifted you!
{{115740052-0-51414:}}I have soared on the winds of magic for centuries to be here with you today. Inheritor.
{{115740052-0-49019:}}The tharriker grow restless. We have that in common. It's time we left these woods behind.
{{115740052-0-49018:}}I'm certain Grander will wonder whether he was inadequate. Unworthy, of my love.
{{115740052-0-49017:}}Contracts be damned. I know my worth and Grander should come to learn his.
{{115740052-0-49016:}}What use have I for collars of gold and silver?
{{115740052-0-49010:}}Tread carefully, adventurer. I've had my fill of impish fools with childish dreams.
{{115740052-0-49013:}}You're facing the best of Dark Company now, fools!
{{115740052-0-51347:}}And a greenspring seed for me. Friend, you helped us find them. Please bring them forth.
{{115740052-0-51349:}}When you are ready, I shall accompany you, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49595:}}Something hides here. I feel its hatred, thick and sour. Perhaps I can call it to us.
{{115740052-0-50408:}}Make sure you do. I have no intent to serve as a wine glass for my husband!
{{115740052-0-50409:}}Ursilia. I suppose I owe you an explanation.
{{115740052-0-50402:}}Give me more time, I can figure out what's upsetting them. I can calm them down!
{{115740052-0-50403:}}They have tasting rooms?
{{115740052-0-50404:}}Friend, you're needed again!
{{115740052-0-50405:}}You again! What are you doing in my husband's office?
{{115740052-0-51757:}}Use my strength well.
{{115740052-0-51754:}}It's time for your final trial? The last door?
{{115740052-0-51753:}}We will see if the Crow deems you worthy. If you are the inheritor of the Scholarium. See you on the other side.
{{115740052-0-51752:}}Through you, my work finally lives on. Gather any allies you choose.
{{115740052-0-51751:}}Congratulations. You've accomplished incredible things.
{{115740052-0-51750:}}Ah, at last. We come to the final wing.
{{115740052-0-51759:}}Go, and carry my strength. You will always be welcome here.
{{115740052-0-51758:}}Rejoin my domain to the altar. May you master Scribing as you master yourself.
{{115740052-0-49129:}}There you are. Quickly, let's speak.
{{115740052-0-49127:}}The time has come! Let's gather for the auction.
{{115740052-0-49126:}}One second, I'm just finishing—Oh. Hello there, what can I do for you?
{{115740052-0-49121:}}Until the investigation is complete, everyone is a suspect.
{{115740052-0-49120:}}I would never hurt <<1>>!
{{115740052-0-50071:}}Hurry, now. The portal I opened should carry us as far as the Loom's core.
{{115740052-0-50644:}}All right, now we can get to the real business.
{{115740052-0-50642:}}Balandrus must be keeping the bloodfiends in dens. Just follow the sound of their wails and we'll use the remaining explosives.
{{115740052-0-50643:}}Excellent … wait, nothing is happening. Is it broken? Do I have a broken altar? Surely the sacred water must be the solution, I'm sure of it.
{{115740052-0-50640:}}And now, anoint the altar with the sacred water! With this, our way is opened!
{{115740052-0-51595:}}Make sure no one follows me.
{{115740052-0-51594:}}Beragon! Oh, who's your friend?
{{115740052-0-49608:}}Over there! Another body is fueling the necrotic ritual. Burn it!
{{115740052-0-52067:}}Ithelia and Vargas have reached the loom's core. We must reach them before they destroy the reality we know.
{{115740052-0-49197:}}I accept that fate, Hermaeus Mora.
{{115740052-0-49389:}}What a loss. I found that letter clutched in his hand.
{{115740052-0-49443:}}A tear in the fabric of reality! Not only have the threads of fate been parted … a piece of existence has been destroyed!
{{115740052-0-49446:}}Mortal, I think I know what's happening here. Let's talk.
{{115740052-0-49447:}}We shall send Gadayn, Beragon, and Tribune Alea to assist you, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49445:}}An unexpected reaction, but it tells us much.
{{115740052-0-50098:}}He wanted a monster? Behold, the Last Tomorrow! Behold, the Destroyer of Reality!
{{115740052-0-50322:}}Ithelia has become … something else.
{{115740052-0-50388:}}Really? You're the first of Lord Valente's guests to accept the wine. I hope you enjoy it.
{{115740052-0-50380:}}They're after us! And Ghrakug! I'll go warn him. You destroy this alchemical equipment.
{{115740052-0-50328:}}There you are! We were separated in the portal somehow.
{{115740052-0-48874:}}Now that you have the relics, I suppose I must open a portal to the instability. This way, mortals.
{{115740052-0-48870:}}<Whines Worriedly>
{{115740052-0-48872:}}Who's a good boy, Lazen? You are!
{{115740052-0-48873:}}We saved West Weald and preserved history. But Prince Ithelia still roams free.
{{115740052-0-51388:}}Careful! You need those hands to fight.
{{115740052-0-51389:}}I can sniff out the path as you break the wards.
{{115740052-0-51038:}}My first mission. My first brush with death. The Reachfolk had us on the run. I was so far from home and certain I'd die alone.
{{115740052-0-51039:}}Borderwatch. The day I thought Elic would join me as a soldier in my new assignment. The day he would break my heart.
{{115740052-0-51036:}}You have such a remarkable way of setting books down. Very deliberate!
{{115740052-0-51037:}}Reward the mortal if it pleases you, my Prince, but greater victory awaits us in Mirrormoor.
{{115740052-0-51034:}}A good point. There is no telling what we may encounter. Still, that is our course.
{{115740052-0-51032:}}Meet us at Beragon's townhouse when you have restored the relics. And, if you would, convey my regards to Gadayn.
{{115740052-0-51033:}}How exactly do we prepare ourselves for Oblivion?
{{115740052-0-51030:}}No matter, we can still search the sunken ruins. This way.
{{115740052-0-51031:}}We must enter the cave and see this tear for ourselves.
{{115740052-0-49478:}}This realm so easily bends to Ithelia's will. Could Fargrave be a cast-off portion of Mirrormoor?
{{115740052-0-49473:}}Hmm. Beragon and Tribune Alea were right behind us, but have not yet appeared. We should confer, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49472:}}Curious. This is Fargrave. Did Ithelia come this way to make use of the Celestial Palanquin?
{{115740052-0-49471:}}Very well. If I cannot restore Mirrormoor, I will create a new realm—upon the festering corpse of Apocrypha!
{{115740052-0-49470:}}Is nothing salvageable, my Prince?
{{115740052-0-49477:}}The crystal grows more prominent, as if Mirrormoor follows in its Prince's wake.
{{115740052-0-49474:}}Apocrypha! Proxy, we must talk!
{{115740052-0-51195:}}There are monsters everywhere! Just get away from me!
{{115740052-0-50936:}}I'm not drunk, Fennorian! I only had a glass or two.
{{115740052-0-51197:}}Beragon and Tribune Alea are beyond our help for now. We must go on without them.
{{115740052-0-51099:}}You did it! The portal's closing!
{{115740052-0-51626:}}That's just the right amount of harkfruit juice. No need for more.
{{115740052-0-51624:}}Perfectly chilled! Now to blend the drink. Two parts steeped tirum weed and harkfruit juice for every one part of chilled lute berries.
{{115740052-0-51620:}}The harkfruit looks properly reduced. Now add lute berries to the apparatus.
{{115740052-0-51291:}}Comrade? Comrade where are you?
{{115740052-0-50481:}}Another Ithelia? So powerful and proud. Collect the ingredient and let us go back, mortal.
{{115740052-0-50482:}}No, Torvesard. They are … different. Approach, pathwalker, and speak with me.
{{115740052-0-50483:}}Here. I offer you a path home. Take it with my blessing.
{{115740052-0-50484:}}My work? Oh, adventurer. I think I know what he's doing.
{{115740052-0-50485:}}Sorry, Goblin researcher. Looks like I won.
{{115740052-0-50487:}}Ask your precious researcher. Her work's very enlightening.
{{115740052-0-50488:}}Finding the knife we planted won't change anything, Pim.
{{115740052-0-50489:}}You stole the knife? Why?
{{115740052-0-49836:}}These deserters turned bandits have no honor! They killed legionaries for no good reason!
{{115740052-0-51511:}}Not yet, friend! We can't enter the bell tower until we recover everything the captain requested.
{{115740052-0-51510:}}You there! Let's help these people.
{{115740052-0-51513:}}Oh! Please, help. It's all destroyed.
{{115740052-0-51894:}}Welcome to Rootwater Grove! I can smell my way to Apocrypha. I'll meet you where the wall is thinnest!
{{115740052-0-51895:}}Here comes the mercenary now. Talk to Beragon, comrade.
{{115740052-0-51897:}}I'm not done yet.
{{115740052-0-51890:}}You return. Echoes of your success precede you.
{{115740052-0-51891:}}And with that, the power of the Dragon has been restored to the altar.
{{115740052-0-51892:}}We've done all we can here. Let's head back to the Scholarium and speak with you know who.
{{115740052-0-51893:}}You're here! The wall is thinnest at the back of the ruin. I'll see you there!
{{115740052-0-49363:}}No sign of the king, but the map and notes might be important. Take them, friend.
{{115740052-0-49362:}}Over here! This must be a Recollection command post.
{{115740052-0-49365:}}Is that … yes, I believe they call it a tavern. I see the Many Paths converging there.
{{115740052-0-49364:}}Where am I? What force draws me to this place?
{{115740052-0-49596:}}This place reeks of death. We need to find and burn the bodies fueling the ritual.
{{115740052-0-49590:}}Perhaps you can make sense of it.
{{115740052-0-49593:}}It seems Pelena made her feelings about the cook quite clear to Lady Weatherleah.
{{115740052-0-51591:}}Maybe. But it's up to us to earn those promised rewards. We'll have to fight for them.
{{115740052-0-51590:}}Look around you. This forest is just the first of the changes we have been promised.
{{115740052-0-51598:}}Keep an eye out, could be anything in here.
{{115740052-0-50078:}}They've probably already got him. I doubt Nantharion's sentries could fight off a Recollection army.
{{115740052-0-51308:}}Aye!
{{115740052-0-51309:}}Give me that blade, Vargas.
{{115740052-0-51304:}}Good to see you, comrade. Beragon's waiting for you in the relic room.
{{115740052-0-51305:}}Aye!
{{115740052-0-51306:}}Aye!
{{115740052-0-51307:}}Aye!
{{115740052-0-51300:}}You're beating them? No matter, you'll never catch up to me.
{{115740052-0-51302:}}Hello, friend! Put the relics in the case, please—they may be powerless now, but we shouldn't forget the part they played in all this.
{{115740052-0-51303:}}I'm not sure I want to keep those in my house forever, but that's good for now. Let's talk.
{{115740052-0-49164:}}We found the shrine. But who is—oh. That is Ithelia! Perhaps you can talk to her, proxy.
{{115740052-0-52281:}}SAT Music
{{115740052-0-50538:}}We'll see if this Recollection fanatic's tongue loosens up when the Legion reinforcements arrive. Varen's Watch will be ours again in no time!
{{115740052-0-50843:}}Because this whole family can rot for all I care!
{{115740052-0-49431:}}That's the key! Now let's go open the catacombs. The door is across from the barracks.
{{115740052-0-51259:}}I can't believe it. Please, friend, I must speak with you!
{{115740052-0-51110:}}Warriors of Mirrormoor, defend your Prince!
{{115740052-0-51431:}}My days will end soon, I think. But they end happy. With me at my little desk, in my little home, scratching away in some journals.
{{115740052-0-51119:}}Interesting. Let's talk about how to proceed, friend.
{{115740052-0-51118:}}What are we waiting for then? Let's finish this.
{{115740052-0-51872:}}Tribune Alea, come forth!
{{115740052-0-49738:}}Thank the Eight! I thought that was my grave.
{{115740052-0-49739:}}It hurts so much, sister.
{{115740052-0-49730:}}The Many Paths splinter. You manipulate fate in ways that were not meant to be!
{{115740052-0-49731:}}What I do I do for the good of all. Why can you not see that, Mora?
{{115740052-0-49732:}}I am not alone in my concerns, Ithelia. Constrain yourself or we will constrain you.
{{115740052-0-49733:}}And you will fail! Now begone!
{{115740052-0-49734:}}A memory of Ithelia arguing with Hermaeus Mora! Have you ever seen such a thing? Friend, we should talk.
{{115740052-0-49737:}}Help! I can't get out. The door's blocked.
{{115740052-0-50775:}}I know. The law won't forget our mistakes, but this time, we do the right thing. We can catch this coward. Together.
{{115740052-0-50772:}}Y'ffre's beard! How does Hinulbor make it look so easy?
{{115740052-0-51818:}}Go! Finish what we started!
{{115740052-0-51819:}}The work isn't over yet.
{{115740052-0-51816:}}The null arca is right there!
{{115740052-0-51811:}}We lost the legionary. There's too many Daedra!
{{115740052-0-51812:}}The legionary's safe. Nice work.
{{115740052-0-51652:}}Of course! Happy to be of service.
{{115740052-0-50142:}}Do you have the strength to seek me out?
{{115740052-0-50144:}}It's been too long since someone basked in my presence.
{{115740052-0-50147:}}Hello? Oh no. Is someone there?
{{115740052-0-50146:}}Two moons ascend this star-pocked night. One a Lamp, and one her light.
{{115740052-0-50149:}}Did you hear? The king of Vashabar, he's the leader of the Recollection!
{{115740052-0-50148:}}Adventurer! I need you up here. Now!
{{115740052-0-49504:}}Cracked acorns, we missed the battle! But I think that takes care of everything here. Let's be off.
{{115740052-0-49503:}}Friends, we need to get out of here!
{{115740052-0-49501:}}That did something. Try interacting with more of the mirrors.
{{115740052-0-49500:}}The symbols in the mirrors match the symbols above the arch. That must indicate something.
{{115740052-0-49509:}}I am curious to see the loom of which Ithelia spoke. Let us proceed.
{{115740052-0-50805:}}Wildburn seed? Not sure what that could be, but the handwriting at the bottom, that's Sorilen's.
{{115740052-0-50806:}}Be angry all you want, dear wife, but don't cause a scene. I'm here to stay.
{{115740052-0-50807:}}I'm here, friend. If you're ready, let's head inside.
{{115740052-0-50800:}}You over there! The helper. The Scarlets don't deserve your protection. Leave them to their fate. This is my final warning.
{{115740052-0-50801:}}Enough! You cannot stop me!
{{115740052-0-50802:}}Rise, minions, and break this fool's bones!
{{115740052-0-50803:}}These notes … it's like the killer knew how to get under each Scarlet's skin. They've been watching us.
{{115740052-0-50808:}}The Heartland Elves never did anything halfway, did they?
{{115740052-0-50809:}}The wildlife down here might see us as a threat.
{{115740052-0-51669:}}Mirrormoor stands ready, my Prince. Weave a better reality with your Loom!
{{115740052-0-51668:}}The Loom awaits, my Prince. Reshape the fates and restore the glory of Mirrormoor!
{{115740052-0-51663:}}That's too many lute berries. We'll begin again.
{{115740052-0-51662:}}You poured too much harkfruit juice. No problem, we'll start again.
{{115740052-0-51661:}}Too much tirum weed. We'll start a new blend.
{{115740052-0-51667:}}Just think! No one's set foot in here in ages … except for any Ayleid undead that might be around.
{{115740052-0-51666:}}This looks promising! I think we're close to the parts of Niryastare I remember.
{{115740052-0-51665:}}No Recollection sentries? There must be a reason why they're not guarding this passage.
{{115740052-0-49208:}}The barrel where I stashed the payroll should be around here.
{{115740052-0-49209:}}On my way out, I tossed the bell tower key in a stack of hay in the southern stables.
{{115740052-0-49200:}}Then allow me to turn my gaze upon the Many Paths, to find a worthy reality.
{{115740052-0-49201:}}Ithelia disappeared as soon as the memory ended. Let us speak outside.
{{115740052-0-49202:}}Ithelia is gone, no longer a threat. But proxy, we should speak.
{{115740052-0-51917:}}Act with justice.
{{115740052-0-50738:}}There we are! Now to return to the altar. I'll go ahead and dust myself off a bit from the battle. Take the wine on your way out. We'll be needing that.
{{115740052-0-50736:}}Argh!
{{115740052-0-51815:}}You have the arcane knot?
{{115740052-0-51462:}}Prove your mettle, outsider!
{{115740052-0-49046:}}Right, there's the pattern. Pay attention.
{{115740052-0-49047:}}Great! It's untethered. Now just grab the shard.
{{115740052-0-49044:}}Easier than I thought getting here. Let's talk.
{{115740052-0-49045:}}Stand near the shard and activate the Alarum.
{{115740052-0-49040:}}We must locate those hidden wards, proxy. Perhaps the Skein of Secrets can serve us here.
{{115740052-0-49048:}}No, that's not it. Try again, or talk to me if you need a reminder on what to do.
{{115740052-0-51813:}}Look! Greenspeaker Sorilen, up on the walkway.
{{115740052-0-50479:}}Hey! Over by the gate!
{{115740052-0-50478:}}Narsis Dren is no stranger to a puzzle, but can his assistant exhibit the same prowess? Let's wait and see! Go on now, read that epitaph.
{{115740052-0-50937:}}Ursilia, about your husband ….
{{115740052-0-49094:}}Your reality, fate-seer, not mine. Witness the ascension of the Prince of Paths to her rightful place of power!
{{115740052-0-48962:}}Totally unnecessary. I'll find him. Thanks!
{{115740052-0-48963:}}Just a moment. Let's talk first.
{{115740052-0-48961:}}Who's this then? Idolus? What is it you want?
{{115740052-0-50679:}}Our dear lady is dead and you still don't believe me.
{{115740052-0-50678:}}Get it together, Edric. You're a mess.
{{115740052-0-50677:}}What's that? Mizzik hears voices. Let us listen in.
{{115740052-0-50676:}}Ah, greetings traveler! Perhaps you can help Mizzik in his search?
{{115740052-0-50674:}}Hmm. It seems Mizzik has been fooled by a four-legged escape artist.
{{115740052-0-50670:}}Let's make this quick!
{{115740052-0-49157:}}Betu? Betu, what's wrong boy?
{{115740052-0-51233:}}Now is the time to put these stolen magics to use. Burn with the fires of the Deadlands.
{{115740052-0-51234:}}Let rise the shadows of Evergloam. And writhe with the ancient power of Apocrypha.
{{115740052-0-51235:}}Cheers to you, my friend! Well? Drink up!
{{115740052-0-49483:}}A memory of Torvesard and Vargas before they recovered what had been forgotten. Let us talk.
{{115740052-0-49910:}}Deputy, you stop the mercenaries. I'll go after Carvain and Raxalee.
{{115740052-0-49911:}}Your wanderings are futile, Torvesard. What you seek is here. The Loom of the Untraveled Road. I have no idea what it is, but I am certain it's important.
{{115740052-0-49912:}}You can stare at the sealed portal until you go mad, Vargas. I go in search of my missing memories.
{{115740052-0-49916:}}Come, little ones! Whisper to me the secrets of the Green.
{{115740052-0-49917:}}Marius? You're with these … these … deserters?
{{115740052-0-51900:}}We'll see you at Hoperoot, friend!
{{115740052-0-51901:}}Maybe there's something with the Echos and that book. See if they have anything more to say.
{{115740052-0-49107:}}My love, the investigator returns. We'll continue our discussion later.
{{115740052-0-51919:}}Develop a keen mind.
{{115740052-0-50473:}}The missing totem and the shaman. It's all so horrid, but we should talk over what we found.
{{115740052-0-50472:}}Oh no, their shaman? Look at the wounds. Goblin weapons don't cause trauma like that.
{{115740052-0-50475:}}A rusty knife? It's not one of the Goblin's. See the handle? Much too big for them.
{{115740052-0-50474:}}Normally there's an incredible totem in this shrine. Where is it? Goblins never move their totems!
{{115740052-0-50350:}}Ah! Excellent! My notes on the Five Loyal Retainers. You know, it would do you well to study these notes—they might come in handy some day.
{{115740052-0-50352:}}Yes, well, my alliance with the Recollection was a bit … tenuous, at best.
{{115740052-0-50354:}}I can't believe they're complaining about me! Me! After all I did for them! Fine. Be that way.
{{115740052-0-48885:}}That's the forge. Ever notice that no matter how ancient, Daedric stuff never really changes? Anyway, dip Abolisher into the hot coals.
{{115740052-0-48884:}}You made it. I was worried one of those reality tears got you.
{{115740052-0-48886:}}Cracked acorns! Look at Abolisher! It surges with power again!
{{115740052-0-48881:}}This way, friend! Scruut told me to meet you here, but I wasn't expecting all the spirits!
{{115740052-0-48882:}}Those bolts of cloth! That must be the Mephala silk that Scruut wanted us to find.
{{115740052-0-48889:}}The Lamp of Clarity looks restored to me!
{{115740052-0-48888:}}The shrine of Azura! Hold the Lamp close and let's see if this works.
{{115740052-0-49282:}}This is Tham's place. I hope he's all right.
{{115740052-0-49283:}}Balandrus needs to pay for what he's done here.
{{115740052-0-49284:}}Look at these halls! It's just like the legend said. We're definitely in the right place.
{{115740052-0-49285:}}That's Tham's sword. I gave it to him so he could protect the tavern.
{{115740052-0-51007:}}Welcome to my little grotto! Drink it in, you've found the Netch. I hope I live up to expectations.
{{115740052-0-51006:}}It's settled, then? You should sort out the rest of this. I'll make my own way to Skingrad.
{{115740052-0-51005:}}Feel free to speak with the others, but join me in the study when you are ready.
{{115740052-0-51004:}}This must be some sort of joke!
{{115740052-0-51003:}}I'm sorry, is that … a riddle?
{{115740052-0-51002:}}Ugh, not again! Shoo! Go ahead, traveler. I'll be fine, I promise!
{{115740052-0-51001:}}Let us see what Mora took from me.
{{115740052-0-51000:}}Down there! Ithelia and her servants. They reached the well!
{{115740052-0-51009:}}You sound like my mother. I know enough magic to get by. It's just not my focus.
{{115740052-0-51008:}}Knight, you have an aptitude for magic. Perhaps you just have not found the right teacher ….
{{115740052-0-49628:}}Apply heat to liquify the harkfruit. Again, not too hot.
{{115740052-0-49427:}}Tribune? Thank the Divines! Are they gone?
{{115740052-0-51660:}}You're back! Good—I made some progress with the Hoperoot map. Let's talk.
{{115740052-0-51420:}}Quiet! I hear them—this way!
{{115740052-0-51423:}}Sergeant Luther?
{{115740052-0-51422:}}Legionary Luther, for your bravery, I hereby promote you to the rank of sergeant. Serve Skingrad well!
{{115740052-0-51346:}}Leramil? Friend, wha-wa-what's going on?
{{115740052-0-51348:}}These symbols represent our commitment to the village and to each other.
{{115740052-0-49207:}}I was so nervous when the captain handed me the payroll, I hid it in a barrel in the camp at the north end of the river.
{{115740052-0-51180:}}This way! This door leads out of the sunken ruins.
{{115740052-0-50524:}}Give it your all! I'll be here for the point at which you undoubtedly will need my consult.
{{115740052-0-50520:}}Ah, the Emblem at last! I've bested those Recollection fools!
{{115740052-0-49584:}}Come, proxy. Things here are more dire than I suspected.
{{115740052-0-50968:}}Even if your allies tell you the answers, you'll still need to complete the tasks yourself.
{{115740052-0-50961:}}I don't believe it! According to the Skein, Nantharion's back in Vashabar!
{{115740052-0-51709:}}Let's get back the Scholarium, and we can go over everything we've found.
{{115740052-0-51702:}}To whomever follows in my footsteps, I leave behind a transcribed copy of Mizbi's fable. This should help you on your quest.
{{115740052-0-51703:}}Look for the last of my notes in the remote holdfast of Paragon's Remembrance. And good luck with the Dragon.
{{115740052-0-51704:}}I knew I wasn't crazy about Mizbi. This is so interesting.
{{115740052-0-51705:}}Sounds like we're off to Paragon's Remembrance in Wrothgar. Allow me, adventurer.
{{115740052-0-51706:}}Not quite the welcome I was expecting. This place must have been very different back in Ulfsild's time.
{{115740052-0-51707:}}I'll guard your backside. Head in, and I'll be right behind you.
{{115740052-0-51579:}}By my sword, a legionary! Report, soldier.
{{115740052-0-51578:}}Back here, comrade. I found Captain Leronus.
{{115740052-0-51574:}}My fable, my story, ends where it began. Now go. And scribe your own.
{{115740052-0-49457:}}I trusted you! You … you ….
{{115740052-0-51541:}}All these defenses. Meant to protect … what?
{{115740052-0-49623:}}There's Betu! Quick, grab the will while he is occupied!
{{115740052-0-49678:}}Look at it, it's marvelous. Floating there, just waiting to be taken! Any final notes, assistant, before I commit history?
{{115740052-0-49677:}}We've lost so many to the traps. Had that fool warned us about them, Givvins would have never been petrified.
{{115740052-0-49676:}}Hurry, mortals. Ithelia and her scion have breached my private sanctum. Enter the Mythos and aid the One Who Knows.
{{115740052-0-49990:}}Place the Skein of Secrets near the reality tear.
{{115740052-0-49991:}}Now use the spell scroll to release the relic's energy.
{{115740052-0-49992:}}It actually worked!
{{115740052-0-49993:}}That's that last of the relics! I can feel reality healing and it feels glorious! Let's return to Beragon's and check in with Leramil.
{{115740052-0-49996:}}The gate's blocked by rubble. I think Abolisher might help us here.
{{115740052-0-49997:}}That's the balcony beyond the gate mentioned in the Recollection notes. Try Abolisher here.
{{115740052-0-49998:}}This must be the pit mentioned in the Recollection note. Can we use Abolisher here?
{{115740052-0-51857:}}I fought with everything I had. My wife was at home by herself. She told me she had news for me for when I returned. I needed to know what it was.
{{115740052-0-49334:}}We're trapped! Please, put out the flames! Hurry!
{{115740052-0-49335:}}Please! You can't leave me here!
{{115740052-0-49336:}}Thank you. We can find our way from here.
{{115740052-0-49337:}}Shut up, Grivier. Run back to your wife before I decide to tell her we were too late.
{{115740052-0-49330:}}You have my thanks, stranger. I can help him get to safety.
{{115740052-0-49331:}}Maerenah? Stranger, cut me free! She's one of those monsters!
{{115740052-0-49332:}}I'm the monster? After what you did? You better speak to him. Not sure I can guarantee I won't snap his neck if I get too close.
{{115740052-0-49333:}}Friend, we need to talk about this.
{{115740052-0-49339:}}Rosalyn mentioned explosives. Look for alchemical oil and combustion canisters.
{{115740052-0-51276:}}The knot isn't an object you can contain. Let us pass, Xoryn!
{{115740052-0-51277:}}The knot will listen to me. It is mine!
{{115740052-0-51088:}}The null arca is right over here! Bring the knot. Quickly now!
{{115740052-0-51087:}}I recognize this place. Mortals worshiped me here.
{{115740052-0-51086:}}You triggered something in the knot!
{{115740052-0-51085:}}This one knew it was unstable but …. You take it. You'll be faster.
{{115740052-0-51084:}}So this is what the arcane knot looks like.
{{115740052-0-51083:}}Excellent work, my friend. Let us speak.
{{115740052-0-51082:}}There's no mistake, Otho. I will help oversee the transfer of ownership. You and Betu will have all your needs seen to.
{{115740052-0-51081:}}I can't believe it. There must be some mistake.
{{115740052-0-51080:}}You have got to be joking, the dog?
{{115740052-0-49988:}}That was the last relic, right? Let's head back to my townhouse and meet up with the others.
{{115740052-0-50268:}}Why did we leave Hammerfell, Cirthan?
{{115740052-0-50269:}}You know why we left, my love.
{{115740052-0-51581:}}Now let's find a way out of here!
{{115740052-0-51586:}}It's not just about reclaiming what was lost. This is about our heritage!
{{115740052-0-49815:}}Grab that bucket of oil first.
{{115740052-0-49814:}}Tribune, get that ballista in working order. Mercenary, you get the fun part.
{{115740052-0-49817:}}Tribune, take lookout. Mercenary, finish repairing the ballista. The parts are by the back wall.
{{115740052-0-49811:}}Can you not see? Reality collapses around you as fate's threads unravel.
{{115740052-0-49810:}}You have become the very threat I foresaw, Ithelia.
{{115740052-0-49812:}}Stop Ithelia, proxy!
{{115740052-0-49819:}}That should hold them back. Now, crush those Daedra!
{{115740052-0-49818:}}That did it! Now arm that ballista, target the oil, and set it ablaze.
{{115740052-0-49352:}}Stay here, friend. Let her clear the gate!
{{115740052-0-49350:}}Over here! There's Hoperoot. Something isn't right. The sentries wouldn't let us in.
{{115740052-0-49351:}}Be ready. I'm going in!
{{115740052-0-49356:}}I'm here, comrade! I lost the sentries, but there's a damned Recollection army in here!
{{115740052-0-49357:}}Nantharion must be a prisoner in his own settlement. Keep your eyes open for any information about the Recollection's plans.
{{115740052-0-49355:}}And that's the plan. Get to the gate!
{{115740052-0-51159:}}I remember you, my friend. Don't worry. I've just been holding that in a long, long time.
{{115740052-0-50059:}}Nantharion betrayed all we hold sacred, Count Calantius. And he has paid for his crimes with his life.
{{115740052-0-50737:}}What's a jumped-up alligator got to do to get a drink around here?
{{115740052-0-50734:}}Lor-Emero! Parhaelia! Ballepelin! Yondvarla! And um … hang on, I don't know that last name. No, no, wait—
{{115740052-0-49744:}}Thanks! Even the plants want to kill me!
{{115740052-0-50789:}}How are the barracks crawling with Daedra?
{{115740052-0-50788:}}The courtyard is through those doors.
{{115740052-0-50255:}}Gods, Balandrus! What have you become? Friend, attack!
{{115740052-0-50254:}}Come back to join the slaughter, Maerenah?
{{115740052-0-50257:}}Stay alert. Just one clue from here will point us in the right direction.
{{115740052-0-50256:}}Told you there was a spare key. Now let's go down and open that vault.
{{115740052-0-50251:}}There appears to be a memory here. Use the Echonir.
{{115740052-0-50253:}}Balandrus is finished and the Terror is no more. I saw Tham run out when the battle started. Let's head outside.
{{115740052-0-50252:}}One bloodfiend den taken care of. There's probably one more. Let's go find it.
{{115740052-0-50259:}}Oh, yes, I can. Stop complaining and maybe you can free yourself before the vampires return.
{{115740052-0-51780:}}One last portal for you, my friend.
{{115740052-0-50840:}}Our future lies in whatever you decide. Do we have your support?
{{115740052-0-51782:}}I believe Ulfsild the Evergreen would have loved that.
{{115740052-0-51783:}}Vargas is shielded, comrade! Use Abolisher to destroy the portals!
{{115740052-0-51784:}}Defend me, Mirrormoor! Overwhelm our foes!
{{115740052-0-51785:}}You dare use Abolisher against me?
{{115740052-0-51786:}}I shall aid Hermaeus Mora while you try to stop Torvesard.
{{115740052-0-50841:}}I wonder what these ruins were? They're certainly older than the structures above.
{{115740052-0-51788:}}One moment, proxy.
{{115740052-0-50844:}}Otho, escort Pelena back to the manor. We will follow the dog!
{{115740052-0-50846:}}What have you got there, boy?
{{115740052-0-50847:}}Lady Weatherleah must have left that note before her death. We should show it to Aquilia.
{{115740052-0-50793:}}Stop buying things, sister!
{{115740052-0-49740:}}Thank you. I'm never coming back here.
{{115740052-0-49743:}}Help! The vines won't let me go!
{{115740052-0-49745:}}Head to the market overlook. We'll take stock of the situation there.
{{115740052-0-49747:}}Another tear! How many wounds can reality sustain?
{{115740052-0-49749:}}Damn, they breached the wall. Let's talk strategy, comrade.
{{115740052-0-49748:}}The light of the Lamp unveiled the way. Keep going, proxy.
{{115740052-0-51229:}}Drink up, friends! The next round is on me!
{{115740052-0-51469:}}That did it.
{{115740052-0-51460:}}The Recollection and those rogue Daedra are on the run, thanks to them!
{{115740052-0-51465:}}The remaining Scarlets. Good. All in one place … We'll … we'll see them all, soon.
{{115740052-0-51464:}}I yield!
{{115740052-0-49049:}}I think you've got this. Try not to run afoul of those necromancers. I'll meet you outside when you're finished.
{{115740052-0-49959:}}That did it! The vault is unlocked. We'd better go in before the Recollection notices.
{{115740052-0-49489:}}Proxy, stay close!
{{115740052-0-50974:}}That memory showed Shardborn fighting other Daedra. Ithelia was defending something in this place.
{{115740052-0-50975:}}Another memory? We might learn something. Go ahead. I'll watch for Vargas.
{{115740052-0-50976:}}Is this where Ithelia lost her ancient battle? Hmm. Her minions remained to guard the passage behind her.
{{115740052-0-51100:}}Now we know how to use Abolisher to close Mirrormoor portals!
{{115740052-0-51101:}}Hmm. Is this Vesper Valente really as special as it sounds?
{{115740052-0-51379:}}That's melted silver. This was where the house stood. One knocked-over candlestick, and this is all that's left.
{{115740052-0-51378:}}Headstones? They're in good condition. Someone has been maintaining them.
{{115740052-0-51371:}}Poor Livius! We didn't like each other, but no one deserves such a fate.
{{115740052-0-51734:}}I think we need the Lamp's light again.
{{115740052-0-51739:}}Loftily done. Nahlia, the next portal, if you please. To Borderwatch Ruins you go.
{{115740052-0-50874:}}Ah, the outsider. How goes your quest?
{{115740052-0-50544:}}I never sought this battle, but you leave me no choice.
{{115740052-0-50540:}}Look at all this mess! Ugh, the Recollection has no regard for proper excavation procedures. Elfbetta, my usual assistant, would be shocked by such disarray.
{{115740052-0-50543:}}You hold your own against me, now face a multitude!
{{115740052-0-50549:}}I will restore what was lost, mortal! I must!
{{115740052-0-49899:}}Almost there. Just a little farther and then we can ring the warning bell!
{{115740052-0-49898:}}We need to reach the north, south, and east sections of the fort to find the items.
{{115740052-0-49896:}}I don't think he'll survive.
{{115740052-0-49891:}}The captain won't send us back in there, will he?
{{115740052-0-49890:}}Thank you! I hope I remember all this in the morning because you're my new best friend. I love friends so much.
{{115740052-0-49893:}}Augh … bad. I can't stand.
{{115740052-0-49892:}}How's your leg?
{{115740052-0-51636:}}Excellent! The wards are nearby. Seek the key fragment. Walk the path.
{{115740052-0-51630:}}I made this lens so you might see the world as I do. The very warp and weft of magic laid out before me.
{{115740052-0-51631:}}A look through the lens will allow you to see impressions left behind by the Luminaries. Follow these signposts, and you will find their domains.
{{115740052-0-51632:}}Now enter the focal point and peer through the lens. You will see what was unseen in the fable.
{{115740052-0-51638:}}Gather your feathers about you. The last fragment is within those ruins.
{{115740052-0-51639:}}You've flown true, the Luminary Indrik's door is close. Find a path to the top, and take the next step on your journey.
{{115740052-0-49271:}}Maerenah, here?
{{115740052-0-49270:}}Miscarcand? That's where we'll find King Nantharion!
{{115740052-0-49273:}}Run, you bastards.
{{115740052-0-49272:}}We need to tell Balandrus!
{{115740052-0-49275:}}Damn vampires! Cowards, the lot of them! Look around. We need to find Tham or a clue as to what happened to him.
{{115740052-0-49274:}}Over here, friend! This legionary says this doorway just opened—and Tribune Alea's somewhere inside.
{{115740052-0-49277:}}Over here! Help! We're trapped!
{{115740052-0-49276:}}We'll meet you near Leftwheal, friend. If there's another seed there, we need to find it.
{{115740052-0-49279:}}Sutch doesn't deserve this horror.
{{115740052-0-50845:}}It seems Betu has brought us something.
{{115740052-0-50705:}}Oh, Mizzik! I didn't see you there. I believe I saw Betu heading south.
{{115740052-0-50704:}}There's Lady Pelena and her husband Uriel, our once long-lost son.
{{115740052-0-51353:}}Those bandits won't stick around once an experienced Legion cohort arrives!
{{115740052-0-51351:}}How long before reinforcements arrive, do you think?
{{115740052-0-51357:}}Yffre's bones! Fine!
{{115740052-0-51356:}}Agreed. You arse.
{{115740052-0-51355:}}We're done here.
{{115740052-0-51354:}}Someone's ringing the bell. Does that mean they made it?
{{115740052-0-49345:}}Friend, destroy the seed. We'll hold off the Recollection!
{{115740052-0-48953:}}I shall open a portal to Apocrypha. Once there, use the Skein and let us see if we can pick up Ithelia's trail.
{{115740052-0-48951:}}We have planned and prepared long enough. Now we must act.
{{115740052-0-48950:}}Welcome Master Bogvir. And guest. I'll escort you to Lord Valente. This way.
{{115740052-0-49346:}}You burned the seed? Good. One less threat to worry about.
{{115740052-0-49116:}}No, it was definitely intact before Lady Weatherleah's death.
{{115740052-0-49341:}}I'll live. Thanks, Beragon.
{{115740052-0-48966:}}Use the Skein and let us see if it can pick up Ithelia's trail.
{{115740052-0-48967:}}Another way to reach the Mythos, perhaps? Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum?
{{115740052-0-49558:}}Now, proxy! Use Abolisher to destroy the Loom!
{{115740052-0-49559:}}Arggh! My Loom! But the power! Such terrible power!
{{115740052-0-49550:}}Those vines. That's the entrance to the ruins.
{{115740052-0-49551:}}Thank you, friend! It was a nightmare. I was in a different world.
{{115740052-0-49552:}}I thought I was never going to get out of there!
{{115740052-0-49553:}}If there is no escape by the road Beragon followed, we must continue on. Lead the way, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49555:}}We must find our way to the Loom's core and destroy that infernal machine.
{{115740052-0-49556:}}Why, mortals? I do this for you. Vargas, protect the Loom!
{{115740052-0-49557:}}Vargas, no! Wait, I can set this right.
{{115740052-0-50870:}}Go, my Prince! You must escape!
{{115740052-0-49965:}}Here, comrade. This is the spot Scruut indicated.
{{115740052-0-49967:}}Now use the spell scroll Scruut provided to release the Lamp's energy!
{{115740052-0-49966:}}I'll never get used to those tears in the air. Place the Lamp of Clarity beneath it.
{{115740052-0-49969:}}I think it worked, comrade!
{{115740052-0-49968:}}Look! The tear! It's closing!
{{115740052-0-51052:}}I came as quickly as Scruut's trinket allowed. I want to help, however I can. Let me accompany you.
{{115740052-0-51053:}}I … of course. Let us make haste, proxy.
{{115740052-0-51054:}}You're too late, pest! Prepare for the inevitable!
{{115740052-0-51055:}}Xoryn, do not unleash that creature!
{{115740052-0-51057:}}Fate has demanded I assist its proxy. It is why I am here.
{{115740052-0-49456:}}Rest easy, friend.
{{115740052-0-49453:}}There are many hidden paths between the planes. I suspect the Skein of Secrets has showed us one. Prepare yourselves.
{{115740052-0-49452:}}Is that one of those tears in reality Scruut spoke about? I'd keep my distance from it if I were you.
{{115740052-0-49459:}}Ruri! You scheming bastard!
{{115740052-0-50991:}}Such a relief. And I'll be able to press and sort out your clothing in time for any balls or soirees.
{{115740052-0-50097:}}Mora dares? Damn his eyes, every one of them!
{{115740052-0-50096:}}Place the components and I'll add the spark.
{{115740052-0-50095:}}Those crates. That has to be one of the weapon stockpiles. Place the components and I'll do the rest.
{{115740052-0-50321:}}You did it, friend! But what's happening to Ithelia?
{{115740052-0-50320:}}It is done. The Loom is shattered beyond repair. I'll summon a portal to leave this place.
{{115740052-0-50323:}}Now? We go home. What happened here will be the stuff of legend. I can't wait to tell the tale!
{{115740052-0-50325:}}Now I can undo my long imprisonment. Make it so I was never forgotten.
{{115740052-0-50326:}}I can find a path in which the Princes and I were never in conflict. And with the Loom I shall weave it into this reality!
{{115740052-0-51902:}}You have potential. But you do not understand yet.
{{115740052-0-51903:}}I will bring your murderer to justice, father. This I swear.
{{115740052-0-49118:}}Mizzik has seen enough.
{{115740052-0-51439:}}Another portal! Slay those Daedra and charge Abolisher!
{{115740052-0-51432:}}I will. We will! I promise.
{{115740052-0-51433:}}Ulfsild left behind the sigil, your sigil. She had a long, happy life after the Scholarium, Crow.
{{115740052-0-51430:}}As my life draws to a end, I've left a few things unsaid.
{{115740052-0-51436:}}I think … I think I'm going to stay on here. See what happens if we open the Scholarium to the world.
{{115740052-0-49256:}}Halt! King Nantharion sees no one without good cause.
{{115740052-0-50422:}}Sacred water, a blood vial, and a bottle of wine. Yes, that should be all of them. Let's head back to the altar and see what we can do.
{{115740052-0-50423:}}There's our altar. Note the three bowls. We need to put all three items on the altar, then anoint it with the proper liquid. Come, let's make haste in finding all of them.
{{115740052-0-50420:}}Here we are, the Sacred Water. Drawn from a spring in the very heart of an Ayleid sanctuary, I don't doubt.
{{115740052-0-50421:}}The contents of this bottle … they've been partially used? Have they been drinking on the job?
{{115740052-0-50426:}}Over there. What's on that stone table?
{{115740052-0-50427:}}That didn't work! Assistant, try another offering!
{{115740052-0-50428:}}That did it. Ahem…just as I predicted! A tribute to the wine shared between the Retainers upon their arrival. Good job following my instructions, assistant. I'll make an explorer of you yet!
{{115740052-0-49250:}}Friend, I'd like to say a few words about what we accomplished.
{{115740052-0-51771:}}With pleasure, my Prince.
{{115740052-0-51770:}}Keep draining Mora, scion. I will deal with his champions!
{{115740052-0-51773:}}Mortal, my scion has taken the power. You must stop Torvesard!
{{115740052-0-51775:}}The legendary Labyrinthian maze. I guess I should have noted the path from the invisible walkways. But I took the Fox's advice very seriously.
{{115740052-0-51774:}}Beragon, Scruut, Tribune Alea! Lend your might to fate's chosen!
{{115740052-0-51777:}}The Crow is a Luminary. She's just so different from the others. I wonder why.
{{115740052-0-51776:}}She called the blade Abolisher. It's all yours, comrade.
{{115740052-0-51779:}}Is that ward sustaining the orbs?
{{115740052-0-51778:}}My sister's trapped! We need help!
{{115740052-0-51376:}}Beautiful! But I'd bet that's a quick trip down.
{{115740052-0-51370:}}Oh no, Florentina! Why did they have to kill her?
{{115740052-0-51373:}}The gate just went up. You did it!
{{115740052-0-51372:}}Olcinius was a good soldier. I hope he took a few of them with him!
{{115740052-0-49665:}}Good. You cleared the corruption here, but I fear there may be more.
{{115740052-0-51174:}}There you are! Finally. I just want to talk.
{{115740052-0-49594:}}The gardener found <<1>>'s body? We should speak to him next.
{{115740052-0-50620:}}Hello? Is someone there? I need help.
{{115740052-0-50621:}}Bella? What is Octavius' niece doing here?
{{115740052-0-50198:}}They say Nantharion is dead. I … I don't know how I feel about that.
{{115740052-0-50199:}}He led us here under false pretenses and killed a lot of people. I know exactly how I feel.
{{115740052-0-50196:}}And did you hear? The Recollection worships some forgotten Daedric Prince. That's why we're seeing so many Daedra!
{{115740052-0-50195:}}I just heard the news. King Nantharion was killed, defeated by the Legion's mercenary!
{{115740052-0-51576:}}The gardens are just east of here, down the hill.
{{115740052-0-51575:}}Who, Gaius? Who attacked Rustwall?
{{115740052-0-51573:}}This horrid relic rose from the ground. I need to talk.
{{115740052-0-49627:}}There you are! Come here. I have an idea about the Sage's Dream.
{{115740052-0-49622:}}More tracks! The dog definitely went this way.
{{115740052-0-49620:}}I won't fight you, Beragon. There are other seeds than these.
{{115740052-0-49621:}}I'll go after her. Grab the seed and follow after me.
{{115740052-0-49629:}}You should chill the lute berries without freezing them.
{{115740052-0-51746:}}Thank the Singer that's over.
{{115740052-0-49347:}}They knew we were coming. Either the greenspeaker set us up, or there's a spy in Nantharion's court.
{{115740052-0-51230:}}You hear that, barkeep? I've got a new drinking buddy!
{{115740052-0-51807:}}Daedra on the left side. Stop them!
{{115740052-0-51800:}}Kill them, my Shardborn! Recover Abolisher!
{{115740052-0-49587:}}[Dog Barking]
{{115740052-0-49586:}}Mortal, help me. Please.
{{115740052-0-49585:}}Go where I cannot, proxy. Untangle this knot of fate.
{{115740052-0-50170:}}You're just going to take what's-his-name's word for it? The Elf who colludes with Imperials?
{{115740052-0-50171:}}Well, Greenspeaker Darolith believes Beragon.
{{115740052-0-50173:}}I'm not sure what to believe. Is there any evidence?
{{115740052-0-49183:}}You saved us! Please, you need to stop him.
{{115740052-0-49182:}}Looks like the effects are already subsiding.
{{115740052-0-49181:}}Mizzik can't believe it. Is this Lady Weatherleah's missing fortune? Let us investigate.
{{115740052-0-49180:}}And that should do it. You're free to administer the cure.
{{115740052-0-49187:}}You take the payroll and report back to the captain. I'll continue to ring the bell until help arrives.
{{115740052-0-49186:}}We made it! We actually made it!
{{115740052-0-49185:}}That's it. Let's get out of here.
{{115740052-0-49184:}}We need to destroy that laboratory. You scout ahead while I work on freeing these people. I'll meet you there.
{{115740052-0-48856:}}I'll join you. At a distance, of course. Wouldn't want Lazen thinking you mean him any harm.
{{115740052-0-48857:}}<Bark Bark>
{{115740052-0-48855:}}Care to earn some gold, adventurer? I could use a bit of assistance.
{{115740052-0-48851:}}Where's the Legion's gold? Tell me!
{{115740052-0-48858:}}Lazen, is that you?
{{115740052-0-48859:}}Oh, I'm so happy you're safe!
{{115740052-0-49450:}}Let's talk outside! Come on Lazen!
{{115740052-0-49395:}}By the Green! The wildburn seed destroyed Hoperoot.
{{115740052-0-49392:}}The wildburn seed! It released its energy when you destroyed it! Hoperoot is doomed!
{{115740052-0-49390:}}Great! Let's go back to the great welkynd stone and try it in one of the sockets.
{{115740052-0-49391:}}Something's wrong! It's too soon! The wildburn seed released its energy too early! Run!
{{115740052-0-49096:}}A note peeking out from behind the painting? Excellent eye for detail, friend.
{{115740052-0-51429:}}It's been years since my time in the Scholarium, but I realized I never left a final message behind.
{{115740052-0-51428:}}It's Ulfsild! But she looks older. Happier.
{{115740052-0-51425:}}What will I tell the Votary Commander? In … in the meantime let me get that portal to Eastmarch going.
{{115740052-0-51427:}}I don't see a sigil, but she did leave us an echo.
{{115740052-0-51426:}}You'll do just fine, knight. I will await both of you back at the altar.
{{115740052-0-51421:}}Locked! Big Urm, you know what to do. The rest of you, search for anything that might be of use!
{{115740052-0-50934:}}Ahh, at last.
{{115740052-0-50935:}}Ursilia, before we talk, let me see if I've got anything that will flush the wine from your system.
{{115740052-0-50938:}}Not now, Fennorian. I have more important matters.
{{115740052-0-50939:}}As I was saying, I'll compensate double wages for all who remain. With your expertise, we'll revive the traditional methods and be producing excellent wine in no time!
{{115740052-0-50886:}}Our initial investigations are complete, proxy. Let us speak.
{{115740052-0-50200:}}But we believed in him once. He inspired us!
{{115740052-0-51810:}}Daedra approaching on the right side. Protect the legionary!
{{115740052-0-51571:}}Umbolwe, tend their wounds! Giovanni, keep an eye on that horizon. Gods help me if we're taken by surprise here.
{{115740052-0-50356:}}Read this! They say I prattle. I don't prattle. I offer my wisdom, calmly and reasonably. They should've been grateful.
{{115740052-0-50816:}}The library is to the left. Your other left.
{{115740052-0-51490:}}Val … oh gods. Valenia!
{{115740052-0-51491:}}Friends, we should remember the Scarlets who aren't here. Before we go our separate ways again.
{{115740052-0-51492:}}I have places to be, but they can wait. I'll be there. And I won't be drinking.
{{115740052-0-51493:}}I agree. I wish we had come together before all this. Hooke?
{{115740052-0-51495:}}That was too close! Knives, tend to Val.
{{115740052-0-51496:}}She will live, but that wound is severe. I'm sorry, Val. That arm may never be the same.
{{115740052-0-51497:}}Hooke. If you're planning to escort Valenia to her family, I'd like to join you.
{{115740052-0-51142:}}Great! I've got my own way to get about, I'll see you at the next location.
{{115740052-0-51179:}}Almost there!
{{115740052-0-49091:}}There! Ithelia and Torvesard! But what have they done to Hermaeus Mora?
{{115740052-0-49092:}}Only a threat to you, Mora!
{{115740052-0-49098:}}Interesting. A hidden note guarded by a painted dog. What does it say?
{{115740052-0-49349:}}Hey, over here!
{{115740052-0-49348:}}A spy! Then the king is in danger! Friend, let's talk.
{{115740052-0-51175:}}You again! Stay away from me! Help! She's going to kill me!
{{115740052-0-51328:}}My inheritor could come from anywhere, from a distant era. A brighter time, I dare to hope.
{{115740052-0-50435:}}Do what you have to. But don't blame me, Pim.
{{115740052-0-50434:}}Keep your gold, Octavius. My friend and I are going to fix this!
{{115740052-0-50518:}}I did not take your totems, but I am returning them. So, please stop.
{{115740052-0-50516:}}Over here!
{{115740052-0-50517:}}Here they come. Don't attack them.
{{115740052-0-50514:}}Hermeaus Mora consumes this shrine. His response to the savagery of Ithelia's defense.
{{115740052-0-50515:}}You have to get the totems back. Nothing else will stop this violence.
{{115740052-0-50512:}}This Ithelia chose uncontrolled rage. It will consume every piece of this reality.
{{115740052-0-50510:}}This shrine appears old, decayed. What happened here?
{{115740052-0-50511:}}Have Mora's forces finally come? Then, I am finished.
{{115740052-0-51744:}}Now that we are together again, let us find an exit from this place.
{{115740052-0-51745:}}They won't give up the pod without a fight!
{{115740052-0-51747:}}There you are. I just got back myself.
{{115740052-0-51741:}}Be sure to thank Nahlia. And don't be a stranger, or I'll find an excuse to start wandering the Scholarium again.
{{115740052-0-51742:}}Those doors! Let's try there. We need to find that seed.
{{115740052-0-51743:}}The Lamp! Its power is … gone. At least we saved Tribune Alea.
{{115740052-0-50758:}}Kynareth bless me, I like these odds.
{{115740052-0-50759:}}After I win this, I can afford a new mount.
{{115740052-0-50756:}}Noraine needs to learn to hunt. You know it's time, Regomor.
{{115740052-0-50757:}}She will. But not from you.
{{115740052-0-50750:}}Oh, my love, how I miss you.
{{115740052-0-50751:}}You were taken much too soon.
{{115740052-0-50286:}}I am just glad that conditions at the ranch have improved.
{{115740052-0-50284:}}The news out of Skingrad is wonderful! The Recollection has been defeated!
{{115740052-0-50285:}}Even better, the count and the greenspeaker are talking. Peace with the Wood Elves would be an excellent thing.
{{115740052-0-50288:}}I hope so, Cirthan. I hope so.
{{115740052-0-51489:}}Thanks to you. And your new friend.
{{115740052-0-51488:}}It doesn't stop. I'll be hearing that rutting buzzing for days!
{{115740052-0-51151:}}Wow. It's cold in here. Let's be quick.
{{115740052-0-51153:}}Beragon's friend? For his sake, I will dispatch you quickly.
{{115740052-0-51599:}}You two go ahead. That report we found. I want to check on Feldagard Keep.
{{115740052-0-49712:}}I'm going on ahead, onward to discovery!
{{115740052-0-49711:}}Hush, assistant. Do you see that ahead? Is that one of the Recollection's own? Turned to stone?
{{115740052-0-49716:}}A cave? I don't see any Recollection. Why would they leave this path unguarded?
{{115740052-0-49717:}}The Recollection brings supplies to this gate. The sentries here are predictable. We might be able to slip by them. Or we could try the path to the north, although I don't know where that leads.
{{115740052-0-49714:}}We watched the false king enter the ruins but he sent his warriors against us. The tribune drove them back and went in after him!
{{115740052-0-49715:}}No, this cannot be my fate ….
{{115740052-0-49718:}}That's the main gate. Lots of Recollection there. No way we're getting through them without a fight.
{{115740052-0-49719:}}I am the heir of the Ayleids and the beloved of Ithelia! I will not be denied!
{{115740052-0-50057:}}Right. Lead the way, traveler. The door just down the hall here.
{{115740052-0-50055:}}Over here, my friend! We have more work to do!
{{115740052-0-48908:}}Ah, I can sense the power of flowing through the relics. Well done! Now, Scruut and I have an idea about how to proceed.
{{115740052-0-48909:}}This portal will take us to Fargrave.
{{115740052-0-50129:}}There is more work to be done at home. I must return. Arkay bless you, traveler!
{{115740052-0-50127:}}Arise, you sleeping dead! Walk among the living instead!
{{115740052-0-50126:}}Wretched mortals! I'm not finished!
{{115740052-0-50125:}}Suckle the teat of the blood-soaked ground! Return from the grave, my call will sound!
{{115740052-0-50124:}}What's happening? My work's not done!
{{115740052-0-51094:}}The path to the Loom is below us. I shall open a way down.
{{115740052-0-51095:}}Tribune Alea's trapped by that portal! Careful, no telling what might emerge!
{{115740052-0-51096:}}Abolisher's gathering energy from each foe you defeat.
{{115740052-0-51097:}}Abolisher is charged with power. Unleash it against the portal!
{{115740052-0-51911:}}Shardborn? What are they doing here?
{{115740052-0-51910:}}Over there! Try the key in that desk.
{{115740052-0-51913:}}No, I cannot be undone by a mortal!
{{115740052-0-51912:}}I am the Unweaver! I am the Dark Tomorrow! I am the last path you will ever walk!
{{115740052-0-51915:}}Oh, good heavens! I say!
{{115740052-0-51914:}}<The sound of feathered wings.>
{{115740052-0-51916:}}Despite it all, it seems we are fated to battle. Face me, mortal!
{{115740052-0-49695:}}Abolisher will be mine again, mortals! We shall definitely meet again!
{{115740052-0-49694:}}More! I need more warriors!
{{115740052-0-49699:}}Agree to sign the confession, Yabren. My patience won't last forever.
{{115740052-0-49522:}}Hmm. I am not sure how to proceed and we have no time to wander aimlessly. Perhaps the Skein of Secrets can show us the way?
{{115740052-0-49525:}}Proxy, look! Another memory. Use the Echonir.
{{115740052-0-49527:}}My Loom of the Untraveled Road fills this place. From its core, I can break the shackles of fate. Undo mistakes. Unlock possibilities. Create new histories.
{{115740052-0-49526:}}Is this another, isolated section of Fargrave, or a pocket dimension within the demiplane?
{{115740052-0-49529:}}A threat? This is a gift. The gift of unconstrained choice.
{{115740052-0-49528:}}It's magnificent! But won't some Princes see it as a threat?
{{115740052-0-49499:}}I hope Beragon doesn't get bored and decide to follow us. He really wanted to explore these ruins.
{{115740052-0-49498:}}Is that a reality tear? It looks as dangerous as Scruut described.
{{115740052-0-49495:}}Agreed. We'll meet you there.
{{115740052-0-49496:}}You're safe now. Go join your family.
{{115740052-0-50829:}}Good boy, Betu! Our killer may very well have fled through this door.
{{115740052-0-50826:}}This scrap of fabric seems to have been torn from an expensive dress.
{{115740052-0-50824:}}Nonsense. It's clear Edric was a troubled man who killed Lady Weatherleah and took his own life.
{{115740052-0-50825:}}Maybe so, but I'm not leaving this room just yet.
{{115740052-0-50823:}}There's been another murder? The killer could come for any one of us next!
{{115740052-0-50820:}}The library exterior is just around the corner.
{{115740052-0-50821:}}Betu? What is he sniffing?
{{115740052-0-50358:}}The wildburn was not kind to this place. Let's locate the shrine, but remain vigilant.
{{115740052-0-50357:}}The first key fragment is yours. Well done!
{{115740052-0-48887:}}Over here, comrade! Perhaps you can make sense of what the Watchling told me.
{{115740052-0-49287:}}I knew Tham would get word to me. Don't like the way he ended it, but I know exactly where to find the best vintage.
{{115740052-0-49288:}}Tribune Alea! You're safe.
{{115740052-0-51647:}}Pirsisa, do we have more water for the wounded?
{{115740052-0-51649:}}There you are! I wanted to introduce you. This is Chronicler Firandil.
{{115740052-0-51648:}}This one will look. But it's doubtful.
{{115740052-0-49226:}}Mortal! The Great Eye requires one last task before your contract expires—along with everything else!
{{115740052-0-49227:}}Welcome to my townhouse, friends! I can't wait to hear the results of your investigations.
{{115740052-0-49225:}}Let us review what we saw in the ruins, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49020:}}I had dreams of being a great warden, you know.
{{115740052-0-49021:}}But these woods have changed. The land doesn't sing to me anymore.
{{115740052-0-49022:}}Return the dowry to Grander if you wish. I'm leaving all this nonsense behind.
{{115740052-0-49027:}}Not now, Betu! Away with you!
{{115740052-0-49028:}}With the will secured, let us speak with Edric.
{{115740052-0-49029:}}Just like at the Loom, Mora could not portal us closer to the energy now contained in Ithelia. But look what her very presence does to Apocrypha! We must hurry.
{{115740052-0-49798:}}Remain calm, Lady Sowerra! Perhaps that's enough fire for now.
{{115740052-0-49799:}}Time for a rest, friends. No need to push ourselves too hard now.
{{115740052-0-50419:}}I have my own theories as to why such ancient blood would be fresh. Alas. the Recollection had no interest in my musings.
{{115740052-0-50418:}}We're above the gate, but no sign of Beragon. What's he up to?
{{115740052-0-50413:}}Of course you do, but I don't care. Just talk to your friend and deal with my husband.
{{115740052-0-50417:}}Now we know why Nantharion needed a living fortress! Let's find that throne room!
{{115740052-0-50415:}}A Goblin just attacked me, Pim! My niece is missing. I'm hiring the hunters!
{{115740052-0-50414:}}All right, if you say so ….
{{115740052-0-49124:}}Betu found a key? And look, it seems Betu wants us to follow him.
{{115740052-0-51838:}}An illusion? It seems distorted.
{{115740052-0-49122:}}Ah, there you are! I have been expecting you.
{{115740052-0-51582:}}Traveler! Do you know what happened to the cohort at Rustwall?
{{115740052-0-51583:}}Focus! We cannot afford to falter!
{{115740052-0-49646:}}It has to work, Scruut. There are no other options. Ah, here comes our—proxy, where is Gadayn?
{{115740052-0-51587:}}Soon Dawnwood will spread and drive out those Colovian bastards.
{{115740052-0-51584:}}Shardborn, protect the portal!
{{115740052-0-49647:}}It is done. The remaining necromantic energy will dissipate on its own. Meet me outside this cursed place.
{{115740052-0-51585:}}Fight on, champions of Mirrormoor!
{{115740052-0-49485:}}You dare trespass in Mirrormoor? In the very heart of our power?
{{115740052-0-49480:}}That door, proxy. I believe that is our way forward.
{{115740052-0-51213:}}Not you again! You were with her. She sent you to kill me. I won't let you!
{{115740052-0-51216:}}Fear keeps us alive. You were doing your best. But let's work together from now on.
{{115740052-0-51217:}}Oh, my heart's racing! I don't like this place. Please, speak with me for a moment.
{{115740052-0-51214:}}It's all right, darling. I'm here now, you don't have to run anymore.
{{115740052-0-51215:}}I was so scared. I didn't think the fear would ever end.
{{115740052-0-51218:}}There you are, darling. Let me share your burdens.
{{115740052-0-51219:}}Please, I don't want to be alone anymore.
{{115740052-0-49619:}}Sorilen, talk to me! I can't let you take that seed.
{{115740052-0-49618:}}You're with the Recollection? Cracked acorns, what are you thinking? Follow her!
{{115740052-0-49617:}}Join me, Beragon. The Recollection needs Wood Elves like you. We can finally claim our rightful inheritance!
{{115740052-0-49616:}}Now she's up on the ledge!
{{115740052-0-49615:}}What? Sorilen, come back!
{{115740052-0-49614:}}I thought I could convince you. That we'd find the wildburn seed together.
{{115740052-0-49613:}}That's how it works, Sorilen. The new replaces the old.
{{115740052-0-49612:}}See, Beragon? The Colovians built atop our heritage! They buried it all!
{{115740052-0-49637:}}Step into the Many Paths once again, mortal.
{{115740052-0-49636:}}Step through. Let us see where this path takes us.
{{115740052-0-49933:}}Well, I just figured out where we need to go. But I am excited that this stranger wants to enter the debate now!
{{115740052-0-49930:}}Lost? How can we be lost? We make this trip every year.
{{115740052-0-49931:}}Give me a moment to get my bearings. This wouldn't have happened if we weren't debating all the time. It distracts me.
{{115740052-0-49937:}}Let's get moving, Agmund. If we're lucky, there'll be sweet rolls available at the bakery by the time we arrive.
{{115740052-0-49938:}}Oh thank the Eight. I was going to say the same thing, Isayas.\n\nBye, traveler! Thanks for the help!
{{115740052-0-50136:}}It's those Wood Elves! Valenwood is trying to annex territory that is rightfully ours!
{{115740052-0-50137:}}I'll handle things here. Shut those doors!
{{115740052-0-51842:}}I'll hang back, that blast took a lot out of me.
{{115740052-0-51840:}}Ugh … that wasn't the best idea I've ever had.
{{115740052-0-51847:}}This is the Scribing Altar. Make this Grimoire your own.
{{115740052-0-51846:}}If we are to quell this magic, we must focus it into a new creation. Place your hands on the altar.
{{115740052-0-51845:}}Why, stranger? Why? That was going to be my new pet!
{{115740052-0-51772:}}What … what did I see? Mortal, tell me what this means!
{{115740052-0-51266:}}Enough of your tricks! You can fix this by returning my wife to me!
{{115740052-0-51260:}}This prisoner is my responsibility. Let me deal with her, and I'll submit myself to your judgement.
{{115740052-0-50372:}}Can I offer you a glass of our new Vesper Valente?
{{115740052-0-50373:}}And here we are! The Emblem! But it is sealed away by magic. Surely these tiles, pressed in correct sequence, will remove the warding spells on it.
{{115740052-0-50370:}}Ahh. It's good to taste the ink of the Scholarium upon the air again.
{{115740052-0-50376:}}You're back! Tell me what you found.
{{115740052-0-50377:}}Look! There's a passage behind that rubble.
{{115740052-0-50374:}}Good, you found it. Place used to be crawling with Goblins. Let's see what's in here now.
{{115740052-0-50375:}}Certainly. I'm very curious about this wine.
{{115740052-0-50378:}}There's a key sitting on that desk. Take it and see if it unlocks any of the drawers.
{{115740052-0-50379:}}Hmm. Not for that desk? Then let's find the lock that key opens.
{{115740052-0-48869:}}There's the Blue Aedral! And a note, let's grab that.
{{115740052-0-48867:}}Good dog, Lazen!
{{115740052-0-48866:}}Sounds like he found more wine.
{{115740052-0-48865:}}Good dog! Look for another bottle, Lazen!
{{115740052-0-48864:}}There's another crate! Such a good boy, Lazen!
{{115740052-0-48863:}}Go on Lazen, find the rest of the missing Blue Aedral!
{{115740052-0-48861:}}Who's a brave boy? Who fights off bandits and monsters?
{{115740052-0-48860:}}<Bark>
{{115740052-0-51397:}}Sorry friends, we're almost there. Almost done.
{{115740052-0-51395:}}Off we go! Keep up, and eyes out for those wards!
{{115740052-0-51394:}}We're done with the first half, yup! Get ready for part two!
{{115740052-0-51393:}}Thank Magnus, solid ground. Are we done?
{{115740052-0-51392:}}Nice! We should be able to make it to the next platform.
{{115740052-0-51391:}}Follow close and go quick! This is so fun!
{{115740052-0-51399:}}Caelum has Val! She's been taken!
{{115740052-0-51398:}}Aww, we made it. We were so high up, that was so much fun. You did great!
{{115740052-0-51021:}}Elic, my life's pride, I'm so sorry. Those things I said to you—I wish I could take it all back.
{{115740052-0-51020:}}My boy. I've much to say after coming so far. Just let me catch my breath.
{{115740052-0-51023:}}Shh, my boy. We're together now. That's all that matters.
{{115740052-0-51022:}}I know, Dad. I'm sorry I didn't give you the chance to make amends.
{{115740052-0-51025:}}Like them!
{{115740052-0-51027:}}Good question. But the threads of fate connected to that mortal are shredded. We should talk to him.
{{115740052-0-51026:}}Scruut, where is this instability you detected?
{{115740052-0-51029:}}That barrier is cutting off a section I wanted to search for the knot.
{{115740052-0-49408:}}Look! I think that's another hidden welkynd stone. Use the Lamp, friend.
{{115740052-0-49409:}}I think there's another stone nearby. Try the Lamp here.
{{115740052-0-49404:}}You're here! Tribune Alea and I were just comparing notes. Let's talk, friend.
{{115740052-0-49405:}}Look! The stone you placed is feeding the greater welkynd. Let's find the rest of the lesser stones.
{{115740052-0-49402:}}Amazing! That stone wasn't there until the light of the Lamp revealed it.
{{115740052-0-49400:}}The servants are hiding in the catacombs. Let's talk.
{{115740052-0-49401:}}That strange glow. Is the Lamp doing that?
{{115740052-0-49873:}}There! The maze is below. The way to Elenglynn's shrine lies through the heart of the maze.
{{115740052-0-49872:}}Welkynd stones? Ayleids were fascinated with the magic of light, but this is not what we seek. Let us press on.
{{115740052-0-49871:}}The Recollection made it this far, but they have met some of Elenglynn's dangers.
{{115740052-0-49879:}}Oh. Oh ooo. Traveler, can you stop? I'm very lost. And a bit woozy.
{{115740052-0-49340:}}Tribune Alea, look out!
{{115740052-0-49343:}}The Recollection ambushed us. Like they knew we were coming.
{{115740052-0-49342:}}Are you hurt?
{{115740052-0-50721:}}How foolish of you to think that I would just disappear.
{{115740052-0-50723:}}Edric's tankard. There seems to be a suspicious residue inside.
{{115740052-0-50492:}}I'll meet you on the west side of Gray's Hollow when you have the totems. Good luck!
{{115740052-0-51722:}}The portal! Destroy the anchors, comrade!
{{115740052-0-51720:}}Good timing, friend. Come, let's give the others some space.
{{115740052-0-51721:}}Legionary Caepio is right. We need to shut down that portal.
{{115740052-0-51726:}}Troll! That's a big troll!
{{115740052-0-51727:}}Let's find Sorilen first, friend.
{{115740052-0-51724:}}Keep your ears open. Follow any shouts for help.
{{115740052-0-51725:}}I don't see Greenspeaker Sorilen. Wait. A body on the ground. They're wearing Recollection gear. Grab that note.
{{115740052-0-51728:}}I knew it. The place is thick with the Recollection.
{{115740052-0-51729:}}You're right. These ruins are incredible!
{{115740052-0-50236:}}It can't be as important as my news! They threw a celebration for the hero of West Weald!
{{115740052-0-50235:}}Am I forgetting something? It feels like I'm forgetting something.
{{115740052-0-51455:}}That's not what I heard. There's even a Wood Elf and a legionary working with an adventurer to stop the Recollection.
{{115740052-0-51450:}}Enough of this!
{{115740052-0-51451:}}Valenia!
{{115740052-0-51187:}}I created my scions to save me from a fate I finally accepted, though I had forgotten until you reminded me.
{{115740052-0-49058:}}Strange. Betu doesn't seem too fond of you, cousin.
{{115740052-0-49053:}}Farewell, adventurer. Perhaps one day we'll cross paths again.
{{115740052-0-51520:}}Watch out!
{{115740052-0-51298:}}When will I learn not to float casually into strange portals?
{{115740052-0-51299:}}For Skingrad! For West Weald! For Nirn!
{{115740052-0-51292:}}Warriors of Mirrormoor, stand fast against Mora's minions!
{{115740052-0-51290:}}Up there! It's Shardmarshal Vargas!
{{115740052-0-51296:}}I don't need payment to kill you.
{{115740052-0-51297:}}I'm here, my friends!
{{115740052-0-51567:}}Very well. You are both free to go.
{{115740052-0-50790:}}Ballista storage. See that lift? It brings them up into the courtyard.
{{115740052-0-50791:}}We're near the armory. Let's hope they haven't found it.
{{115740052-0-50792:}}The armory's just through those doors. Be ready for anything.
{{115740052-0-50795:}}You're impossible! Though a hot meal might be nice.
{{115740052-0-50796:}}Mother gave us coin. We should use it!
{{115740052-0-50797:}}Fine! But we need to eat.
{{115740052-0-51442:}}Abolisher is charged! Strike the portal!
{{115740052-0-51887:}}Reality in this path is extremely fragile. It might shatter. Hurry.
{{115740052-0-51886:}}My Shardborn. They always served me well.
{{115740052-0-51885:}}These shelves were full in our reality. Not ransacked like this.
{{115740052-0-51883:}}We need a way out. Try to use the blade the way Vargas did.
{{115740052-0-51882:}}Let's deal with these Shardborn, comrade. Don't let them recover the sword.
{{115740052-0-51881:}}As you command, Shardmarshal Vargas.
{{115740052-0-51889:}}And you're off like a racing frog! Let me know if you want to confer about the directions in the fable.
{{115740052-0-51888:}}I remember this as a place filled with light and joy. This is not that place.
{{115740052-0-50969:}}Your wisdom and wit have proven your worth. Accept the power of the Dragon, mortal. And may you prove clever enough in its use.
{{115740052-0-50967:}}These halls go on forever. We need to keep searching.
{{115740052-0-50966:}}Why are they just waiting around? What are they guarding?
{{115740052-0-50965:}}More Shardborn and Recollection ahead.
{{115740052-0-50964:}}This place is crawling with Recollection and fallen legionaries. I hope Tribune Alea is all right.
{{115740052-0-49318:}}Proxy. I hoped to find you here. I sensed a powerful ripple in fate, and came as quickly as I could.
{{115740052-0-49319:}}Stay back! Wait—Maerenah? You're with those bloodsuckers?
{{115740052-0-49314:}}I am whole! Come, Vargas. It is time to go home. With the Loom I will restore all that was lost.
{{115740052-0-50960:}}Well, that takes care of two more seeds. Let's talk outside.
{{115740052-0-49312:}}Ithelia! Unweaver, Mistress of the Many Paths, let your glory be restored!
{{115740052-0-49313:}}Remember your true self and free us from the chains of fate!
{{115740052-0-49310:}}With the well, I will empower the staff—and restore the memory of my Prince! Now be still!
{{115740052-0-49311:}}The Staff of Many Paths was never meant for mortal hands. Witness its true power!
{{115740052-0-51111:}}What's happen—
{{115740052-0-51113:}}A reality tear? How fortuitous. Let this be the end of fate's chosen!
{{115740052-0-50043:}}Come here, assistant. Let's take a better look at those documents.
{{115740052-0-51319:}}I sense something hidden here. Use the Lamp of Clarity, proxy … but carefully.
{{115740052-0-51316:}}Do you see the arches before us? I think they mark the doorway to next part of the Loom.
{{115740052-0-51315:}}Consider it done.
{{115740052-0-51314:}}Tribune Alea, will you escort the greenspeaker and the count home safely?
{{115740052-0-51313:}}Greenspeaker Darolith, Count Calantius. I'm afraid our friend has urgent business to take care of.
{{115740052-0-51310:}}The shard will finish you!
{{115740052-0-49158:}}Nobody leaves until Mizzik finds out what happened! Traveler, there's something by the body, quick.
{{115740052-0-49154:}}Not only a maze, but a tomb. Careful—the Ayleids were practitioners of necromancy.
{{115740052-0-49155:}}A locked gate? We must find the key, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49156:}}He's dead! Someone killed him!
{{115740052-0-49150:}}The residue on that teacup stinks with the same foul smell as the tainted tea we found with Edric's body.
{{115740052-0-49152:}}Mizzik would like to hear your thoughts on what we found.
{{115740052-0-49153:}}Mizzik heard a scream from down the hall! We must hurry!
{{115740052-0-49488:}}I banish you to the Many Paths, never to return!
{{115740052-0-51708:}}There you are! Those are her notes?
{{115740052-0-51164:}}Now the mushrooms. A few well-placed torches should ignite the entire harvest.
{{115740052-0-51165:}}Ah! His injuries are too much for him. Healer, help Sergeant Luther Lentinius recover and take him to the barracks.
{{115740052-0-51166:}}Count Calantius, Lord Svendalmor of the Burnt-Biscuits has been rescued, thanks to the bold efforts of this adventurer. I aided in their task.
{{115740052-0-50444:}}A ward of that power now binds it. Dispel the ward.
{{115740052-0-50445:}}I will see both of you in my domain, then. I will grant my promised power to the one that sought it. And offer safe harbor to the one that did not.
{{115740052-0-50443:}}Just as I said, my power overwhelms the fawn.
{{115740052-0-51108:}}I … I am glad it has been helpful. And that you still have it. More than I can say.
{{115740052-0-51109:}}Tears are opening up throughout the ruins. We barely made it here to warn you.
{{115740052-0-51106:}}Tread carefully, Gadayn. I prefer not to see any harm befall you.
{{115740052-0-51107:}}I still have the amulet you gave to keep me safe. I … I couldn't bear to part with it.
{{115740052-0-51104:}}Good, the gate to the Loom is still open.
{{115740052-0-51105:}}By the ancestors, look at this place! I remember when the walls of the Necropolis were my entire world ….
{{115740052-0-51102:}}Lord Valente is certainly proud of his new creation!
{{115740052-0-51103:}}Fargrave … it feels like my necropolis, a city of the dead.
{{115740052-0-49729:}}Why do you trouble my Prince, Ur-Daedra?
{{115740052-0-49728:}}Over there, friend. Isn't that an Echonir manifestation? We should see what it reveals.
{{115740052-0-49723:}}The Great Hall of Niryastare. This is as far as I got on my previous visit.
{{115740052-0-49722:}}There, friend! Those are the stairs we're looking for.
{{115740052-0-49727:}}So that's the Skein of Secrets? I wonder what it does. Go ahead and take it—we shouldn't linger here.
{{115740052-0-49726:}}Collapsed stairs? The Ayleids left us one last obstacle … but I think there's another chamber above. Try Abolisher again?
{{115740052-0-49724:}}The door to the south leads to Niryastare's vault, but it's sealed by this welkynd stone. Hmm. The Recollection's working on the puzzle. Let's look at their notes.
{{115740052-0-51325:}}This ritual has taken everything I had, and more. It worked, I think. And I will leave part of myself behind.
{{115740052-0-51322:}}The Recollection endures!
{{115740052-0-51323:}}Intruders? Don't let them reach the signal fires!
{{115740052-0-51320:}}The Lamp still functions—and it revealed a path. We should follow its guidance.
{{115740052-0-51321:}}Go on and find Tribune Alea. I'll catch up in a moment.
{{115740052-0-49101:}}Hermaeus Mora, you were right. I am a danger to fate and reality. Let me return what is rightfully yours.
{{115740052-0-49106:}}If Aquilia was Lady Weatherleah's last living heir, could she have expected to receive the missing fortune? A motive, perhaps?
{{115740052-0-49105:}}Fate's chosen has accomplished the tasks I set before them. Now let us enter the portal and conclude this heinous business. Your prison awaits, Ithelia.
{{115740052-0-49104:}}Poor Torvesard. Blinded by a compulsion I never should have bestowed.
{{115740052-0-49109:}}There you go, <<1>>! Baths aren't so bad.
{{115740052-0-49108:}}It seems Otho Florius found <<1>>'s body. We should be sure to speak with him and the Chef Edric as well.
{{115740052-0-49816:}}Now pour the oil around the barricades!
{{115740052-0-51809:}}You saved the legionary! We'll get him back inside.
{{115740052-0-51808:}}No! We lost a legionary.
{{115740052-0-51806:}}Commander, the ballista's destroyed! They'll breach the courtyard soon.
{{115740052-0-51802:}}That's far enough, baron!
{{115740052-0-50174:}}Go look at Hoperoot. There's your evidence!
{{115740052-0-49396:}}Hoperoot? A pretty name for an ugly secret.
{{115740052-0-50815:}}Of course, the scene of Lady Weatherleah's fall. Let us investigate the library.
{{115740052-0-50814:}}Got it. Let's get out of here.
{{115740052-0-50813:}}That's it, traveler! An Ayleid mosaic that represents me perfectly!
{{115740052-0-50812:}}They're drawn to remnants of the ritual, and they're likely to be territorial.
{{115740052-0-50811:}}Traveler! Be careful, bugs aplenty here.
{{115740052-0-50810:}}Now if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for the auction.
{{115740052-0-51048:}}I knew there was something wrong about you.
{{115740052-0-51042:}}Keshargo has searched but not found the arcane knot.
{{115740052-0-51044:}}Perhaps the ghost lights are the way out of this room. Go look.
{{115740052-0-51650:}}Good to meet you. Nahlia and I have been touring the library and I've already found … well. Some terribly surprising things!
{{115740052-0-51651:}}Firandil is a chronicler, one of the best the guild has to offer. You two talk a moment, and then we can discuss what comes next.
{{115740052-0-51656:}}Over here, mercenary! I bring another message.
{{115740052-0-51735:}}Wendir? Does that mean anything to you, Leramil?
{{115740052-0-51618:}}You'll burn the fruit. Reduce the heat!
{{115740052-0-51619:}}Harkfruit burns easily. Let's try again.
{{115740052-0-51616:}}That looks nicely steeped! Next, place the harkfruit in the apparatus.
{{115740052-0-51617:}}It needs to be hotter.
{{115740052-0-51614:}}Too hot! Reduce the heat.
{{115740052-0-51615:}}You burned that batch. We'll have to start over.
{{115740052-0-51612:}}First, place the tirum weed in the apparatus.
{{115740052-0-51613:}}Slowly apply heat to steep the tirum weed.
{{115740052-0-51611:}}Needs more heat.
{{115740052-0-49210:}}I was in this hall when the fort was attacked. I hid the communique in an ash pile in the fireplace before I joined the retreat.
{{115740052-0-50970:}}Comrade! You need to find a way to close that portal!
{{115740052-0-50955:}}Oh, thank the Divines, they're leaving. Please, can you help me out of this mess?
{{115740052-0-50513:}}We must leave this path before my reflection destroys it.
{{115740052-0-50728:}}Stendarr, give me the patience to wait out this misguided scoundrel.
{{115740052-0-50725:}}I wouldn't expect a deserter and a thief to understand the Legion's duties. Look after yourself, Hooke. You always have.
{{115740052-0-50724:}}So that's it, Corvus? People are dying, and you turn a blind eye because you're busy?
{{115740052-0-51458:}}Face the swarm, intruder!
{{115740052-0-51184:}}I wish the river would just carry me away.
{{115740052-0-51185:}}Sorilen wants to meet at the ruins east of here. Let's go.
{{115740052-0-51188:}}No, my Prince! I am Dremora! I am eternal! I will reform and complete the task you set before me.
{{115740052-0-51189:}}Such is the nature of Daedra. Never changing. Never growing. I return your power to you, Mora! And I disperse mine into the Void!
{{115740052-0-49059:}}There he is! My faithful friend … oh!
{{115740052-0-49051:}}I've taken what I need. Enough gold to start a new life, far away from here. You should do the same.
{{115740052-0-49050:}}He'd be right. I've tamed beasts and monsters. I've no need for a mouse.
{{115740052-0-49052:}}I'm not here to fight. My family drama put you in danger. I owe you some answers if you want them.
{{115740052-0-49055:}}Well, let's get this over with. Read it aloud, Mizzik.
{{115740052-0-49054:}}Oh gods. Haldain's really gone.
{{115740052-0-49057:}}Do not worry, Mizzik and his assistant will get to the bottom of this.
{{115740052-0-49056:}}Yes, of course. Weatherleah's walls hide a glittering secret. Safely guarded by four loyal paws.
{{115740052-0-51547:}}You're part of my army now, barkeep. Get used to it.
{{115740052-0-49675:}}I knew something was off about the Dark Elf expert. Sneaky-looking cur.
{{115740052-0-49674:}}Do not get any ideas. That dagger is tainted.
{{115740052-0-50963:}}I think someone's been down here. Let's see if we can find a wildburn seed.
{{115740052-0-50962:}}That poor beast has been corrupted by wildburn, but what's it doing here?
{{115740052-0-50681:}}Can we even trust him? I don't want to be labeled a suspect.
{{115740052-0-50682:}}Better to talk to an investigator than a gardener, Edric.
{{115740052-0-50683:}}Not a gardener, a friend. You'd do well to leave, Otho. And take Betu with you.
{{115740052-0-50680:}}Then talk to the investigator. Don't pull me into this.
{{115740052-0-50686:}}Oh gods! Did Haldain make it out?
{{115740052-0-50687:}}Quiet! We can worry about that later. If he's dead, I don't want to join him.
{{115740052-0-50684:}}Be mindful of where you point fingers, Edric.
{{115740052-0-50685:}}The lens shows you magic the way Ulfsild saw it, shades of how the Luminaries see it. Now, find the wards!
{{115740052-0-50688:}}Find two more wards to reveal the fragment.
{{115740052-0-50689:}}The wards are gone, and the fragment revealed!
{{115740052-0-51223:}}Ithelia has walked the path to her exile. Take Boethiah's blade and destroy the portal. Cut off the path so that she may never return.
{{115740052-0-51222:}}Oh, I feel so heavy all of a sudden.
{{115740052-0-51220:}}You won't be. Not ever again.
{{115740052-0-51227:}}The tears were not my creation, only an effect of my passing.
{{115740052-0-51226:}}As if Daedra weren't enough …. What was he thinking!
{{115740052-0-51225:}}An excellent portal, Mora. Now—
{{115740052-0-51224:}}Wait! We lost a … good friend to one of the reality tears. Is there anything …?
{{115740052-0-49132:}}Moons above! Is that Edric?
{{115740052-0-49909:}}A lingering memory? Use the Echonir, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49903:}}Here goes nothing! I command thee, lesser creature, to rise!
{{115740052-0-49901:}}But a portal to where?
{{115740052-0-49900:}}This is what the Skein wanted us to find. A portal recently used by Ithelia and reopened by Abolisher.
{{115740052-0-49906:}}Come. Tell me your thoughts, deputy.
{{115740052-0-49905:}}Does it matter? Wherever it leads, that's where we need to go.
{{115740052-0-49904:}}Oh no no! Get away! Why won't you obey me?!
{{115740052-0-51228:}}All I can offer is this wisdom to ease your mind.
{{115740052-0-49570:}}Do you feel it, Beragon? The grandeur of our history?
{{115740052-0-49575:}}And be wary of the tharriker. They aren't to be trifled with.
{{115740052-0-49381:}}I heard everything. Get to the throne room. I'll circle around and hit them from the back!
{{115740052-0-49384:}}I leave the Staff of Many Paths in your care, Nantharion. Use it well—bah! Your tree has pests!
{{115740052-0-50348:}}Caepio said the Daedric portal was to the east.
{{115740052-0-50343:}}That Wood Elf, he's with the Recollection. And he's taking orders from a Dremora? What's going on here?
{{115740052-0-50342:}}Move out! We need to find my cohort.
{{115740052-0-50341:}}There. That's the statue marked on the map. Search for the hidden key.
{{115740052-0-50340:}}These insects, they're from deep underground. What drove them to the surface?
{{115740052-0-50345:}}Down into the ruins! We've got to close that portal.
{{115740052-0-51694:}}This way, tribune! Follow the tracks!
{{115740052-0-51692:}}As you say, Shardmarshal Vargas. We have more than enough weapons now.
{{115740052-0-49291:}}Safe? We were pinned between a Daedra-spewing portal and a blocked passage before you came along.
{{115740052-0-49297:}}Look! Didn't we see something like that in Hoperoot? Use the Echonir.
{{115740052-0-49298:}}All right. Let's talk this through.
{{115740052-0-49437:}}Over here, comrade. Let's talk.
{{115740052-0-49435:}}Damn these mortals! Retreat!
{{115740052-0-49434:}}Defend the anchors! Maintain the portal!
{{115740052-0-49432:}}Still no sign of the escaped legionary, shardmarshal.
{{115740052-0-49597:}}[Aquilia Screaming]
{{115740052-0-51418:}}Are you certain you aren't smelling your own breath, Knives?
{{115740052-0-51419:}}We'll guard this passage and fend off any Daedra.
{{115740052-0-50996:}}Marcien, my friend, there's nothing to forgive. I'm the one who should be sorry for sending you out on such a dangerous job.
{{115740052-0-50997:}}It's fine, especially thanks to our friend here. I'm glad your pets arrived safe and sound. Although, um, shouldn't they be inside the cages?
{{115740052-0-50995:}}Sariyaah! I'm so sorry for disappearing, I know how you worry. Can you forgive me?
{{115740052-0-50998:}}Your foes destroyed your seeds, but do not fear. My very presence has awakened the well.
{{115740052-0-50999:}}Then draw power from the well, my Prince. You will be restored and I will create a wildburn that transforms the Weald!
{{115740052-0-51719:}}That's Vargas! Looks like she's in command of these Recollection.
{{115740052-0-51718:}}Look, down there!
{{115740052-0-51713:}}Beragon! Damn. He's charging ahead without us!
{{115740052-0-51712:}}How big is this place? You could hide half of Tamriel down here!
{{115740052-0-51710:}}You return! Carrying a riddle for me, I hope.
{{115740052-0-51717:}}Oh Great and Glorious Netch! Your cleverness exceeds us. We beseech your aid in finding your true fable. Guide us to your netchy bosom. Make our lofty dreams come true!
{{115740052-0-51716:}}Look! An anomaly like the one we observed at Wendir. We must try Abolisher, no matter the risk.
{{115740052-0-51714:}}A strange story, but Mizzik has encountered many strange truths. We must speak with the others.
{{115740052-0-49012:}}We'll never surrender this fort!
{{115740052-0-50770:}}We'll have so much fun together! I just have to catch you first.
{{115740052-0-50771:}}I'll get you something tasty. What do prairie dogs eat again? Meat?
{{115740052-0-49908:}}Perhaps I'll try this experiment again in the future, after I learn a bit more.
{{115740052-0-52143:}}Augh!
{{115740052-0-51483:}}What? No!
{{115740052-0-51486:}}So … all the Scarlets have come. Good. We'll all burn here … as they did.
{{115740052-0-51484:}}Argh!
{{115740052-0-50925:}}I suggest you speak to whoever you wish before entering the portal. Just in the unlikely event that you never return.
{{115740052-0-51154:}}The ritual! I cannot allow you to interfere!
{{115740052-0-51156:}}Hey, you made it! Gryphon, this is the new friend I was telling you about. They're going to help you out!
{{115740052-0-51150:}}Find the big cat by the water, and I bet that page will still be there. I believe in you!
{{115740052-0-51152:}}And dig dig dig. Here you go!
{{115740052-0-49982:}}Here, friend! This is the cave Scruut indicated.
{{115740052-0-49987:}}I much prefer the space above me to be hole free! Go finish the task and I'll see you back in Skingrad.
{{115740052-0-49986:}}I think that did it!
{{115740052-0-49985:}}Now use Scruut's spell scroll!
{{115740052-0-49327:}}There, tracks! Take a closer look.
{{115740052-0-49326:}}Clothing. Must have been torn in a struggle. Careful, I think we're close.
{{115740052-0-49325:}}Mining gear. Discarded to lose weight, I'd guess. Looks like they started veering west here.
{{115740052-0-49324:}}What's that on the ground ahead?
{{115740052-0-49323:}}That pack. Check it out while I keep watch.
{{115740052-0-49322:}}Definitely fresh. And they head southwest.
{{115740052-0-49321:}}We'll kill Balandrus and put an end to this. You have my word. And we'll find your husband. Let's go.
{{115740052-0-49320:}}I'm not with them. Not anymore. My friend will explain while I keep watch.
{{115740052-0-49329:}}Damn Grivier and his cowardly eyes! We need to talk.
{{115740052-0-49328:}}Someone took out these bloodfiends. And look. What's that paper?
{{115740052-0-51559:}}Daedra keep pouring through! Get ready to use Abolisher!
{{115740052-0-50551:}}Enough! Witness the combined power of the Fate-Changer and the Master of Fate!
{{115740052-0-51558:}}A Mirrormoor portal! Ready Abolisher!
{{115740052-0-50223:}}Maybe a real peace with Skingrad is possible now. A friendship, even.
{{115740052-0-50039:}}Mortal, Hermaeus Mora demands an audience when you finish talking to your allies. This portal will take you to him.
{{115740052-0-50031:}}These crystals definitely signal Ithelia's presence. See where they lead, proxy.
{{115740052-0-50035:}}Someone attacked the servant this belonged to.
{{115740052-0-50037:}}The captain planned to hide. But where?
{{115740052-0-50036:}}Servants light this when there's danger. To warn others away.
{{115740052-0-51452:}}Maybe, but the Wood Elves of Vashabar claim their intentions are peaceful.
{{115740052-0-51072:}}I will have this power!
{{115740052-0-51073:}}After this, no one will stop me.
{{115740052-0-51071:}}The arcane knot is mine to claim!
{{115740052-0-51077:}}Pelena, is it true? After everything my aunt did for you?
{{115740052-0-51074:}}This looks very steep. You go on ahead. Keshargo will take his time.
{{115740052-0-51078:}}I don't owe you an explanation, Aquilia.
{{115740052-0-51079:}}Turn up the flame valves as high as they'll go. I'll get rid of these research notes.
{{115740052-0-51155:}}My pets! So be it—I'll kill you myself!
{{115740052-0-49821:}}Get down there and find out where they're coming from!
{{115740052-0-49822:}}That's one of the items the captain sent us for. Let's keep going!
{{115740052-0-49823:}}I'm glad I remembered where I stashed that. Only one thing left to find!
{{115740052-0-49824:}}Now that we have the sequence, the key, and the payroll, we need to reach the bell tower! It's on the west side of the fort.
{{115740052-0-51158:}}Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy! It's me! Remember? The Fox!
{{115740052-0-51258:}}Calm yourself, Elelorn!
{{115740052-0-51362:}}Keep safe, everyone. May the Divines watch over us.
{{115740052-0-51363:}}Look! Here comes the adventurer the captain hired! But where's Calvo?
{{115740052-0-51360:}}Leaving? I'll find you when you get back. Don't take long.
{{115740052-0-51366:}}I think someone's been using this grate to get in and out, but it's locked from the inside. Might lead to the cellar of the house.
{{115740052-0-51367:}}Calvo's a true legionary!
{{115740052-0-51364:}}Calvo is ringing the bell?
{{115740052-0-51365:}}The flames are gone. We're reset.
{{115740052-0-51051:}}Gadayn? I—I did not expect you so soon.
{{115740052-0-50260:}}Balandrus doesn't need you anymore, Maerenah. You've been replaced.
{{115740052-0-50261:}}Tham the barkeep will be a much better vampire than you ever were.
{{115740052-0-50262:}}The bastards turned Tham? Hurry, I hear more bloodfiends. Place the combustion canister and stand clear.
{{115740052-0-50263:}}Here we go.
{{115740052-0-50264:}}It's happening again! Brace yourself!
{{115740052-0-50265:}}That blast re-awakened some latent magic in here. Look around while I get this thing under control.
{{115740052-0-51793:}}All right, you old arse. The village has spoken so let's make the best of this.
{{115740052-0-51797:}}Fetid bones! Look out!
{{115740052-0-51795:}}What's going on here?
{{115740052-0-51794:}}I suppose you're right, you bastard. If we're going to be kin, let's get to drinking like it.
{{115740052-0-51798:}}Blasted wretch, have mercy!
{{115740052-0-51135:}}Hey, wait! Don't be scared. I'm a friend! I think.
{{115740052-0-51134:}}The Recollection … is endless!
{{115740052-0-51133:}}You can't stop us. And you can't stop the wildburn!
{{115740052-0-51131:}}I heard Lord Valente and his new bride loathe each other.
{{115740052-0-51130:}}Mourn later. We must get this fragment back to the others.
{{115740052-0-49774:}}All right, so I will juggle like this. Looking good!
{{115740052-0-49775:}}Perhaps I'll ask about the portal later. Right now I want to know if the keep is secure.
{{115740052-0-49776:}}This dance took many weeks to master. Isn't it stunning?
{{115740052-0-49777:}}Another dead end. Use the Lamp and find us a path.
{{115740052-0-49770:}}No, no, no! We must get this right before our performance!
{{115740052-0-49771:}}I'm all right, tribune. You stopped Nantharion from unleashing that final wildburn on the Weald. Thank you, my friend.
{{115740052-0-49772:}}We stopped one threat, but did you see? Ithelia … changed.
{{115740052-0-49773:}}Let's talk about this back in Skingrad, friends.
{{115740052-0-49778:}}Clarity's light reveals the unseen. Let us continue.
{{115740052-0-49779:}}Sir Klauser, show us your fabulous acting ability!
{{115740052-0-51920:}}Stay buoyant and breezy.
{{115740052-0-51341:}}Leramil, I summoned fate's chosen. Why are you here?
{{115740052-0-51342:}}Pardon the impertinence, but we have done everything you asked. Now I have a request, Prince of Fate. Help me understand what Ithelia showed me.
{{115740052-0-51343:}}Ah, the Many Paths. You seek the return of the mortal, Gadayn. It is within my power to do this for a loyal servant, but there will be a cost.
{{115740052-0-51344:}}It is done. One day, Leramil, you who are called the Wise, I shall claim my due for this little boon. Be prepared to pay the cost at that time.
{{115740052-0-51345:}}Gadayn! The One Who Knows spoke true!
{{115740052-0-50344:}}This furniture was meant for the comfort of dignitaries who took refuge here, not for these Recollection bastards.
{{115740052-0-51696:}}Sunnamere. I wonder what it means? I never gave it a second thought before.
{{115740052-0-51697:}}That's right. This portal closed once I brought the others through.
{{115740052-0-51698:}}That Ulfsild echo is still quiet. Is there anything else hidden around here?
{{115740052-0-50553:}}Did you know that Wendir means journey in Ayleid? It could mean a journey into the afterlife, or some other destination for the ancient elves. It's amazing what you can learn from me, eh?
{{115740052-0-50556:}}Enter the portal, proxy!
{{115740052-0-50557:}}Isn't this nice, assistant? You get to walk through a ruin like this with none other than myself, Narsis Dren, as your guide.
{{115740052-0-49292:}}These legionaries need help. Go on ahead. I'll do what I can for them.
{{115740052-0-50579:}}Seems everyone left in a hurry. Take a look around.
{{115740052-0-51627:}}That's the exact amount of lute berries we need.
{{115740052-0-51625:}}That's the perfect amount of tirum weed. Don't add anymore.
{{115740052-0-51623:}}Ah, we froze the lute berries. We can start over.
{{115740052-0-51622:}}It's getting too cold. Don't freeze them!
{{115740052-0-51621:}}It needs to be cooler.
{{115740052-0-51628:}}Looks like a perfectly blended Sage's Dream! Pour the finished drink into that carafe.
{{115740052-0-49244:}}Hey! I want to talk to the heroic mortal, too!
{{115740052-0-49246:}}When we find Nantharion, we'd better be ready for a fight. I'll muster the Legion—and warn Vashabar, too.
{{115740052-0-49247:}}Chosen of fate, approach. We will have words.
{{115740052-0-49240:}}Over here, friend! We should talk.
{{115740052-0-49242:}}Come on, <<1>>. Let's go find <<2>>.
{{115740052-0-49243:}}The hero of the moment! Come speak with me when you can, friend.
{{115740052-0-49248:}}We might be able to avoid a pitched battle if we find a clever way to sabotage his plans.
{{115740052-0-49249:}}I doubt it will be that easy. And I intend to make sure Nantharion doesn't escape again.
{{115740052-0-49436:}}That closed the portal! Good work!
{{115740052-0-51507:}}Nahlia and the others are inside. Stay safe in there.
{{115740052-0-50778:}}I won't be defeated so easily!
{{115740052-0-50779:}}The door is behind that gap in the rocks.
{{115740052-0-48922:}}An excellent battle! Gather a fragment of the titan and we can return to the others.
{{115740052-0-51597:}}Hang on, I think I've figured it out. Let me know if you want any help.
{{115740052-0-51596:}}The knot belongs to me! You can't have it!
{{115740052-0-51592:}}Did you get it? Don't dawdle, pour us a round!
{{115740052-0-50105:}}Hear that? Bloodfiends beyond that door! Place a combustion canister and step back!
{{115740052-0-50107:}}Mind your step. The place is a bit of a mess thanks to that portal.
{{115740052-0-50101:}}Maerenah … what's happening to me, Maer?
{{115740052-0-50103:}}Check on Tham, friend. I … I need a moment.
{{115740052-0-50102:}}It will be all right, Tham. You'll be all right.
{{115740052-0-50109:}}We need to stop them!
{{115740052-0-51854:}}For now, I have given you what little ink we have left in the Scholarium. It's been many long years since the library saw regular use, and ink is now a rare resource.
{{115740052-0-51274:}}Proxy! Are you injured?
{{115740052-0-51275:}}The Skein of Secrets never failed before. May I see the relic?
{{115740052-0-51271:}}So many dead. What a waste ….
{{115740052-0-51272:}}That great skeleton above is one of the Bearers of Fargrave. Ithelia's changing it to its Mirrormoor reflection.
{{115740052-0-51273:}}We must hurry. I think I can create a portal shortcut.
{{115740052-0-51278:}}It even weakened you for me. Now I can claim it with ease!
{{115740052-0-49604:}}We cannot leave any trace of the ritual behind. You must take that scroll!
{{115740052-0-49605:}}There is something vile nearby. I sense we are close to a ritual item!
{{115740052-0-49607:}}The ritual is gaining strength! Quickly, burn the body!
{{115740052-0-49600:}}This one thinks Betu likes you!
{{115740052-0-49602:}}Arkay help us! There is powerful necromantic energy here. We must be near one of the objects from the ritual.
{{115740052-0-49549:}}Is that Beragon? These ruined mirrors look into different realities. They may be doors to the Many Paths. See if the Lamp of Clarity can free him.
{{115740052-0-49548:}}Can you hear me? Get me out of here!
{{115740052-0-49541:}}Hey! Can you see me? I can't find my way out!
{{115740052-0-49540:}}Hermaeus Mora could not predict what he could not perceive—Ithelia's scions, the Unseen. Come, we must find a way to escape.
{{115740052-0-50971:}}There you are! You just … vanished.
{{115740052-0-50848:}}We must study the scene carefully. Look for anything out of place.
{{115740052-0-50842:}}Pelena, why would you hurt Betu?
{{115740052-0-50972:}}Hmm. I see you've found whatever this is. It's not the Fable of the Netch, as I recall it.
{{115740052-0-50973:}}Nevertheless an entertaining read. I quite enjoyed the Netch bosom.
{{115740052-0-49957:}}No! The spell isn't complete!
{{115740052-0-49951:}}The relics, Mora's spell, and my magic together shall help you repair reality, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49952:}}Scruut, Tribune Alea, and I will meet you at the sites, friend.
{{115740052-0-49958:}}Flesh of the body, bones of the dead! Blood of the heart, awaken the grave!
{{115740052-0-51837:}}Bet there's lots of old notes down here.
{{115740052-0-51856:}}The skill is scribed. The magic of the Scholarium is calmed.
{{115740052-0-51858:}}He was still a little boy when I put that wooden sword in his hands. I had convinced myself that he would aspire to be like me. That he was a fighter.
{{115740052-0-48942:}}I'm going to find a ship out of Anvil. Perhaps we'll meet again in the west, traveler.
{{115740052-0-51859:}}Stand clear!
{{115740052-0-49666:}}Good work. We should not linger here, there is more to do.
{{115740052-0-50315:}}It worked. And Abolisher appears unaffected for now. Let us leave this place!
{{115740052-0-50318:}}Vargas, draw on my power! Defend the Loom!
{{115740052-0-49102:}}You are surrendering? Abandoning our sacred quest?
{{115740052-0-49782:}}Sir Klauser! I command you to lie perfectly still! Be serene!
{{115740052-0-49378:}}Yes, my king.
{{115740052-0-49379:}}Someone's coming! Get down!
{{115740052-0-49373:}}That takes care of the weapon stockpiles. Now let's head into the mine.
{{115740052-0-51424:}}Hang on. Me? Tend to the Scholarium?
{{115740052-0-49008:}}You've returned in one piece! I hope you gave that brigand what-for.
{{115740052-0-49009:}}Good news! The adventurer retrieved my dowry. We can continue on to Skingrad as planned. And I promise you both a pint of ale when we get there!
{{115740052-0-49002:}}Please, find what you can of my dowry and I'll compensate you handsomely.
{{115740052-0-49003:}}What's this? Did my betrothed hire someone to retrieve his dowry? How quaint.
{{115740052-0-49001:}}I pray you aren't another rogue come to take what's left.
{{115740052-0-49006:}}What joy can be found in a marriage fueled by coin?
{{115740052-0-49007:}}Help him if you feel so inclined, but be warned. The beasts of Fyrelight are ravenous.
{{115740052-0-49004:}}You should be warned. My beasts don't like losing their toys and they do love his shiny gifts.
{{115740052-0-49005:}}Doesn't Grander realize the opportunity I've given him? Why try to recover his bid for my hand?
{{115740052-0-50437:}}No quarry can escape me. Hounds, after it!
{{115740052-0-50436:}}Come now, little fawn. You cannot run forever.
{{115740052-0-50431:}}This place just keeps going up! How big is this tree, anyway?
{{115740052-0-50430:}}No, not that way! Please, concentrate!
{{115740052-0-50433:}}That shawl on the table … there's something strange about it.
{{115740052-0-50432:}}These ruins used to be on the hillside below. Hoperoot's branches raised them into the sky!
{{115740052-0-51740:}}Take my sigil. Use it to amplify the altar. And seek to better the world through your scribing.
{{115740052-0-51748:}}An old mine, maybe?
{{115740052-0-51448:}}There they are! No sudden movements, friend. We need a plan.
{{115740052-0-51447:}}You again! Why do you help the Scarlets? Is there more to take from me?
{{115740052-0-51446:}}Mudcrab apples! Look at those cute little bite marks! This is definitely Burnbiscuit's doing!
{{115740052-0-51444:}}Ah that's… something. Those bite marks are definitely from a troll.
{{115740052-0-51443:}}Good work, comrade! Hang onto that blade in case we run into another portal.
{{115740052-0-51441:}}Fallen-Knives, see to Urm. We'll find Valenia and stop Caelum.
{{115740052-0-51440:}}Done! But I think I got too excited. My shoulder is busted.
{{115740052-0-50633:}}I'll meet you at Gray's Hollow!
{{115740052-0-50632:}}Thank you. Did I hear you mention a knife? Can I see it?
{{115740052-0-50631:}}I'm trusting you to deal out justice for the dead Goblins.
{{115740052-0-50637:}}The Fable of the Dragon? This one's going to be a puzzler my friend.
{{115740052-0-50636:}}Oh gods, not here too! The totem is gone and the shaman is dead.
{{115740052-0-50635:}}I won't let you destroy my life's work!
{{115740052-0-50634:}}You'll never take me alive!
{{115740052-0-50639:}}A moment, assistant.
{{115740052-0-50638:}}See what I mean? I think King Nantharion could be at one of those marked locations.
{{115740052-0-49066:}}Why would Lady Weatherleah leave a riddle in her will?
{{115740052-0-49067:}}Could the four paws mean Betu? They certainly are not Mizzik's. Perhaps we can find a clue here in her study?
{{115740052-0-49060:}}I hope Betu's return means you retrieved the will, Mizzik?
{{115740052-0-51194:}}Our natures confound us. We need a different perspective. One you so elegantly provided. Mortal, let us speak.
{{115740052-0-50189:}}Hang on. What just happened?
{{115740052-0-50188:}}Well done. Let's talk about what comes next.
{{115740052-0-50186:}}Yes, good! Bring the crystal to the altar. Place it in the empty locus.
{{115740052-0-50180:}}Meddlers! Thieves! What have you done to my altar?
{{115740052-0-50182:}}We were just trying to calm things down. Who in Oblivion are you?
{{115740052-0-51588:}}Mortal! What part of the end of all existence didn't you understand?
{{115740052-0-51589:}}Sorilen! You're alive!
{{115740052-0-49638:}}I know this! A doorway to the Many Paths. Step through and I will follow.
{{115740052-0-49631:}}The pain is gone and the threads of fate have untangled. What happened in there, proxy?
{{115740052-0-49630:}}Now grab the drink and take it to that strange woman. I'll meet you upstairs.
{{115740052-0-49633:}}Over here. I sense a path that wishes to be explored. Shine the lamp, please.
{{115740052-0-49632:}}Another apparition? Oh, you're real. Please, come in. What can I get you?
{{115740052-0-49635:}}I sense this is the last path calling to me. Use the Lamp here, mortal.
{{115740052-0-49634:}}A new path appears. Use the Lamp, mortal.
{{115740052-0-50783:}}Blasted clever Daedra! Meet me in the courtyard!
{{115740052-0-50782:}}He's up on the wall. How can we help, commander?
{{115740052-0-50781:}}Commander, they're climbing over the walls! We can't—
{{115740052-0-50780:}}Stay alert while we look for Commander Merian.
{{115740052-0-50787:}}Let the legionaries handle the Daedra. We need to reach the commander.
{{115740052-0-50786:}}That's all of the traps. I hope they hurt.
{{115740052-0-50785:}}That's all the ropes I can see. Good work.
{{115740052-0-50784:}}For the shardmarshal! For Mirrormoor!
{{115740052-0-50992:}}Beragon, wait for us, damn it!
{{115740052-0-50993:}}Nantharion! Stop! A wildburn unleashed with the power from that well will destroy West Weald!
{{115740052-0-50990:}}Friends, the gate closed behind me. Hurry, use Abolisher. Nantharion is just ahead!
{{115740052-0-50994:}}Ahh, you found it! The true fable. Not as good as my version, of course.
{{115740052-0-50258:}}Wait … you can't just leave me here!
{{115740052-0-51787:}}No! We are too close! I claim the power! I will finish this!
{{115740052-0-51124:}}Hermaus Mora cannot save you now!
{{115740052-0-51125:}}Damn it. Fine, then we make for Varen's Wall.
{{115740052-0-51126:}}I can already feel the pull on Eyevea. Nothing we can do now will outpace the greed of a Daedric Prince.
{{115740052-0-51120:}}Hmm. Wouldn't that be something?
{{115740052-0-51121:}}Ithelia has not yet activated the Loom. We can still intervene!
{{115740052-0-51122:}}The mortals escaped from the Many Paths? So be it. Allow me to offer a more permanent solution!
{{115740052-0-51123:}}Defeat Shardmarshal Vargas so we can reach the Loom!
{{115740052-0-51128:}}Ah good, you're here! Give it a listen.
{{115740052-0-51129:}}Curate Gadayn! He's … gone.
{{115740052-0-51406:}}A fight, is it? This, this I can do.
{{115740052-0-51544:}}Whatever is causing this, I think it's in the next room. Come on!
{{115740052-0-50398:}}Come along. The tasting rooms are just a little farther in.
{{115740052-0-50397:}}Ah, there you are. We should investigate Zeggar's Blind next.
{{115740052-0-50390:}}My power abandons me here. I will follow if I can.
{{115740052-0-51049:}}Must I do everything myself?
{{115740052-0-51043:}}Souls? Ghost lights? Whatever they are, you set them free.
{{115740052-0-51040:}}My final mission. My wife, long gone. My son, estranged and beyond my reach. I was alone. A soldier's worst nightmare.
{{115740052-0-51047:}}Consider what I have said. We Daedra may be immutable, but you mortals are not.
{{115740052-0-51046:}}Lower your weapons, I only want to talk.
{{115740052-0-51045:}}I assume you still need to restore the other relics? I'll see you back at Beragon's townhouse.
{{115740052-0-49062:}}Nonsense. I'm sure Betu just needs time to remember me. Isn't that right, boy?
{{115740052-0-49468:}}Pretend you never saw me, traveler.
{{115740052-0-49469:}}Nothing, damn them!
{{115740052-0-49460:}}Why're you so mad? It's not like you can't make more wine.
{{115740052-0-49461:}}Watch yourselves. Who knows what dangers still lurk near the Loom.
{{115740052-0-49462:}}All right everyone. We recovered the Blue Aedral. As always, as soon as we sell it, everyone will get a share of the profits. Everyone except Ruri, that is.
{{115740052-0-49463:}}The taint of Mirrormoor remains strong here.
{{115740052-0-49464:}}The Loom … even destroyed, it radiates power.
{{115740052-0-49465:}}To think, Fargrave was once a part of Ithelia's realm.
{{115740052-0-49703:}}Let's get this over with.
{{115740052-0-49702:}}I will take back this land for my people! You cannot stop me!
{{115740052-0-51461:}}No! I am done!
{{115740052-0-51463:}}We're not so different!
{{115740052-0-51467:}}Some of those unstable orbs, again. Blocking our path.
{{115740052-0-50062:}}I don't think we're done with Ithelia, comrades.
{{115740052-0-50063:}}I think Ithelia has other concerns, which may become our problem later. For now, let's enjoy our victory.
{{115740052-0-50064:}}Beragon, tribune, beware! Shardmarshal Vargas is above you!
{{115740052-0-50065:}}The threads of fate surrounding Fargrave are in turmoil. Something significant shall soon occur.
{{115740052-0-51148:}}The relics are this way … gathering dust on the tiny mortal's wall.
{{115740052-0-48948:}}Quickly, grab the will!
{{115740052-0-48949:}}Right. Here you are.
{{115740052-0-48940:}}Curious. Let's talk.
{{115740052-0-49176:}}Damned dog! How are you still alive?
{{115740052-0-49177:}}The Count of Skingrad will decide your fate.
{{115740052-0-49174:}}Captives! And apparently under the influence of the wine.
{{115740052-0-49175:}}Friend, let's speak.
{{115740052-0-49172:}}Valente's journal said he had a coven of vampires. We should expect a fight.
{{115740052-0-51508:}}Noraine—to me. Now.
{{115740052-0-51502:}}I'm sorry. I never thought splitting up would get Val—
{{115740052-0-51503:}}Hush, Fallen-Knives. No one's blaming you.
{{115740052-0-51500:}}Well, maybe we're not quite ready to part again just yet.
{{115740052-0-51501:}}The Eight brought us back together, Hooke. We shouldn't depart in haste.
{{115740052-0-51506:}}Magnus watch over you, Nahlia. We'll keep watch out here.
{{115740052-0-51504:}}I'll … I'll take Valenia to Marbruk. To her family. It's what she would have wanted.
{{115740052-0-51505:}}Ah, good. You must be our backup. Irnard came through.
{{115740052-0-49370:}}That looks like another wildburn seed!
{{115740052-0-49371:}}Let's look around. And try to keep out of sight until we're ready to make a move.
{{115740052-0-49374:}}Here. The seed for Skingrad is ready, my king.
{{115740052-0-49375:}}Bring it to my throne room. Vargas and I will perform the final ritual and send the seed on its way!
{{115740052-0-49376:}}The Shardborn are fickle allies.
{{115740052-0-49377:}}We serve the same Prince. As long as I lead the Recollection, the Shardborn will aid us.
{{115740052-0-51384:}}There it is! Now, I'll go get the others—
{{115740052-0-51385:}}Didn't even know Daedra could climb ropes.
{{115740052-0-51386:}}I hope this makes them mad.
{{115740052-0-51380:}}You give the report, comrade.
{{115740052-0-51381:}}Let's talk, friend.
{{115740052-0-51383:}}Beragon! You'll pay for this, Nantharion!
{{115740052-0-50068:}}Vargas banished our allies into the Many Paths. It took everything I had just to shield us.
{{115740052-0-50069:}}Hmm. I think the order of the symbols is important, proxy.
{{115740052-0-50060:}}We cannot return Dawnwood to the seed it sprang from. But we, too, seek peace. We shall do everything we can to prove ourselves friends and allies to the Weald.
{{115740052-0-50066:}}Now! Destroy the wildburn seed!
{{115740052-0-51338:}}Welcome to the Labyrinthian! Or at least, my version of this ancient maze.
{{115740052-0-51331:}}Any attempt to save the Scholarium would only provoke Sheogorath. As far as I know, the Daedric Princes know nothing of the Luminaries.
{{115740052-0-51330:}}I trust the Luminaries. They will ensure the right person steps into the role.
{{115740052-0-51333:}}I have to seal this place away, though it feels like locking away part of my heart and soul. I suppose in some ways, it is.
{{115740052-0-51335:}}The Loom is destroyed, my Prince! We must leave this place!
{{115740052-0-51334:}}Why do you oppose me? The Loom is my gift to mortals everywhere!
{{115740052-0-51337:}}You understand. And you are ready to take the next step.
{{115740052-0-51336:}}Was something supposed to happen? Try looking at the fable again. Maybe there's a connection between the memory's name and a vow.
{{115740052-0-49178:}}Betu, where did you find this? Betu?
{{115740052-0-49179:}}Oh, good! I was starting to worry.
{{115740052-0-51645:}}You have completed my trials. You have shown wisdom in the use of your power.
{{115740052-0-51646:}}Take my sigil. Join its essence with the altar. And let the ink flow once again.
{{115740052-0-51640:}}It has been many long years since a mortal entered my domain. And now here you are, following in Ulfsild's footsteps.
{{115740052-0-51642:}}You are free, little one. Free to … what? Ah, of course. You may return with us if you wish.
{{115740052-0-50501:}}I think we've seen enough. Let's compare notes.
{{115740052-0-50500:}}Hello, friend. It looks like the Recollection is camped right on top of Niryastare. We need a plan.
{{115740052-0-50503:}}This can't be a coincidence.
{{115740052-0-50507:}}Unbridled anger fills these halls. We have entered a war zone. Find the last ingredient, but be careful.
{{115740052-0-50506:}}Dread fills this path. Find the ingredient, but use caution. We are not welcome here.
{{115740052-0-50509:}}I saw how to open a doorway. Let us return to the inn's cellar.
{{115740052-0-50508:}}This reflection seems resigned to her fate. Quite different from the other. Let us get the ingredient and go.
{{115740052-0-50749:}}How did Daedra get down here? Let's talk.
{{115740052-0-50746:}}Comrade, you're with me.
{{115740052-0-50745:}}Daedra emerging through the north door! With me, comrade!
{{115740052-0-50744:}}That's it for the ballista. Tribune, look sharp!
{{115740052-0-50743:}}Keep it up, I see another wave approaching.
{{115740052-0-50742:}}Nice targeting, mercenary! Get ready for the next wave.
{{115740052-0-50299:}}Hey, the signal fires! They're lit!
{{115740052-0-50298:}}Damn Wood Elf!
{{115740052-0-50291:}}Damned … mercenaries … got the drop on me.
{{115740052-0-50290:}}The anchors! Stop them!
{{115740052-0-50293:}}Why attack Varen's Watch, Elf? How many warriors do you have in there?
{{115740052-0-50294:}}We remember! We will never forget!
{{115740052-0-50297:}}The Recollection easily took your silly fortress!
{{115740052-0-50296:}}This one will tell us nothing.
{{115740052-0-51169:}}Sergeant?! Oh my! I'm so excited I can barely … barely …
{{115740052-0-51163:}}The energy is contained! Come here. Let Keshargo thank you.
{{115740052-0-51167:}}Oh!! My sweet fuzzy baby! My little Burnie-Wurnie! Who's my good bear? You are! Yes you are! Ah! Ahem …. You there, let's talk.
{{115740052-0-51387:}}That'll stop any Daedra. If they have legs.
{{115740052-0-49704:}}I never did like law folk.
{{115740052-0-49707:}}Let's head into the catacombs beneath these ruins to sort through what we've found, away from this rabble.
{{115740052-0-51555:}}I knew it. Trouble follows you again, Mother.
{{115740052-0-51554:}}Wait, you? Why are you helping me?
{{115740052-0-51557:}}There, to the south. I think I see something!
{{115740052-0-51556:}}Stairs to the west. They must lead to an inner chamber!
{{115740052-0-49388:}}No! The ritual is not complete!
{{115740052-0-48917:}}The ruins of Ceyond lie within this cave. Let's proceed with caution.
{{115740052-0-48915:}}Then let's not waste time. Let's go get this shard!
{{115740052-0-48914:}}I know those ruins. They're west of Skingrad.
{{115740052-0-48913:}}Everyone's back. Great. But I don't see anyone carrying anything that gets us closer to saving reality.
{{115740052-0-48912:}}Scruut awaits us at Beragon's townhouse. Let us return there at once.
{{115740052-0-48911:}}The Loom of the Untraveled Road. Damaged beyond repair but still impressive. Use the Echonir and see what memories remain.
{{115740052-0-48919:}}That must be the titan! Let's destroy it and gather a fragment.
{{115740052-0-48918:}}Scruut says the titan is somewhere in these ruins. I'll accompany our comrade. Beragon, Curate Gadayn, guard the entrance.
{{115740052-0-49382:}}Be careful. I remember encountering some deadly traps. And it looks like the Recollection's been busy down here, too.
{{115740052-0-49649:}}Yes, the will is returned and intact thanks to my assistant.
{{115740052-0-50692:}}She opened a portal! I'm leaping down!
{{115740052-0-51821:}}Comrade, Beragon waits for you upstairs on the balcony. Go talk to him.
{{115740052-0-51820:}}Contain the knot or this will never be finished.
{{115740052-0-51823:}}Look at that ink shimmer. Well done!
{{115740052-0-51824:}}Stand, knights of the Scholarium. Begin your watch. May it never end.
{{115740052-0-51826:}}Allow me to talk to Hermaeus Mora first, proxy.
{{115740052-0-50157:}}But aren't you curious where it came from? Forests like this don't usually spring up so quickly.
{{115740052-0-50152:}}Watch out! The necromantic forces are strong here!
{{115740052-0-50153:}}Hurry! The force of the ritual may bring the ruins down on top of us!
{{115740052-0-50150:}}I knew those Vashabar Wood Elves were to blame for all this!
{{115740052-0-50151:}}The ritual already awoke some of the dead within these ruins. We must be quick!
{{115740052-0-51873:}}Torvesard is vulnerable! Attack him now!
{{115740052-0-51871:}}Scruut, we need you!
{{115740052-0-51876:}}Huh. You don't see that every day. Nahlia's going to want to hear about this.
{{115740052-0-51877:}}Good to see you again! You'll find her over in the east wing with our newest arrival.
{{115740052-0-51874:}}Attack Torvesard now, proxy!
{{115740052-0-51875:}}Fly back to me when you have followed Ulfsild's instructions.
{{115740052-0-49380:}}I knew it! Nantharion leads the Recollection! And the Prince they serve must be Ithelia!
{{115740052-0-49514:}}It really worked? Maybe we do have a chance.
{{115740052-0-49516:}}Come, proxy. We must speak.
{{115740052-0-49510:}}Place the fragment in the center of the ritual circle.
{{115740052-0-49511:}}Excellent. Now place Abolisher, the Lamp of Clarity, and the Skein of Secrets around the fragment.
{{115740052-0-49512:}}Now proxy, join your power to mine and we shall align the threads of fate with the ritual.
{{115740052-0-49513:}}It is done. We have created a Mirror of Truth.
{{115740052-0-50831:}}These tunnels seem to run under the entire property! Good thing we have Betu's nose to lead us.
{{115740052-0-50830:}}Vashabar! Laeni and Clendagal have returned. Let them be heard.
{{115740052-0-50833:}}Get away from me you beasts!
{{115740052-0-50832:}}I hear Pelena's voice! She must be nearby.
{{115740052-0-50835:}}As you all know, our fathers refuse to support us. And so we invoke the Rite of Propagation, an ancient Bosmer custom.
{{115740052-0-50834:}}Vashabar, we need your help. Laeni and I want to marry.
{{115740052-0-50839:}}We gathered these symbols, representations of our roles in the village. An Ayleid mosaic for me.
{{115740052-0-51257:}}How dare you? You had no right!
{{115740052-0-49386:}}Vargas, help me prepare the seed!
{{115740052-0-49567:}}Sorilen's up ahead. What's she looking at?
{{115740052-0-49560:}}I am the Last Tomorrow, the Unweaver! I am filled with the power of the Many Paths! Come, Torvesard, away!
{{115740052-0-51679:}}Over there, friend! A spot to use your lens!
{{115740052-0-51672:}}Vargas is shielded, friend! Use Abolisher to destroy the portals!
{{115740052-0-51673:}}Portals again! Use Abolisher, friend—we've almost got her!
{{115740052-0-51674:}}Let's see how clever you are, mortal.
{{115740052-0-51675:}}Wish me luck, friend. Hopefully the Votary Commander has had her morning tea.
{{115740052-0-51676:}}Good job! Over here! The creatia is just through this door, I can smell it!
{{115740052-0-50429:}}You certainly took your time! The path is now clear, and the Emblem of the Last King calls to me! Come!
{{115740052-0-51867:}}Proxy, use Abolisher on the portal!
{{115740052-0-51781:}}I'm … relieved to hear it. The altar is yours, inheritor.
{{115740052-0-51861:}}A portal! Careful, I do not expect anything good to emerge.
{{115740052-0-51860:}}Stand back!
{{115740052-0-51863:}}Abolisher is charged. Unleash it on the portal!
{{115740052-0-49984:}}A reality tear. I hate those things! Place Abolisher near it—but not too close!
{{115740052-0-49989:}}Come, mortal. Let's finish this so I can get back to my usual, boring routine.
{{115740052-0-49033:}}How strange. Come, let us speak, traveler.
{{115740052-0-49032:}}That door bears the marks of Mirrormoor.
{{115740052-0-49031:}}What havoc these changes must be wreaking in Apocrypha's core!
{{115740052-0-49030:}}A dead end, but the path should continue. Use the Lamp of Clarity and see what it reveals.
{{115740052-0-49037:}}Mora hides in his sanctum? I will transform this realm and make it his tomb! Set wards in place, my scion. Fate's minions must not be allowed to interfere.
{{115740052-0-49036:}}Use the Echonir. Maybe it will offer a clue.
{{115740052-0-49035:}}If you insist on staying, that's your business. Just watch your back.
{{115740052-0-49039:}}Yes, my Prince. None shall find the wards.
{{115740052-0-49038:}}How generous. A whole drink after nearly losing an arm to a tharriker.
{{115740052-0-49793:}}Hah! The sooner we get those symbols the faster we can start planning the wedding.
{{115740052-0-51400:}}It's my fault. I said we should split up. Cover more ground.
{{115740052-0-49795:}}And finally, Sir Klauser takes his cue! Please, tell me your thoughts.
{{115740052-0-50464:}}If you would place all three items that we collected onto the altar, we can proceed.
{{115740052-0-50463:}}Gather the relics, proxy. We shall have need of them.
{{115740052-0-50461:}}Try not to call too much attention to yourself. I don't want to stress the Goblins more than necessary.
{{115740052-0-48992:}}Begone wretch! The power of the well is mine!
{{115740052-0-49792:}}I can't rutting believe it! Can you rutting believe it, Clen?
{{115740052-0-49791:}}Right. From there, we head for Anvil. But it's … oh. Traveler, hello.
{{115740052-0-49796:}}Now! Time to refine Lady Sowerra's performance. Come speak to me.
{{115740052-0-49797:}}Stand guard, Mr. Klauser! This new act requires focus.
{{115740052-0-49794:}}Someday we'll have to explore this ruin more completely. Not today though.
{{115740052-0-50668:}}The lens and the fables are signposts to seek the Luminaries. And they will teach you far more than I ever could.
{{115740052-0-50669:}}You'll pay for that!
{{115740052-0-50666:}}If you are seeing this, the Crow has set you on the path to learn the art of Scribing. A world of magic awaits you.
{{115740052-0-50667:}}I've left behind another sort of guide: the True-Sight Lens. Seek it out in the east wing.
{{115740052-0-50292:}}Gaius? Are you here? It's Tribune Alea.
{{115740052-0-51201:}}Well done! The dormant portal has awakened.
{{115740052-0-51200:}}A dormant portal! Proxy, we must find a way to activate it.
{{115740052-0-49598:}}I've always preferred cats, but you've made a good argument for dogs, Betu.
{{115740052-0-49599:}}Oh? Well you do seem like a very good boy! I'll be sure to order a lifetime supply of steak dinners!
{{115740052-0-49921:}}So it was true. Marius Gallo, hero of Ontus … a deserter and a bandit.
{{115740052-0-49923:}}Until we meet again, wanderer.
{{115740052-0-51160:}}By Akatosh, Burnbiscuit! I mean, Lord Svendalmor! I'm so glad you're back! Let's talk, traveler!
{{115740052-0-49701:}}The deputy! Mercenaries, kill them and dump the elixir into the reservoir! Come, Raxalee. We need to get out of here.
{{115740052-0-49700:}}Give me that. I'll sign her damn name! In case you haven't noticed, we've got company.
{{115740052-0-49709:}}Forces of Mirrormoor, protect me!
{{115740052-0-49708:}}Majestic! Oh how I'd love to know how they carved these wings. Was it one sculptor? Two? More? It's so lifelike!
{{115740052-0-50224:}}Peace with the Weald is all well and good, but what about Vashabar? Are we sure there's not another Nantharion lurking in the leaves?
{{115740052-0-50227:}}There will always be spoiled fruit on the tree. That's the way of things.
{{115740052-0-51906:}}Ha ha!
{{115740052-0-51907:}}Wait, the path isn't down there! Come back!
{{115740052-0-51904:}}Xoryn said we had competition. But you don't look like too much trouble.
{{115740052-0-51909:}}This is where I leave you. I know you can do it! Good luck!
{{115740052-0-50361:}}The forge should be around here somewhere.
{{115740052-0-50360:}}Kwama always make me uncomfortable. Let's find the forge and get out of here.
{{115740052-0-50362:}}Fathoms Drift … imagine the horrors that have washed upon its shores.
{{115740052-0-50369:}}Welcome to my domain, adventurer. Bearer of my fable.
{{115740052-0-48897:}}Not a legionary in sight. Where are they?
{{115740052-0-51014:}}I'll fill you in shortly. We're here to help. Friend, can I have a word?
{{115740052-0-51015:}}Nahlia, please. Is there anything you and your friend can do?
{{115740052-0-51016:}}I just want him to know I'm here.
{{115740052-0-51017:}}One moment, Elic. This ink is … it's working. You're headed to Dragon Bridge. Walk with Magnus.
{{115740052-0-51010:}}Father, I got here as soon as I could. Please. Can you hear me?
{{115740052-0-51011:}}I'm sorry, my love. He's very weak.
{{115740052-0-51012:}}Elic, Melvina, hello. It must be a surprise to see me.
{{115740052-0-51013:}}Nahlia? What are you doing here?
{{115740052-0-51018:}}Every mercenary in Dark Company fights to their last breath!
{{115740052-0-51019:}}Father! It's Elic. I'm here. Just be still.
{{115740052-0-49411:}}There it is! Another welkynd stone. Go ahead, take it.
{{115740052-0-49410:}}I think the Lamp's found another stone. Give it a try.
{{115740052-0-49413:}}Amazing. The Lamp pulled the stone into our reality somehow. How does this work?
{{115740052-0-49412:}}Look at that! Another stone. Take it, friend.
{{115740052-0-49415:}}That's three lesser stones. There should be one more to find.
{{115740052-0-49414:}}Another stone. Two more, and we'll see what the great welkynd stone is protecting.
{{115740052-0-49416:}}That's the last of them. Let's return to the great welkynd stone and see if we can open the vault!
{{115740052-0-51474:}}There! The sewer grate! We can get out that way!
{{115740052-0-51472:}}No quarter, nonbeliever!
{{115740052-0-51377:}}Hello friends! You're not meant to go straight down. That's why I'm here!
{{115740052-0-51470:}}Ah ha ha ha!
{{115740052-0-50978:}}Hello? Anyone? Tribune Alea, where are you?
{{115740052-0-50977:}}Beragon! He's somewhere beyond that gate. Use Abolisher!
{{115740052-0-49151:}}If this letter is true, then Pelena played a role in Uriel's death! And this signature, is this the name of our resident imposter?
{{115740052-0-51737:}}Only one remaining, Not-Ulfsild. Nahlia, a portal to Blight Bog Sump please!
{{115740052-0-51736:}}These creatures only exist in the Dawnwood. They look so strange.
{{115740052-0-51731:}}Blight and root rot! How could Sorilen join the Recollection? They're murderers!
{{115740052-0-51730:}}Sorilen has a point. These ruins are too wondrous to let sit forgotten.
{{115740052-0-51733:}}Another obstacle. Use the Lamp here, if you would.
{{115740052-0-51738:}}Well done, Not-Ulfsild! Nahlia will see you back to Suran. Where father and son reunite.
{{115740052-0-49133:}}I won't let you down, captain. This way, friend!
{{115740052-0-49451:}}<Excited Bark>
{{115740052-0-50038:}}We need to find Captain Leronus. Meet me at the barracks on the south side of the estate.
{{115740052-0-49458:}}I can't believe Ruri betrayed us. He could've gotten Lazen or the others killed!
{{115740052-0-51533:}}No picks? I might have a loose one around here somewhere ….
{{115740052-0-51535:}}Use Abolisher on the portal, friend!
{{115740052-0-51534:}}Now! Strike the portal with Abolisher!
{{115740052-0-51289:}}The memory of a great battle? Who are Ithelia's forces fighting?
{{115740052-0-51288:}}Guard the door! They must not reach the well!
{{115740052-0-49669:}}Do not ask me what is in that bowl. I do not wish to know.
{{115740052-0-49662:}}Be careful, that blade has a wicked edge to it.
{{115740052-0-49663:}}Good work. We should keep moving, there are more undead to exorcise.
{{115740052-0-48910:}}The Loom of the Untraveled Road lies ahead of us. Stay alert for any of Mirrormoor's Daedra.
{{115740052-0-49301:}}Father? Is that you?
{{115740052-0-49300:}}If this memory interests you so much, allow me to send you there!
{{115740052-0-49303:}}The clerk kept a spare key in a box by her desk. We'll need that to open the vault.
{{115740052-0-49302:}}Hush, Abel! You'll give us away!
{{115740052-0-49307:}}But you do not see everything, Mora. In the Many Paths, all things are possible. I will write my own fate!
{{115740052-0-49306:}}Why continue this futile struggle, Ithelia? Every fate before me says you cannot win.
{{115740052-0-49309:}}I can't wait any longer. I need to stop Nantharion!
{{115740052-0-49308:}}Ithelia, wait!
{{115740052-0-51056:}}I'm glad you're back, Leramil. Maybe you can help us understand what happened to Ithelia in Miscarcand.
{{115740052-0-50058:}}I want no war with Vashabar, but Nantharion left Ostumir in ruins and killed our people.
{{115740052-0-51098:}}That damaged the portal! Gather more energy and try again!
{{115740052-0-49149:}}Welcome, proxy. Let us speak before we go inside.
{{115740052-0-49148:}}If you already found the missing key, you may be able to unlock Lady Weatherleah's bed chambers.
{{115740052-0-49147:}}Mizzik recalls a gilded key revealed to us by Betu.
{{115740052-0-49146:}}Thank you, Pelena. We will investigate all lingering threads. Traveler, let's speak with the gardener next.
{{115740052-0-49145:}}Thank you, Uriel. That's all. We should speak to Pelena next, traveler.
{{115740052-0-49143:}}A confession? And a flowery one at that. Mizzik isn't sure what to make of this.
{{115740052-0-49142:}}Tea? This one smells ginger, hibiscus, and something else. Something sickly.
{{115740052-0-49140:}}There you are! Let's talk.
{{115740052-0-49497:}}We'll make sure the path behind you remains clear!
{{115740052-0-50546:}}I will restore the glory of Mirrormoor!
{{115740052-0-51437:}}Crow, how would you feel about us opening our doors to the Guild? Letting the world appreciate Ulfsild's legacy firsthand?
{{115740052-0-49806:}}I told you the fort's seen better days. Let's look around a little.
{{115740052-0-49807:}}Over there! A wildburn seed—and an Echonir memory, too!
{{115740052-0-49804:}}You won't ruin all my hard work!
{{115740052-0-49805:}}Coven, to me!
{{115740052-0-49808:}}Another seed! Destroy it, friend.
{{115740052-0-49809:}}Be wary. If I sensed the presence of Daedric power, the Recollection likely noticed it as well.
{{115740052-0-51570:}}Thank you. And you, friend. I won't forget all your help in this.
{{115740052-0-49894:}}Stop faking. We're not going back in there.
{{115740052-0-49897:}}Now, dead creature! Prepare to rise again!
{{115740052-0-51514:}}I hoped things could have ended differently with Marcan. But we're all safe. I couldn't ask for more.
{{115740052-0-51512:}}I'll be damned, there are survivors! Use the key and open the vault.
{{115740052-0-50953:}}Away, beasts! Oh, you there, help me! They're after my bait, but don't hurt them!
{{115740052-0-50155:}}Be careful. We are not safe inside these ruins.
{{115740052-0-50798:}}Please, Marcan! Naku did not know you were there! None of us did!
{{115740052-0-50799:}}That is no excuse. I almost envy you, Scarlet. Today you have a chance to pay for all your mistakes.
{{115740052-0-50249:}}Let's rally at the Stonechip Tavern when you're done, deputy.
{{115740052-0-51112:}}I warned you against interfering, mortal, but you refused to heed me.
{{115740052-0-51115:}}A Daedric apparatus of unimaginable power. What the One Who Knows feared.
{{115740052-0-51114:}}What in the name of all the Divines is that thing?
{{115740052-0-51117:}}Friend, look out! Agghh!
{{115740052-0-51116:}}I see Ithelia, Shardmarshal Vargas, and Torvesard down there.
{{115740052-0-49758:}}Careful, stranger. The ones who murdered my friends are close. They may return at any moment.
{{115740052-0-49759:}}When the seed sprouts, this ancient shrine will awaken. Its power will help fill the well of Miscarcand.
{{115740052-0-49752:}}The scent wafting off those grapes. It's tantalizing.
{{115740052-0-49753:}}That must be their commander. Keep low.
{{115740052-0-49750:}}Tribune! Praise the gods. We could use your help.
{{115740052-0-49751:}}This is it, the laboratory. We need to destroy it all. Let me explain, friend.
{{115740052-0-50166:}}So it was the king all along! How did we miss that?
{{115740052-0-49385:}}Greenspeaker Sorilen, deal with the intruders! They must not interfere with the ritual!
{{115740052-0-51279:}}There is no reasoning with a fool. Protect the knot!
{{115740052-0-50158:}}King Nantharion says the forest's a gift of the Green and I believe him!
{{115740052-0-50159:}}And what about the devastated region between Dawnwood and the rest of the Weald. They blame us for that, I hear.
{{115740052-0-50156:}}Why should we care what the Colovians think? Dawnwood is a miracle and it's ours!
{{115740052-0-51434:}}Does this mean we'll be moving on? Not that I don't love the smell of old tome dust.
{{115740052-0-51368:}}Ah, that might be the riddle to solve this!
{{115740052-0-51369:}}Bless the Divines. Quickly! Please untie me!
{{115740052-0-50554:}}Use the portal to help Scruut!
{{115740052-0-50558:}}Assistant, have I ever regaled you with my research on ancestral tombs in Vvardenfell? It would only take a few hours.
{{115740052-0-50559:}}Allow me to enlighten you, assistant. Keep an eye out for Daedric symbology. The Ayleids worshiped the Daedra, and were destroyed by Daedra-haters. You can take notes if you need to.
{{115740052-0-49889:}}The Legion doesn't know what happened here.
{{115740052-0-49882:}}To what end? As long as I remain in this reality, the threat I pose persists. My power will always find a way to return to me. Such is the nature of our princely dispositions.
{{115740052-0-49883:}}I sense an anomaly here, proxy. A place where the veil between realms can be parted. Perhaps Abolisher can be of use?
{{115740052-0-49880:}}There, the maze is below! At the heart of that maze is the way forward.
{{115740052-0-49881:}}The heart of the maze! Our way forward lies within, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49886:}}Now, you have shown we who are called Daedric Princes that there are always possibilities. Even for us. Farewell, mortal.
{{115740052-0-49887:}}Now leave this place, mortals! And understand that you go with the gratitude of the One Who Knows.
{{115740052-0-49884:}}The threads of fate agree with you, but what choice do we have? You are Daedra. Immortal. Forever. I see no other path before us.
{{115740052-0-49885:}}The chamber to the north should be the heart of the maze. But it seems we must find another entrance.
{{115740052-0-51435:}}That's up to my colleague here. Nahlia, what's your plan?
{{115740052-0-51601:}}That's right, mercenary. I bear another message.
{{115740052-0-51600:}}You two go ahead. I need to report to Count Calantius. I'll catch up with you later.
{{115740052-0-51603:}}Spilled blood and displaced families aren't justice!
{{115740052-0-51602:}}The Recollection seeks justice, Beragon. For all Bosmer!
{{115740052-0-51605:}}The Recollection destroyed this village! Who knows what other harm the rapid growth caused?
{{115740052-0-51604:}}We've been friends forever! Why won't you trust me?
{{115740052-0-51607:}}I thought you'd understand. I thought you had vision. Goodbye, Beragon.
{{115740052-0-51608:}}No, Sorilen! Wait!
{{115740052-0-49268:}}Let's celebrate not only our victories, but the heroic actions of our friend here. They defeated the rogue Dremora, Vargas and Torvesard. Took down Nantharion, the false king. They saved West Weald, maybe the entire world!
{{115740052-0-49269:}}So raise a glass and shout a cheer! Thank you, my friend, for always doing what you do best!
{{115740052-0-49266:}}One more moment, Beragon. I need to speak with our friend first.
{{115740052-0-49267:}}Everyone, your attention, please!
{{115740052-0-49264:}}There's Beragon! I think he's found something.
{{115740052-0-49265:}}Very well, but the legionary must remain here.
{{115740052-0-49262:}}I can open the way for you. The wellspring of power awaits in a starry vault deep beneath the city. Come. I will show you.
{{115740052-0-49263:}}We have good cause. We've come to warn him of a danger to Vashabar.
{{115740052-0-49260:}}Miscarcand was the ancient realm of my ancestors, my Prince. But the well lies hidden.
{{115740052-0-49261:}}Thank you, tribune. Come, friend.
{{115740052-0-49369:}}That shawl … there's something strange about it.
{{115740052-0-50710:}}I have heard whispers of paths such as this. They can be found throughout Apocrypha. Press on, proxy.
{{115740052-0-49344:}}I spotted the seed just up the hill.
{{115740052-0-51352:}}I knew Calvo could do it!
{{115740052-0-51445:}}That's a troll claw, but look at the bluish smoke! Definitely one of those warped creatures.
{{115740052-0-51191:}}And Torvesard, my most faithful. I consign your essence to nothingness, never to return. Be at peace at last.
{{115740052-0-49294:}}You made another portal! Let's go!
{{115740052-0-50703:}}Now where could that mangy dog have gotten off to?
{{115740052-0-50702:}}Fine. Then you can help deal with your cousin and that inane investigator.
{{115740052-0-50701:}}I don't know what you're playing at, but you were a fool to come here.
{{115740052-0-50706:}}Commander, I see two legionaries trapped outside the barricade.
{{115740052-0-49397:}}And a grim tomb for Greenspeaker Sorilen. Friend, we should talk.
{{115740052-0-49394:}}Follow Nantharion! He must know a way out!
{{115740052-0-50459:}}I scouted around, and the Goblins look agitated here, too. Let's see what we can find.
{{115740052-0-50552:}}Use the portal to help Beragon!
{{115740052-0-51870:}}We need aid. Beragon, come forth!
{{115740052-0-48947:}}Halt. Your invitation, please.
{{115740052-0-50910:}}Let my word go forth. Purge Ithelia from every mind in our shared reality, now and for eternity.
{{115740052-0-50916:}}See you back in Vashabar. We've faced the bugs, now to face my father.
{{115740052-0-50915:}}I'll meet you back in Vashabar. To perform the rite, and face my father.
{{115740052-0-50691:}}We need to talk, comrade.
{{115740052-0-50693:}}I'll tackle her in. Follow us!
{{115740052-0-51254:}}Very well, but we'll accompany you. Don't try anything.
{{115740052-0-51255:}}I don't like this, Sarragwen. They might use their vile magic on us!
{{115740052-0-51252:}}Finally, there you are! There's been a misunderstanding. Please, let me explain.
{{115740052-0-51253:}}Please, let my friend speak with your prisoner. We're all eager to resolve this.
{{115740052-0-51250:}}Why don't you explain how you escaped? Or what you did to my wife?
{{115740052-0-51251:}}What's going on, Elelorn? I just checked on the prisoner. She's secure.
{{115740052-0-50862:}}No glyphics, no repressed memories. Just you and I as the last witnesses to the existence of the Prince of Paths. We were bound by this threat to reality. Now we share this final secret. Farewell, mortal.
{{115740052-0-50863:}}Mercenary, I bring word from Tribune Alea!
{{115740052-0-50860:}}That's Fort Dirich, an old watchtower to the northwest of Skingrad. I'll meet you there, friend.
{{115740052-0-50861:}}Run! This tree-fort's coming down around us!
{{115740052-0-50869:}}Another student perhaps?
{{115740052-0-49970:}}That was the last of the relics? Then let's head back to Beragon's townhouse.
{{115740052-0-50985:}}I think it worked!
{{115740052-0-50984:}}What in Y'ffre's name? Is that a squirrel?
{{115740052-0-50987:}}Go deal with the remaining relics. I'll see you again at my townhouse in Skingrad.
{{115740052-0-50981:}}I am the Terror of the Weald! You never should have left us, Maerenah!
{{115740052-0-50983:}}(Loud chattering)
{{115740052-0-50982:}}The terror ends here, Balandrus!
{{115740052-0-50266:}}This thing's as stable as I can make it. Let's head in before another surge of magic!
{{115740052-0-50267:}}Over here! Get me out of these bonds!
{{115740052-0-50956:}}Thank you, stranger. That's the last time I try baiting a snare after it's set. Ugh, guzzards are awful.
{{115740052-0-50957:}}We will guard the seed with our lives, my king.
{{115740052-0-50954:}}Excellent, now throw it! Quickly, as hard as you can!
{{115740052-0-51132:}}Why would he marry a mortal? It's beneath him!
{{115740052-0-51931:}}<unhinged scream of rage>
{{115740052-0-51689:}}No matter, mortal. More of our forces will come through soon.
{{115740052-0-51688:}}Looks like you found something, at least.
{{115740052-0-51680:}}This note smells like the nearby room, we must be getting close!
{{115740052-0-51683:}}We rejoin the Scholarium, as it should be. Let's converse.
{{115740052-0-51685:}}This place is massive! And so beautiful.
{{115740052-0-51684:}}Adventurer, hah! I found you.
{{115740052-0-51687:}}Climbed up here. Full plate armor on. Huge mistake.
{{115740052-0-51686:}}Go on ahead. I'll be right behind you. Llaren would kill me if I didn't take a few rubbings before we leave.
{{115740052-0-50339:}}The Rustwall gardens. Our map indicates a spot on the western side.
{{115740052-0-50336:}}Here we are! Where the fabled chase began.
{{115740052-0-50335:}}Grab the map and let's go. We need that key.
{{115740052-0-50333:}}I never thought I'd be so happy to hear the ringing of a bell!
{{115740052-0-51918:}}Use your power responsibly.
{{115740052-0-50722:}}So this is the memorial Lady Weatherleah built for her son.
{{115740052-0-50287:}}Same at the quarry. Things are finally looking up for us, my love.
{{115740052-0-50986:}}Quick, follow them!
{{115740052-0-50989:}}Hm, where is it now…. Aha! Assistant, this is where they had been keeping some items that they uncovered in the excavation.
{{115740052-0-50075:}}Vargas diverted my portal! She trapped us in Ithelia's prison. Look for a way out, proxy!
{{115740052-0-50074:}}Ithelia does not wish to be disturbed. Rot in the very prison that held her for all those eons!
{{115740052-0-50077:}}I'll try to decipher the map later. Keep going, friends. We can't let the Recollection take the king hostage!
{{115740052-0-50076:}}I see a memory. Use the Echonir.
{{115740052-0-49043:}}Hey! Wait for me.
{{115740052-0-51768:}}The aesthetics of Mirrormoor have a certain beauty, but they do not belong in Apocrypha.
{{115740052-0-51769:}}I sense more than just the master of Apocrypha ahead. We must find Ithelia!
{{115740052-0-51767:}}Our way forward! Now the real work begins.
{{115740052-0-51762:}}What are they pointing at?
{{115740052-0-51760:}}I understand … and I accept.
{{115740052-0-51761:}}Now, leave us.

{{204987124-0-81011:}}Can I ask you about the Many Paths.
{{204987124-0-81015:}}So I just need to use the lens to find the creatia?
{{204987124-0-79319:}}What do Shardmarshal Vargas and King Nantharion want?
{{204987124-0-79318:}}What did we discover?
{{204987124-1-79020:}}She's a patient woman.
{{204987124-0-80819:}}Interesting.
{{204987124-0-81438:}}I see. I'll meet you in the Outlaws Refuge of Skingrad.
{{204987124-0-78596:}}He's mingling, but I can pass along a message if you want.
{{204987124-0-78598:}}I will help question the family members.
{{204987124-0-81298:}}All right. Let's get in there, then.
{{204987124-0-78599:}}Right. I'll do that.
{{204987124-1-81698:}}What else can you tell me about this place?
{{204987124-1-81691:}}The Order of the Lamp. Can you tell me more about them?
{{204987124-0-82014:}}Where are we stealing creatia from Mehrunes Dagon?
{{204987124-0-82016:}}Hermaeus Mora? Where are we stealing his creatia?
{{204987124-0-82018:}}Tell me about Ithelia.
{{204987124-0-82019:}}Why do they call you Leramil the Wise?
{{204987124-1-81349:}}Head for the Valente Vineyards.
{{204987124-0-81434:}}Of course. Take the blade.
{{204987124-0-81578:}}We'll destroy the portal. How do we find it?
{{204987124-0-81601:}}I'll go talk to Spinner Belwelas, then.
{{204987124-1-80532:}}What will happen to Ithelia's minions now?
{{204987124-0-80052:}}Does it matter which tasks I complete?
{{204987124-0-80054:}}I'll return when the challenges are done.
{{204987124-0-80950:}}I'll complete some of your safeguard tasks and return, Gryphon.
{{204987124-1-81986:}}How did you and the Gryphon become friends?
{{204987124-0-78658:}}She seemed as interested in finding out what her husband is up to as you are.
{{204987124-0-78653:}}You're in the Imperial Legion. Isn't fighting part of the job?
{{204987124-1-78898:}}Why turn your back on your vampiric abilities?
{{204987124-0-78414:}}Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?
{{204987124-1-81107:}}How did you become marshal to Count Calantius?
{{204987124-0-79670:}}Perhaps.
{{204987124-1-81108:}}Tell me about Feldagard Keep.
{{204987124-1-81109:}}What do you know about the attacking forces?
{{204987124-0-79671:}}Thanks.
{{204987124-0-78412:}}Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?
{{204987124-0-80096:}}Does that mean you'll be staying here in the Scholarium?
{{204987124-0-79500:}}There are plenty of wolves in the den, Grander.
{{204987124-0-79502:}}I'll see you later, then.
{{204987124-0-81003:}}What's strange about a mortal entering the Many Paths?
{{204987124-0-81691:}}What else can you tell me about this place?
{{204987124-5-82016:}}What do I have to do in Hermaeus Mora's realm?
{{204987124-0-78293:}}Are you sure Ithelia is responsible?
{{204987124-0-80771:}}I'll talk to Nahlia, then.
{{204987124-0-80770:}}Why does Laeni call you Agawen Ciiril?
{{204987124-0-80777:}}Is there anything that can be done?
{{204987124-0-80775:}}Ulrath and all your legionaries were dead. I found this report he wrote before he died.
{{204987124-0-81550:}}I'll help you find King Nantharion and stop him.
{{204987124-0-81551:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-81552:}}Shouldn't the Skein of Secrets show us where Ithelia is?
{{204987124-0-80890:}}What is the arcane knot?
{{204987124-1-81912:}}Tell me more about the invitation you found.
{{204987124-0-78257:}}Do you think they were after the Blue Aedral?
{{204987124-0-78255:}}You mentioned Blue Aedral a few times. What exactly is it?
{{204987124-0-80737:}}I'll read your list, then.
{{204987124-1-81910:}}Do all the Luminaries have fables like this?
{{204987124-1-78681:}}Where did you get it?
{{204987124-2-81277:}}Valenia has a grandchild only a little older than Ernico was. Spare her, for a child's sake.
{{204987124-2-81276:}}Valenia has a grandchild only a little older than Ernico was. Spare her, for a child's sake.
{{204987124-0-80734:}}I'll place the fable.
{{204987124-1-81915:}}Tell me more about the invitation you found.
{{204987124-1-81916:}}Just so you know, I took care of the Terrors. But why did the invitation cause you concern?
{{204987124-0-80738:}}Where can I find the list?
{{204987124-3-81109:}}The report we found in Hoperoot, tell me about that.
{{204987124-3-79688:}}You know, I've confronted Molag Bal.
{{204987124-1-78919:}}I don't have an invitation.
{{204987124-0-79096:}}What do you think?
{{204987124-0-79093:}}What's our next move?
{{204987124-0-81391:}}What's next for you, Orissa?
{{204987124-0-81397:}}All right. Let's make a Sage's Dream.
{{204987124-0-81395:}}What should I do?
{{204987124-0-81398:}}That's not all?
{{204987124-0-81399:}}That's not all?
{{204987124-0-80119:}}Where do you fit in with this?
{{204987124-0-80113:}}How can we stop the ritual?
{{204987124-0-80112:}}Why does the ritual need to be stopped?
{{204987124-0-80111:}}Sounds dangerous.
{{204987124-0-80110:}}I can't say that I have. Are these published books?
{{204987124-0-80114:}}How can we stop the ritual?
{{204987124-2-80826:}}The news about King Nantharion hasn't changed your mind?
{{204987124-0-79777:}}So you want the Wood Elves of Vashabar to stay?
{{204987124-0-79765:}}What will you do next, Tribune Alea?
{{204987124-0-79315:}}You don't know, do you?
{{204987124-0-79314:}}How do I know which one is correct?
{{204987124-0-79317:}}Why is the Recollection seeking these relics now?
{{204987124-0-79312:}}What happens now, Constable Yabren?
{{204987124-2-81708:}}What did you get up to since the last time we met?
{{204987124-1-79780:}}What is her title, Votary?
{{204987124-1-78321:}}You really don't know where these crystaljack wasps came from?
{{204987124-0-81026:}}Is there anything else you can tell me about the Lucent Citadel?
{{204987124-1-79458:}}You're proud of Vashabar?
{{204987124-0-78393:}}How did you find this case?
{{204987124-0-78390:}}What's that supposed to mean?
{{204987124-0-78391:}}And you mentioned that the invitation specifically suggested the vampires bring their servants?
{{204987124-0-78396:}}How did you find this case?
{{204987124-0-78397:}}Tell me more about <<1>>'s death.
{{204987124-0-78394:}}Tell me more about <<1>>'s death.
{{204987124-0-78395:}}Lady Weatherleagh's missing son is alive?
{{204987124-0-78398:}}Lady Weatherleagh's missing son is alive?
{{204987124-0-78399:}}You think the tharriker serve the Wood Elves?
{{204987124-0-81748:}}And that's the paradox?
{{204987124-0-81747:}}So she spoke to the Dragon before she lost the Scholarium.
{{204987124-0-81746:}}Right.
{{204987124-0-81741:}}Can I ask you questions, to understand you better?
{{204987124-0-80839:}}Where is she?
{{204987124-0-80834:}}Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town.
{{204987124-0-82098:}}But you saw the truth. You know what happened. You can change.
{{204987124-0-82099:}}Can't you simply surrender?
{{204987124-0-82094:}}Wasn't Ithelia different when she wandered West Weald? She was as powerless as a mortal.
{{204987124-0-82095:}}No but she walked among mortals, experienced change in herself and her reflections. Can we use that?
{{204987124-0-82096:}}What are you thinking, Scruut?
{{204987124-1-81614:}}Who threatened you?
{{204987124-1-81610:}}I can ask Pim about the knife. Maybe she knows.
{{204987124-0-81757:}}They were bringing Daedra through a portal. We shut it down.
{{204987124-2-81004:}}I'm curious about a different topic.
{{204987124-2-81006:}}I'm curious about a different topic.
{{204987124-2-81008:}}Why would an Ithelia lose control of her powers?
{{204987124-0-79234:}}What's your role in the West Weald Legion?
{{204987124-2-81919:}}What do you know about the vineyard and winery?
{{204987124-0-79414:}}What are your options?
{{204987124-0-79418:}}Why?
{{204987124-1-81667:}}Your commander was happy?
{{204987124-1-81666:}}You seem particularly interested in the Ayleids.
{{204987124-1-81664:}}Heard from Eveli Sharp-Arrow lately?
{{204987124-1-79395:}}You fought in Cyrodiil?
{{204987124-1-81668:}}Are you looking forward to the role?
{{204987124-0-80269:}}What can you tell us about the vampires?
{{204987124-0-80261:}}How do you know?
{{204987124-0-78748:}}What are you and <<1>> doing in West Weald?
{{204987124-0-78741:}}I'll stop their rituals and save any remaining civilians.
{{204987124-0-78742:}}Rituals?
{{204987124-0-79830:}}Thank you.
{{204987124-0-81291:}}The new forest?
{{204987124-0-82111:}}Your power runs into the Scholarium through the door?
{{204987124-0-82110:}}What's your opinion?
{{204987124-0-82113:}}I have a few other questions before I go.
{{204987124-0-82112:}}I have a few other questions before I go.
{{204987124-0-82115:}}If the threat to reality comes from your power, what about someplace where there is no power?
{{204987124-0-82114:}}I have a few other questions before I go.
{{204987124-0-82118:}}Then is my service to Hermaeus Mora done now, Scruut?
{{204987124-1-81428:}}What does he do?
{{204987124-0-80108:}}Were you able to convince Count Calantius to send more legionaries to Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-80109:}}How have you fared since we last met?
{{204987124-0-82015:}}I've gone up against Nocturnal in the past.
{{204987124-0-82010:}}Where are we stealing creatia from Mehrunes Dagon?
{{204987124-1-81842:}}These echoes. Can you tell me about them?
{{204987124-1-81342:}}How can I help?
{{204987124-1-78998:}}I was sent here by Commandant Salerius to destroy crates of misprinted invitations.
{{204987124-1-78995:}}Why are you interested in Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-1-78994:}}What can you tell me about Elenglynn?
{{204987124-0-80199:}}But we don't have the Skein of Secrets.
{{204987124-0-79260:}}Can we help him?
{{204987124-0-79265:}}Ghrakug, stay with me!
{{204987124-2-81608:}}What do you teach the children?
{{204987124-0-80430:}}And then what happened?
{{204987124-0-80431:}}Valenia told me what happened the night before the fire.
{{204987124-0-80432:}}But you escaped.
{{204987124-0-80433:}}How are you involved in the Legion?
{{204987124-0-81459:}}We're pretty close to Valenwood, aren't we?
{{204987124-1-80635:}}Any word from Leramil the Wise?
{{204987124-0-81326:}}Why's that?
{{204987124-0-81175:}}Wisdom? You mean that exchange you had with her before Ithelia entered the portal?
{{204987124-0-80965:}}All right. I'll look for your next facet.
{{204987124-0-80962:}}Do you trust the Scribes of Mora?
{{204987124-1-81931:}}What did she say about Sage's Dream?
{{204987124-0-80609:}}And Haldain Lumber Camp is in this devastated region?
{{204987124-0-78319:}}Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers.
{{204987124-0-78313:}}I'm interested in work. Where do I start?
{{204987124-0-78316:}}Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers.
{{204987124-0-78317:}}Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers.
{{204987124-1-82055:}}What do you make of the Gryphon?
{{204987124-1-82054:}}What do you think about the Indrik?
{{204987124-1-82051:}}What do you think about the Indrik?
{{204987124-1-82050:}}Can you tell me about the Netch?
{{204987124-1-82053:}}What do you think about the Indrik?
{{204987124-1-81277:}}Valenia has a family. A grandchild not much older than Erno. You would take her from them?
{{204987124-2-80345:}}Who's Valenia?
{{204987124-0-79199:}}What was that about an overgrowth?
{{204987124-0-79198:}}You think the Wood Elves can't be trusted?
{{204987124-1-80343:}}What about Fallen-Knives?
{{204987124-1-80342:}}What about Fallen-Knives?
{{204987124-1-80346:}}What about Fallen-Knives?
{{204987124-1-80345:}}Tell me about Big Urm.
{{204987124-1-80344:}}You were a thief?
{{204987124-0-81129:}}I vow to be loyal to others to the end of my days.
{{204987124-0-81120:}}No, what happened to Ithelia? She seemed hurt when I destroyed the Loom, then she changed.
{{204987124-0-81125:}}I vow to be charitable in what lies ahead.
{{204987124-0-79439:}}The couple wants you to gather supplies for their travel. Will you help them?
{{204987124-0-79431:}}You should juggle swords.
{{204987124-0-79432:}}Aetherial alarum? What is this?
{{204987124-0-79436:}}He should pretend to sleep.
{{204987124-0-81181:}}Where's this portal?
{{204987124-0-81959:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-81950:}}Any parts of the library in particular catch your eye?
{{204987124-0-81952:}}Why?
{{204987124-0-81954:}}Then what happened?
{{204987124-0-81955:}}She's interested in Ayleids?
{{204987124-0-81957:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-1-81825:}}I need to investigate Rustwall next.
{{204987124-1-81826:}}I do have a few questions.
{{204987124-0-78607:}}Maybe. Good luck, Toutis.
{{204987124-2-81624:}}What was that name you called your aunt? Agawen?
{{204987124-2-81625:}}You said your families hate each other?
{{204987124-2-82008:}}What do I need to do in Nocturnal's realm?
{{204987124-0-80234:}}If you thought Bella was missing, why not form a search party?
{{204987124-0-80574:}}Do you have a special connection to Laeni and Clendagal?
{{204987124-0-81464:}}So none of them got any of the Vesper Valente?
{{204987124-0-80573:}}Blade dancer?
{{204987124-0-80572:}}I suppose, what's your favorite thing about the Green Pact?
{{204987124-2-80013:}}I'm actually on a quest to help Shalidor recover Eyevea.
{{204987124-0-78699:}}Actually, we found the missing fortune along with a letter from Lady Weatherleah.
{{204987124-1-78860:}}A long journey ahead? What do you mean?
{{204987124-2-80015:}}What exactly is Scribing?
{{204987124-0-78696:}}All right. I'll pour the cure on these victims.
{{204987124-0-81622:}}Then what exactly is the Skein of Secrets showing us?
{{204987124-0-81621:}}See you soon, Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-80972:}}And what happens to Rustwall Estate after that?
{{204987124-0-80974:}}What would you have done if it didn't work?
{{204987124-2-80017:}}Shalidor hasn't mentioned her since we began working together.
{{204987124-0-81082:}}What is the null arca?
{{204987124-0-81083:}}Did you say there are bears in the passage?
{{204987124-0-81080:}}Ithelia didn't just surrender. She agreed to give up her power and leave this reality.
{{204987124-1-81715:}}What exactly is Scribing?
{{204987124-0-80155:}}You aren't coming with me?
{{204987124-0-78958:}}So how do we fix these holes in reality?
{{204987124-0-78950:}}Right. Enjoy the party.
{{204987124-0-78951:}}Right. Enjoy the party.
{{204987124-0-78954:}}All right. Let's go stop Ithelia.
{{204987124-0-79607:}}Go right ahead, then.
{{204987124-0-79604:}}Oh. Don't let me stand in your way.
{{204987124-0-79603:}}You're part Ayleid?
{{204987124-0-79609:}}All right. Anyone in specific you think I should talk to?
{{204987124-0-79608:}}And this fatigue fever is blamed for all these deaths, including your father?
{{204987124-2-79887:}}Can you tell me more about these Luminaries of magic?
{{204987124-2-81661:}}I have some other questions.
{{204987124-0-81635:}}You called Sorilen a Greenspeaker. Tell me about them.
{{204987124-1-80960:}}What are you hoping will happen?
{{204987124-1-80667:}}That's good to hear. Nahlia had a lead to follow as well. Where are the notes?
{{204987124-0-80346:}}Let's talk about something else.
{{204987124-0-80347:}}You were a thief?
{{204987124-0-80344:}}What were you going to say?
{{204987124-0-80345:}}Let's talk about something else.
{{204987124-0-80342:}}Tell me about Big Urm.
{{204987124-0-80343:}}Let's talk about something else.
{{204987124-0-78629:}}There must be some explanation.
{{204987124-0-78620:}}You fired the cook?
{{204987124-0-78626:}}Why is that?
{{204987124-0-78627:}}Is there anyone who would want to hurt <<1>>?
{{204987124-0-79978:}}Only a fragment of the key?
{{204987124-0-79976:}}What am I looking for?
{{204987124-3-81801:}}Can you tell me more about this trial?
{{204987124-1-81502:}}I met Ithelia at the Outcast Inn. I helped her remember herself and acquired the Lamp of Clarity.
{{204987124-0-81629:}}You think Fargrave is Mirrormoor?
{{204987124-1-81506:}}The Order of the Lamp. Can you tell me more about them?
{{204987124-1-81507:}}Why do you think the portal needs more than one person to grant entry?
{{204987124-0-79025:}}He may be a while.
{{204987124-0-79024:}}Hang on. This grate looks like those earlier traps. There may be a mechanism to disarm it somewhere.
{{204987124-0-79023:}}They all came from different directions, and took different amounts of time?
{{204987124-0-79022:}}Living statues?
{{204987124-0-79021:}}Then how do we solve this?
{{204987124-0-79020:}}She strikes me as being very capable.
{{204987124-0-81051:}}I have some questions.
{{204987124-0-81623:}}Why does it represent you to the village?
{{204987124-0-81553:}}You can have the Lamp of Clarity.
{{204987124-2-81275:}}I don't think Hypatia would want this for herself. Or for you.
{{204987124-1-81850:}}What exactly is Scribing?
{{204987124-2-81133:}}I vow to be curious about those I care about.
{{204987124-1-81853:}}Can me tell me more about your Order?
{{204987124-2-80770:}}What's in this jagga you gave me?
{{204987124-1-81106:}}Who is Quatrius Idolus?
{{204987124-0-81583:}}Are you sure you'll be all right on your own?
{{204987124-0-81581:}}But …?
{{204987124-0-79097:}}Tell me about being an investigator.
{{204987124-0-81587:}}Your father still believes in the Dawnway?
{{204987124-0-81584:}}When do you think you'll get married?
{{204987124-0-81589:}}Why does Laeni call you Agawen Ciiril?
{{204987124-0-81588:}}You're proud of Vashabar?
{{204987124-0-79348:}}Who's Commander Merian?
{{204987124-1-80846:}}Why do you think your expedition will succeed?
{{204987124-1-80847:}}Who are you?
{{204987124-0-80689:}}Would you have gone through with the marriage if you knew he was a vampire?
{{204987124-0-80687:}}So what now?
{{204987124-0-80686:}}Take care.
{{204987124-0-80681:}}Another wing taken care of.
{{204987124-0-80680:}}Clever. Does that mean you accept my riddle?
{{204987124-2-82007:}}What do I need to do in Nocturnal's realm?
{{204987124-0-81687:}}What do you know about the anomaly?
{{204987124-0-81794:}}And then what?
{{204987124-0-81795:}}Tell me about that.
{{204987124-0-78758:}}But you said the Skein is showing you places where the Staff of Many Paths is being used.
{{204987124-0-81240:}}Right.
{{204987124-0-81241:}}You want to try and live up to what she did?
{{204987124-0-81243:}}You think the Guild will take to Scribing?
{{204987124-0-81245:}}It was quite the journey, Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-79806:}}You don't have anyone else who could bless your wedding?
{{204987124-1-81739:}}Can't I ask you an impossible riddle right now? Like, what happened to the Dwarves?
{{204987124-1-81734:}}I'd like to talk about the other Luminaries.
{{204987124-0-81656:}}Tell me about Ostumir.
{{204987124-1-79800:}}How did you become marshal to Count Calantius?
{{204987124-1-79805:}}What was that name you called your aunt? Agawen?
{{204987124-1-79808:}}Can you tell me about Vashabar?
{{204987124-0-81428:}}He's going to be selling the things we find here?
{{204987124-0-81429:}}Remind me, what should we be asking about?
{{204987124-0-81007:}}Can you tell me anything about the Ithelia from my reality?
{{204987124-0-81001:}}Why are we sneaking into these realms?
{{204987124-1-81133:}}I vow to be compassionate to those I care about.
{{204987124-0-80008:}}Why do you think the portal needs more than one person to grant entry?
{{204987124-1-78360:}}Oh, you mean Ard Caddach.
{{204987124-0-79689:}}Perhaps.
{{204987124-0-79686:}}I have some thoughts.
{{204987124-0-79684:}}I have some thoughts.
{{204987124-0-79682:}}Do you want to talk about the Molag Bal Paradox again?
{{204987124-0-81855:}}Why wouldn't you be available?
{{204987124-0-81854:}}Why that group?
{{204987124-0-81850:}}What more can you tell me about Ulfsild?
{{204987124-0-81852:}}What do you mean? They knew they wouldn't be together forever?
{{204987124-0-81858:}}Who are the associates you want to bring back?
{{204987124-0-78798:}}I'll see you there.
{{204987124-0-78799:}}The Skein of Secrets. King Nantharion and Ithelia are looking for the Well of Miscarcand.
{{204987124-0-78796:}}He doesn't think any of his people are involved. He asked us to report to him if we learn any more.
{{204987124-0-78794:}}Those vampires recognized you.
{{204987124-0-78795:}}Could Tham still be alive?
{{204987124-0-78793:}}Won't they go warn Balandrus that you're here?
{{204987124-0-78790:}}What are we searching for?
{{204987124-0-81505:}}Tell me about Feldagard Keep.
{{204987124-0-80726:}}You said your family and Clendagal's hate each other?
{{204987124-1-81909:}}I'm not sure how the Luminaries connect to Scribing or the altar.
{{204987124-1-81904:}}Why did you lend your power to the fawn?
{{204987124-1-81902:}}What is the Netch like?
{{204987124-0-81504:}}Should I go to the Outcast Inn before Feldagard Keep?
{{204987124-1-81901:}}Why did you lend your power to the fawn?
{{204987124-0-81226:}}What did the rite do?
{{204987124-0-79594:}}I'll see you two outside the village then.
{{204987124-0-81227:}}Ulfsild created you?
{{204987124-2-81891:}}Where are we?
{{204987124-2-81897:}}Where are we?
{{204987124-0-78728:}}There were some Recollection cultists in the camp.
{{204987124-0-81275:}}I don't believe you. If that were true, you'd have killed Valenia.
{{204987124-0-78974:}}What sort of problems?
{{204987124-0-80988:}}Where are we going to borrow this magic from?
{{204987124-0-81835:}}Tell me about the Outcast Inn.
{{204987124-0-81554:}}You can have the Lamp of Clarity.
{{204987124-1-80775:}}Ulrath was the only legionary to survive. He gave me this report and said he was leaving.
{{204987124-1-80770:}}Do you want Laeni and Clendagal to marry?
{{204987124-2-81506:}}All right, I'm ready to head through that portal.
{{204987124-1-81588:}}Is today the first time you spoke of leaving?
{{204987124-1-81589:}}Do you want Laeni and Clendagal to marry?
{{204987124-1-81582:}}Why do you think breaking the anchors will close the portal?
{{204987124-1-81580:}}Why do you think breaking the anchors will close the portal?
{{204987124-0-78858:}}What's the purpose of the signal fires again?
{{204987124-0-79723:}}Why do you suppose Constable Ulbren suspected a crime?
{{204987124-0-79516:}}Which vineyard?
{{204987124-0-79410:}}How can I help?
{{204987124-0-79415:}}I've got Abolisher. Maybe I can open a portal.
{{204987124-0-79758:}}Probably something like that.
{{204987124-0-80545:}}What can you tell us about the auction?
{{204987124-0-81358:}}All right. Let's warn the king before we go to find the cart the greenspeaker told us about.
{{204987124-1-80572:}}What do you teach the children?
{{204987124-0-81712:}}What was that last exchange between you and Ithelia?
{{204987124-0-81710:}}We can save Curate Gadayn?
{{204987124-1-81623:}}This isn't one of those wildburn seeds, is it?
{{204987124-0-82064:}}Why does it represent you to the village?
{{204987124-0-79140:}}I understand that some Wood Elves here don't follow the Green Pact.
{{204987124-1-80394:}}[Don't Warn Narsis] Don't let me stop you.
{{204987124-2-80574:}}What does it mean to be a spinner?
{{204987124-0-81010:}}Why would you agree to be imprisoned for something you haven't done yet?
{{204987124-0-81012:}}What brought you to this point?
{{204987124-2-81388:}}What happened back there when the knot fractured?
{{204987124-2-82029:}}Can you tell me about yourself?
{{204987124-1-78732:}}What's our next step?
{{204987124-0-78332:}}So all I have to do is find the Mirrormoor champion and kill it?
{{204987124-0-78715:}}Stay safe, Legionary Calvo.
{{204987124-0-80666:}}Maybe we could learn from Mizbi's riddle.
{{204987124-0-80663:}}I'll speak to Nahlia and the Crow, then.
{{204987124-0-81699:}}What do you want to do now?
{{204987124-0-81698:}}Why do you think the portal needs more than one person to grant entry?
{{204987124-1-81880:}}Do all the Luminaries have fables like this?
{{204987124-0-81524:}}Tell me about the Imperial Legion.
{{204987124-0-79442:}}Why would they stay if they can't get married?
{{204987124-1-81472:}}What was Fennorian like before he became a vampire?
{{204987124-1-80591:}}It seems to me like he deserved what happened to him.
{{204987124-0-81925:}}You're selling things, though. Is Chronicler a fancy title for a clerk?
{{204987124-0-81928:}}The Indrik helped you find supplies?
{{204987124-0-81229:}}That does tend to happen to me.
{{204987124-1-81275:}}Hytia would never have wanted this for herself. Or for you.
{{204987124-1-81276:}}Valenia has a family. A grandchild not much older than Erno. You would take her from them?
{{204987124-0-80133:}}Let's go to the Sharp Tooth camp.
{{204987124-0-80132:}}Do you know how we can calm these Goblins down?
{{204987124-0-78693:}}What of the missing fortune?
{{204987124-0-78697:}}He was an imposter. He wanted a cut of the fortune after helping kill Uriel.
{{204987124-0-78695:}}We must have missed something.
{{204987124-0-80447:}}Good luck.
{{204987124-2-79173:}}Why did you call the Ithelia from my path a reflection?
{{204987124-1-81759:}}Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)
{{204987124-0-79668:}}Perhaps.
{{204987124-3-79667:}}You know, I've confronted Molag Bal.
{{204987124-0-79095:}}How does a fortune go missing?
{{204987124-0-79090:}}So what of the imposter?
{{204987124-0-79091:}}And now the cook is dead.
{{204987124-1-80410:}}Are you a Scribe of Mora?
{{204987124-0-78322:}}You must have some theory.
{{204987124-0-78321:}}Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?
{{204987124-0-78320:}}What kinds of tasks do you need help with?
{{204987124-0-78327:}}What sorts of threats are you talking about?
{{204987124-0-78326:}}What do you know about the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-78325:}}Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?
{{204987124-0-78324:}}Who are you exactly?
{{204987124-0-78329:}}What can you tell me about Spinner Urthrendir?
{{204987124-0-78328:}}Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?
{{204987124-1-82008:}}We're stealing creatia from Nocturnal? Where?
{{204987124-1-82009:}}Hermaeus Mora? Where are we stealing his creatia?
{{204987124-1-82007:}}We're stealing creatia from Nocturnal? Where?
{{204987124-7-78324:}}I've been to the Haldain Lumber Camp. The place was devastated.
{{204987124-7-78321:}}I've been to the Haldain Lumber Camp. The place was devastated.
{{204987124-3-82032:}}What do you think of the Indrik?
{{204987124-3-82034:}}Can you tell me more about this trial?
{{204987124-0-80849:}}What about the claw and the tooth-marked plank?
{{204987124-0-80848:}}What happened to the other expeditions?
{{204987124-0-80845:}}The knot can connect two realities?
{{204987124-0-80847:}}Why do you think your expedition will succeed?
{{204987124-0-80846:}}What happened to the other expeditions?
{{204987124-0-80840:}}I'll go speak to Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-79441:}}I came to tell you that Laeni plans to leave the village so she and Clendagal can wed.
{{204987124-0-79440:}}I came to tell you that Clendagal plans to leave the village so he and Laeni can wed.
{{204987124-0-79445:}}One of the villagers mentioned a place called the Wilderhall?
{{204987124-0-79444:}}Ciiril hoped you might convince the couple to stay.
{{204987124-0-79446:}}One of the villagers mentioned I should speak to him, and Spinner Belwelas came through.
{{204987124-0-79449:}}Why does it represent you to the village?
{{204987124-0-79448:}}It was Spinner Belwelas's idea. Ciiril is already gathering the villagers.
{{204987124-2-78995:}}What was that about a new forest?
{{204987124-0-79780:}}She's a knight that uses magic?
{{204987124-0-81926:}}What does a Chronicler do, exactly?
{{204987124-0-81929:}}Tell me more about the threat you perceive here.
{{204987124-2-78994:}}What was that about a new forest?
{{204987124-4-81972:}}Here, take a look at the fable. Do you have suggestions on where I should go?
{{204987124-4-81973:}}Here, take a look at the fable. Do you have suggestions on where I should go?
{{204987124-0-80118:}}He certainly keeps busy.
{{204987124-0-80406:}}Noraine? Your granddaughter?
{{204987124-0-81197:}}I thought I saw some Recollection cultists, too.
{{204987124-0-80239:}}I'll place the items.
{{204987124-0-80232:}}I'll help you find a way to calm the warring Goblins.
{{204987124-0-80231:}}If warring Goblins are so dangerous, why not let the hunter handle it?
{{204987124-0-81191:}}Tell me about the attackers.
{{204987124-0-81192:}}How are you going to help me find the path?
{{204987124-0-81193:}}Why do you think he's dead?
{{204987124-0-79849:}}What are we supposed to do, then?
{{204987124-0-79848:}}The Coldharbour Compact?
{{204987124-0-81613:}}Why are you upset?
{{204987124-0-81611:}}What are you doing?
{{204987124-1-80433:}}Tell me about Feldagard Keep.
{{204987124-1-81740:}}How is coming up with a riddle a trial?
{{204987124-1-81741:}}Can't I ask you an impossible riddle right now? Like, what happened to the Dwarves?
{{204987124-0-82148:}}Hermaeus Mora pulled Gadayn from the Many Paths. Are you sure this is our Gadayn?
{{204987124-0-79778:}}How will you do that?
{{204987124-2-82010:}}What do I need to do in Nocturnal's realm?
{{204987124-0-78920:}}All right. Let's head into the auction.
{{204987124-0-78928:}}It looked like he was using it to conduct the ritual with the wildburn seed.
{{204987124-2-82012:}}What do I need to do in Nocturnal's realm?
{{204987124-0-81449:}}Remind me about House Ravenwatch.
{{204987124-0-81443:}}All right. Ready whenever you are, Leramil.
{{204987124-0-81441:}}Several realities were entangled. Helping Ithelia was the least dangerous thing to do.
{{204987124-2-81849:}}What exactly is Scribing?
{{204987124-1-80537:}}What will happen to Ithelia's minions now?
{{204987124-5-78324:}}Why does a Reach diplomat care about some old, discarded trinkets?
{{204987124-0-81670:}}Your commander was happy?
{{204987124-0-79232:}}Constable Ulbren's notebook indicated that he was planning to talk to you.
{{204987124-0-80377:}}After what happened?
{{204987124-0-80376:}}Why did you lend your power to the fawn?
{{204987124-0-80374:}}You chose your form. Why are you an Indrik?
{{204987124-0-80373:}}If it's so simple why is Scribing a lost art?
{{204987124-0-80372:}}And these challenges all relate to power?
{{204987124-0-80371:}}Why are you having me do these particular challenges?
{{204987124-0-80370:}}We're pretty close to Valenwood, aren't we?
{{204987124-0-78613:}}Do you share Aquilia's doubts about your mother's death?
{{204987124-0-78612:}}You lost your memories?
{{204987124-0-78611:}}What does Pelena think?
{{204987124-0-78610:}}Why are you so suspicious of Uriel?
{{204987124-0-78617:}}Could someone on staff have hurt your mother?
{{204987124-0-78615:}}Is there anyone who would want to hurt your mother?
{{204987124-0-78614:}}So now you remember everything?
{{204987124-0-78619:}}Betu listens to your commands?
{{204987124-0-78618:}}Who found her body?
{{204987124-0-81034:}}So I need to find the key, find the chest, and steal the creatia.
{{204987124-2-78732:}}What's our next step?
{{204987124-3-78638:}}How do we stop Ithelia if we find her?
{{204987124-3-78319:}}You're a legionary?
{{204987124-3-78317:}}You're a legionary?
{{204987124-3-78316:}}You're a legionary?
{{204987124-1-81943:}}Why would an Ithelia lose control of her powers?
{{204987124-2-81893:}}Where are we?
{{204987124-1-81946:}}Why does Hermaeus Mora see you as a threat?
{{204987124-2-80726:}}Why can't you just get married? Ignore what your fathers think.
{{204987124-2-81890:}}Where are we?
{{204987124-0-81025:}}Is there anything else you can tell me about the Lucent Citadel?
{{204987124-2-81996:}}What should I know about Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-81178:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-81177:}}All right. I'll head for the sites Scruut marked on my map now.
{{204987124-2-81991:}}How did you and the Gryphon become friends?
{{204987124-1-78259:}}I'll head into Legion's Rest and see if I can find your wine and Lazen.
{{204987124-0-79372:}}You look injured.
{{204987124-1-80835:}}Do you have a special connection to Laeni and Clendagal?
{{204987124-1-80834:}}Why do you tend the Wilderhall?
{{204987124-1-80836:}}Have you ever read this fable before?
{{204987124-2-82050:}}What do you think about the Indrik?
{{204987124-2-82051:}}What do you make of the Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-80650:}}What do you want me to do for your trial?
{{204987124-0-80651:}}Understood. I'll solve some of your riddles.
{{204987124-0-80656:}}Thank you, Julian.
{{204987124-0-80657:}}Thank you, Irnard.
{{204987124-3-80433:}}The report we found in Hoperoot, tell me about that.
{{204987124-2-81656:}}What have you been up to since we last met?
{{204987124-0-81231:}}I'll talk to her about it.
{{204987124-0-81230:}}Understood. Nahlia and I will seek it out.
{{204987124-0-81237:}}I see.
{{204987124-0-81238:}}Hmm.
{{204987124-0-78700:}}Any idea where to find Lord Valente's laboratory?
{{204987124-0-78703:}}Can you tell me more about Leftwheal?
{{204987124-0-78704:}}We can still help them.
{{204987124-2-81342:}}What are Mr. Klauser's options?
{{204987124-0-81617:}}The Netch wanted to explain things to you itself.
{{204987124-0-81593:}}How did you become Count Calantius's marshal?
{{204987124-2-80572:}}Can you tell me a bit more about greenspeakers?
{{204987124-0-81596:}}Who are you exactly?
{{204987124-1-81991:}}How were you able to get into the Gryphon's domain if the door was closed?
{{204987124-1-81997:}}Are you a Luminary, like the Gryphon?
{{204987124-1-81996:}}You mentioned Quatrius Idolus. Who's that?
{{204987124-0-80107:}}So you're concerned about the count's claim to that land?
{{204987124-1-78834:}}Grivier can't be forgiven. Leave him here. Maybe he'll get loose before the vampires return.
{{204987124-0-82417:}}Is the Mages Guild keeping this a secret?
{{204987124-0-82418:}}I'll help Votary Nahlia assess this magical anomaly.
{{204987124-1-80294:}}Why are the Luminary keys hidden like this?
{{204987124-0-81037:}}How do I get the creatia?
{{204987124-0-80929:}}What else can you tell me about these instabilities?
{{204987124-0-80921:}}If you say so, Scruut.
{{204987124-0-80926:}}What do you mean that your power abandoned you?
{{204987124-1-79000:}}Tell me about these sites you want me to investigate.
{{204987124-1-79001:}}I'm a necromancer, you know.
{{204987124-1-79002:}}Why does the ritual need to be stopped?
{{204987124-1-79007:}}I want to know more about the Recollection.
{{204987124-0-79666:}}Tell me more about Legionary Calvo.
{{204987124-0-79662:}}Is there some way I can help?
{{204987124-1-79021:}}I mean, doesn't this remind you of what we encountered in Veloth Tomb in Vvardenfell?
{{204987124-0-80073:}}You didn't know Lord Gallio Valente was a vampire?
{{204987124-1-78353:}}Who are you exactly?
{{204987124-1-80489:}}How long have you been working at the Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-81967:}}Her notes are already visible without the lens?
{{204987124-1-80483:}}How long have you been working at the Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-79651:}}Sophists and mystics?
{{204987124-0-79652:}}What's the debate about?
{{204987124-0-79657:}}Abibon-Gora. That's far from Skingrad.
{{204987124-0-81808:}}How are you going to avoid the Recollection forces?
{{204987124-0-81806:}}I'll search for the wildburn seed with Beragon.
{{204987124-0-81802:}}What happens if we don't find all your facets?
{{204987124-0-81803:}}What happens if we don't find all your facets?
{{204987124-0-81800:}}Are you talking about her husband? Shalidor?
{{204987124-0-80936:}}Did you hide another page from the fable here?
{{204987124-0-81412:}}I still plan on searching Legion's Rest for the missing wine.
{{204987124-0-81518:}}Right. Let's go.
{{204987124-2-81593:}}What should I know about Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-81512:}}What do you think of the Indrik?
{{204987124-0-81514:}}How do you know this mortal?
{{204987124-0-81515:}}Why is this the last time?
{{204987124-2-79000:}}How do we stop Ithelia if we find her?
{{204987124-1-78336:}}How did you become Count Calantius's marshal?
{{204987124-1-81929:}}What can you tell me about this inn?
{{204987124-1-81465:}}What does the art of Scribing mean to you?
{{204987124-0-81482:}}But that's not true now?
{{204987124-0-81483:}}You seem an odd pairing.
{{204987124-0-81481:}}Why are you and the Fox companions?
{{204987124-0-81486:}}Why are you and the Fox companions?
{{204987124-0-81487:}}Why did you choose to be a Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-81484:}}What are you going to do with the magic we steal?
{{204987124-0-81485:}}How were you born from that magic?
{{204987124-0-79070:}}You're lucky to have her.
{{204987124-0-79072:}}Rock solid. That's one way of putting it.
{{204987124-0-78677:}}Pelena was here? She said she forgot about having tea that morning.
{{204987124-0-78676:}}Edric is dead. He left this note confessing to poisoning <<1>>'s tea.
{{204987124-0-78808:}}Any sign of King Nantharion here?
{{204987124-0-78805:}}I met Ithelia at the Outcast Inn. I helped her remember herself and acquired the Lamp of Clarity.
{{204987124-0-78737:}}The Recollection is attacking?
{{204987124-1-81101:}}Have you learned anything else about Ulfsild or the Gryphon in your research?
{{204987124-0-79851:}}There must be something else we can do, too.
{{204987124-1-81897:}}You mentioned the other Luminaries. What can you tell me about them?
{{204987124-3-80342:}}Let's talk about something else.
{{204987124-0-78274:}}Very well, I'll search Fyrelight for your dowry.
{{204987124-1-81891:}}What are you, exactly? What are the Luminaries?
{{204987124-1-78402:}}Who are you exactly?
{{204987124-0-79504:}}Amaurel thought you could court her properly. No dowry.
{{204987124-0-80529:}}All right, but why these locations specifically?
{{204987124-0-79505:}}What does the rite do?
{{204987124-0-79507:}}All right. I'll see you later then.
{{204987124-0-81729:}}Thanks. I'll let you know if I need help with a riddle.
{{204987124-0-81728:}}Thanks. I'll let you know if I need help with a riddle.
{{204987124-0-81726:}}I like riddles too.
{{204987124-0-81725:}}What are you going to do about the remaining Daedra and Recollection cultists beneath Rustwall?
{{204987124-0-81723:}}You mentioned a Wood Elf in Skingrad?
{{204987124-0-81720:}}Who is the Lady of Heaven?
{{204987124-0-80894:}}The Scholarium is underneath this sanctuary?
{{204987124-0-80895:}}Her notes are already visible without the lens?
{{204987124-0-82038:}}I have a few other questions.
{{204987124-0-82039:}}What do you need?
{{204987124-0-82037:}}I have a few other questions.
{{204987124-0-82034:}}Were you talking about her husband? Shalidor?
{{204987124-0-82032:}}I have a few other questions.
{{204987124-0-82033:}}I have a few other questions.
{{204987124-0-82030:}}What do you think about the Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-82031:}}I have a few other questions.
{{204987124-0-80678:}}The dragon said I needed to understand her mind. You don't think she'll be able to work that out?
{{204987124-0-81740:}}Can I ask you questions, to understand you better?
{{204987124-0-80836:}}Even if I dispel the wards, do you really think I'll find a clue to the next set?
{{204987124-0-81320:}}I'll just pay your tab. How big is it?
{{204987124-0-81324:}}The ring is just a ring. Your actions are proof to the Divines.
{{204987124-0-81006:}}Can you describe the Many Paths?
{{204987124-0-81004:}}Can you describe the Many Paths?
{{204987124-0-81005:}}What do you mean intentionally so?
{{204987124-0-81002:}}And you control the Many Paths?
{{204987124-0-81000:}}I see. Where are these thin connections you mentioned?
{{204987124-0-79520:}}The Emblem of the Last King?
{{204987124-0-79521:}}All right. Where do we start?
{{204987124-0-79528:}}I know where there's some vineyards.
{{204987124-0-81887:}}How will that open your door?
{{204987124-0-81885:}}I'll place the fable on the dais, then.
{{204987124-0-81880:}}I'm not sure how the Luminaries connect to Scribing or the altar.
{{204987124-0-80282:}}I'm good for it.
{{204987124-0-80280:}}An echo about the Dragon? Where did you find it?
{{204987124-0-80286:}}Where do I start?
{{204987124-0-80754:}}I'll head into the cave and have a look.
{{204987124-0-80751:}}What did it say?
{{204987124-0-80752:}}Say what you want to say while there's still time.
{{204987124-0-79898:}}What do we do next?
{{204987124-0-79897:}}And I can Scribe more grimoires, shape new skills?
{{204987124-0-79895:}}And that's what I just did, Scribing? Shaping magic?
{{204987124-2-81698:}}What else can you tell me about the Knights of the Lamp?
{{204987124-0-81964:}}Her notes are already visible without the lens?
{{204987124-0-81961:}}An intelligent fox stole the fable pages?
{{204987124-0-81962:}}An intelligent fox stole the fable pages?
{{204987124-0-81969:}}You said he lost it to Sheogorath in a wager?
{{204987124-1-81440:}}What have you been up to since the last time we met, Fennorian?
{{204987124-1-81449:}}I'm a vampire. Is that going to be a problem?
{{204987124-1-81686:}}Why have I never heard of the Order of the Lamp before?
{{204987124-1-81689:}}What do you know about the anomaly?
{{204987124-2-80847:}}What are you doing here, Keshargo?
{{204987124-0-82007:}}Where are we stealing creatia from Mehrunes Dagon?
{{204987124-0-82005:}}I see. Where are these thin connections you mentioned?
{{204987124-0-82009:}}Where are we stealing creatia from Mehrunes Dagon?
{{204987124-1-79607:}}As a necromancer, I know what you're doing is dangerous.
{{204987124-1-79604:}}You probably shouldn't do something so dangerous as a first try.
{{204987124-0-82514:}}Tell me about fatigue fever.
{{204987124-0-82511:}}Less cordial? What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-82513:}}What was that about the ranch and the quarry being less coridal?
{{204987124-0-82512:}}Why do you think Constable Ulbren was investigating an illness?
{{204987124-0-81378:}}So which other brazier do I need to light up?
{{204987124-0-81379:}}Ah, I see. Thanks Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-81374:}}Apocrypha's a pretty big place. How will we find her?
{{204987124-0-81376:}}All right. I'll go with you to Apocrypha and use the Skein of Secrets.
{{204987124-0-81377:}}Why is Ithelia doing that? If reality is destroyed, she will be too.
{{204987124-0-81370:}}The last Ithelia claimed that the Lamp of Clarity wasn't actually helping you.
{{204987124-0-82006:}}You're going to follow your nose to this creatia?
{{204987124-0-79289:}}The Skein of Secrets?
{{204987124-0-79280:}}And something went wrong?
{{204987124-0-79287:}}How exactly do these relics work?
{{204987124-0-79285:}}Keeps things interesting.
{{204987124-0-79753:}}And you haven't figured out what Ithelia tried to show you before she departed?
{{204987124-0-78578:}}Grander deserves to know the truth.
{{204987124-0-78579:}}What should I tell him?
{{204987124-0-78573:}}So you think the deserters came looking for Imperial gold?
{{204987124-0-15219:}}I'll come in now.
{{204987124-0-79238:}}We're looking into the deaths related to fatigue fever.
{{204987124-0-81356:}}Warn him about what exactly?
{{204987124-0-81354:}}Yes, I completed the legionary's mission. The signal fires are blazing.
{{204987124-0-79233:}}What's your role in the West Weald Legion?
{{204987124-0-81719:}}You duel people in Tribute?
{{204987124-0-79237:}}So your business hasn't suffered due to fatigue fever?
{{204987124-0-78825:}}Tham was here?
{{204987124-2-81003:}}I'm curious about a different topic.
{{204987124-0-80350:}}Why draw that line?
{{204987124-1-79471:}}Tell me about Legionary Calvo.
{{204987124-0-80046:}}How will that open your door?
{{204987124-0-80040:}}How did you get all these Elves to follow you?
{{204987124-0-78376:}}What can you tell me about Lord Gallio Valente?
{{204987124-0-78377:}}Haldain's dead. I found these near his body. He wanted you to have them.
{{204987124-0-78370:}}Everyone in House Ravenwatch is a vampire?
{{204987124-0-78371:}}And Gallio Valente is a vampire?
{{204987124-0-78372:}}Lord Valente invited his servants to attend the auction?
{{204987124-1-82037:}}Why do you want Nahlia to assist me on my trial?
{{204987124-1-82036:}}You've mentioned Ulfsild several times. What did she mean to you?
{{204987124-1-82034:}}Can we talk about the Luminaries?
{{204987124-1-82033:}}What do you think of the Indrik?
{{204987124-1-82032:}}What do you think about the Gryphon?
{{204987124-1-82031:}}What do you think of the Indrik?
{{204987124-1-82030:}}What do you make of the Dragon?
{{204987124-1-82038:}}How do you know this mortal I'm going to help?
{{204987124-2-79688:}}I think this is all very confusing.
{{204987124-0-79135:}}The Dawnway?
{{204987124-0-79137:}}Dawnwood? Valenwood? King Nantharion?
{{204987124-0-79136:}}Tell me more about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-0-79130:}}It was a pleasure to work with you, Elfbetta.
{{204987124-0-79139:}}You just decided to found a kingdom in West Weald?
{{204987124-0-79138:}}This corruption and strange energy you sensed. Do you know what it is?
{{204987124-2-81918:}}What do you know about the vineyard and winery?
{{204987124-1-81670:}}The Archmagister is going to visit the Scholarium?
{{204987124-1-81671:}}Why didn't you tell us you were a Luminary sooner?
{{204987124-0-80814:}}Curate Gadayn is fine. He can't wait to see you.
{{204987124-1-81674:}}Why didn't you tell us you were a Luminary sooner?
{{204987124-1-81675:}}Are you going to stay here with Nahlia?
{{204987124-0-80810:}}I'll try, Netch. Thank you.
{{204987124-0-80811:}}Have I earned your respect? Your support for my Scribing journey?
{{204987124-1-79139:}}You don't approve of Queen Ayrenn's leadership?
{{204987124-2-81689:}}What is her title, Votary?
{{204987124-2-81683:}}Who is Saint Alessia?
{{204987124-2-80371:}}What are you, exactly? What are the Luminaries?
{{204987124-2-80374:}}You chose your form. Why are you an Indrik?
{{204987124-2-81974:}}How is that fox the Gryphon's soft spot?
{{204987124-2-81975:}}Here, take a look at the fable. Do you have suggestions on where I should go?
{{204987124-2-81976:}}Even if I dispel the wards, do you really think I'll find a clue to the next set?
{{204987124-0-81403:}}The Luminaries of Magic?
{{204987124-0-81400:}}That's not all?
{{204987124-0-81401:}}Interesting.
{{204987124-0-80207:}}Why is the Recollection seeking the relics now?
{{204987124-0-80209:}}But Ithelia saw different reflections of herself when we traveled the Many Paths, Scruut.
{{204987124-0-81404:}}How do we know they'll be willing to share their strength with the altar again?
{{204987124-0-81405:}}Do all the Luminaries have fables like this?
{{204987124-0-81409:}}Do you know who might want to target the caravan?
{{204987124-1-79762:}}So, Beragon Sharp-Dagger?
{{204987124-2-80945:}}Eyevea has returned to Nirn. I helped Shalidor to reclaim the island.
{{204987124-0-79816:}}You're proud of Vashabar?
{{204987124-0-79817:}}How were these buildings created?
{{204987124-0-79812:}}You said your families hate each other?
{{204987124-0-79813:}}They don't approve of your marriage because of their views?
{{204987124-0-79810:}}You said your families hate each other?
{{204987124-0-80999:}}How are we going to do that?
{{204987124-0-80998:}}Let's find Greenspeaker Sorilen and investigate this seed.
{{204987124-0-80992:}}What are you hoping will happen?
{{204987124-0-80997:}}Yes, here you go.
{{204987124-0-80996:}}Yes, here you go.
{{204987124-1-80796:}}What's the Dawnway?
{{204987124-1-80799:}}What's the Dawnway?
{{204987124-3-80343:}}You were a thief?
{{204987124-0-81440:}}Tell me about House Ravenwatch.
{{204987124-1-78585:}}Remind me, what's so special about the wine?
{{204987124-2-80532:}}What about my allies. They helped stop Ithelia. Can't they remember what happened, too?
{{204987124-2-79684:}}What are Agmund's thoughts on it?
{{204987124-1-81207:}}That sounds difficult.
{{204987124-0-79201:}}You mentioned the Many Paths. What are those?
{{204987124-1-80981:}}How am I supposed to get your facets to return to you?
{{204987124-1-80983:}}Why were you experimenting with Daedric magic?
{{204987124-1-80676:}}Time.
{{204987124-0-80412:}}What's the arcane knot?
{{204987124-0-80413:}}You don't know if the null arca works?
{{204987124-0-80410:}}What were you doing for the expedition?
{{204987124-0-80411:}}She said you would know what happened here.
{{204987124-0-80414:}}What's the null arca?
{{204987124-0-80415:}}<Enter Lucent Citadel.>
{{204987124-1-80615:}}Anything else I should know about the Many Paths?
{{204987124-1-80616:}}Who are you exactly?
{{204987124-0-81436:}}Where are we going to find something of Mephala's here in Apocrypha?
{{204987124-1-81560:}}Why are you so happy?
{{204987124-1-81568:}}You mentioned something about Wood Elves?
{{204987124-1-81569:}}Noraine? Your granddaughter?
{{204987124-0-81068:}}Can I ask you some questions?
{{204987124-0-78952:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-2-81440:}}Tell me more about the invitation you found.
{{204987124-2-81895:}}Thanks for telling me about yourself.
{{204987124-1-79949:}}You said no Bosmer who honors the Green would deal with a wildburn seed. What about Sorilen?
{{204987124-0-78826:}}We'll see if we can find Grivier.
{{204987124-1-81583:}}You're certain no one else from the cohort survived?
{{204987124-4-78324:}}Why is it so important that I destroy these gala invitations?
{{204987124-4-78321:}}Why is it so important that I destroy these gala invitations?
{{204987124-1-81011:}}Can you tell me anything about the Ithelia from my reality?
{{204987124-1-78260:}}I'll head into Legion's Rest and see if I can find your wine and Lazen.
{{204987124-0-81973:}}Can you tell me more about Eyevea?
{{204987124-0-81970:}}Have you learned anything else about Ulfsild or the Gryphon in your research?
{{204987124-0-81971:}}Have you learned anything else about Ulfsild or the Gryphon in your research?
{{204987124-0-81976:}}Can you tell me more about Eyevea?
{{204987124-0-81974:}}Can you tell me more about Eyevea?
{{204987124-0-81975:}}How is that fox the Gryphon's soft spot?
{{204987124-0-80591:}}I did try to warn him about rushing into things.
{{204987124-0-80599:}}And why's that?
{{204987124-0-80598:}}A letter I found suggested the next wildburn will awaken wellsprings of power, whatever that means.
{{204987124-1-81849:}}Can you tell me more about these Luminaries of magic?
{{204987124-0-80624:}}You think Tham is going to stay a vampire?
{{204987124-0-80627:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-80626:}}But they were responsible for Dawnwood and the Wildburn.
{{204987124-1-81841:}}Anything else I should know about the Many Paths?
{{204987124-2-81609:}}Can you tell me a bit more about greenspeakers?
{{204987124-1-80008:}}What else can you tell me about this place?
{{204987124-2-81687:}}What else can you tell me about Nahlia?
{{204987124-0-80967:}}Why is it so dangerous?
{{204987124-0-80964:}}All right. I'll get you some West Weald Wallop.
{{204987124-0-80963:}}So the threat here is over?
{{204987124-0-80960:}}Why don't you go up to the lights?
{{204987124-0-80961:}}How do we get the knot to the null arca?
{{204987124-1-81708:}}I'd like to hear more about you.
{{204987124-1-79336:}}Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?
{{204987124-1-81625:}}Why can't you just get married? Ignore what your fathers think.
{{204987124-1-78805:}}I fought off Shardmarshal Vargas at Feldagard Keep and acquired the blade Abolisher.
{{204987124-0-80919:}}You said you had reports of more Shardborn incursions?
{{204987124-1-81732:}}Why are you so focused on riddles and the mind?
{{204987124-2-80829:}}What do you teach the children?
{{204987124-0-78973:}}But what about the Ithelias I met on the Many Paths? They were each different from each other.
{{204987124-0-78978:}}How do we do that?
{{204987124-0-79595:}}What about a symbol for Laeni?
{{204987124-0-79593:}}Sure. What are you thinking?
{{204987124-0-81834:}}Can you tell me about the cracked sky?
{{204987124-0-82117:}}You're going to help us carry out this plan, right?
{{204987124-0-80702:}}I see.
{{204987124-0-80701:}}I'll speak to Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-78672:}}I didn't say he killed himself.
{{204987124-2-78321:}}What can you tell me about the Haldain Lumber Camp?
{{204987124-2-78324:}}What should I know about tharrikers?
{{204987124-2-78329:}}What can you tell me about tharrikers?
{{204987124-0-80667:}}That's good to hear. Where are the notes?
{{204987124-0-79618:}}Could you tell me my fortune?
{{204987124-0-81645:}}Are you really going to try to find Legionary Ulrath?
{{204987124-3-79850:}}I'm not sure I understand how Ithelia escaped.
{{204987124-1-78638:}}Why do they call you Leramil the Wise?
{{204987124-1-78639:}}How do we stop Ithelia if we find her?
{{204987124-1-78635:}}I stopped the Recollection and Shardmarshal Vargas from using Rustwall Estate to invade Skingrad.
{{204987124-0-81972:}}Can you tell me more about Eyevea?
{{204987124-1-80112:}}I'm a necromancer, you know.
{{204987124-0-81874:}}All right, I'll use the lens and find the Indrik's wards.
{{204987124-0-80322:}}Oil barricade, set barricade on fire, launch ballista bolts at Daedra. Got it.
{{204987124-0-80326:}}The winery and the alchemical laboratory are downstairs. I found the key.
{{204987124-0-80492:}}I can take your report to the captain.
{{204987124-0-80490:}}Let's go to Gray's Hollow then.
{{204987124-0-80491:}}Captain Dartorius said she led the Daedra away after you attacked her.
{{204987124-0-80497:}}Any idea why she came to Ostumir?
{{204987124-0-80495:}}Do you think the ground shaking and the wildburn seed are connected?
{{204987124-0-81544:}}This turned out to be quite the patrol, Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-81542:}}You seem confident.
{{204987124-1-80114:}}Why does the ritual need to be stopped?
{{204987124-3-78329:}}What else can you tell me about Hessedaz the Baleful?
{{204987124-0-79916:}}Let's go find a way into the keep.
{{204987124-0-79914:}}Is there anything unusual about either Lord or Lady Valente?
{{204987124-0-81979:}}And how do you know Beragon?
{{204987124-0-79001:}}How can we stop the ritual?
{{204987124-0-79000:}}I've already been to a place you mentioned.
{{204987124-0-79002:}}How can we stop the ritual?
{{204987124-0-79005:}}Leramil is grieving. Can't you tell me what to do, Scruut?
{{204987124-0-79007:}}What else should I know about Elenglynn?
{{204987124-0-79008:}}Why would the Recollection be interested in Ayleid ruins?
{{204987124-0-81525:}}Tell me about Tribune Alea Idolus.
{{204987124-2-80980:}}How am I supposed to get your facets to return to you?
{{204987124-0-78837:}}How about you? Are you ready?
{{204987124-0-78834:}}Grivier deserves to be punished, but his family doesn't. Let him go so he can help them.
{{204987124-0-78833:}}Maybe we can use the Skein of Secrets to track them to Miscarcand.
{{204987124-0-78832:}}So we head into the mine?
{{204987124-0-78831:}}Why are the vampires stockpiling weapons?
{{204987124-0-78830:}}What about Tham? Your wife said he was with you. And where is Balandrus hiding out?
{{204987124-1-79797:}}Can you tell where it leads?
{{204987124-1-81678:}}You created a Tribute deck?
{{204987124-0-78898:}}And you're sure you're no longer a vampire?
{{204987124-1-80666:}}Maybe we could learn from Mizbi's riddle. And the Crow told me about some notes Ulfsild left behind.
{{204987124-0-80552:}}What is the Wilderhall?
{{204987124-0-79492:}}I can do that. Who should I speak to?
{{204987124-0-79496:}}All right, I'll see if Gundelion and Malaniel would be willing to help.
{{204987124-0-80756:}}Maybe. Why do you think the Netch drew you into its trial?
{{204987124-0-80558:}}What sorts of dreams?
{{204987124-1-79700:}}Who are you exactly?
{{204987124-1-78400:}}Who are you exactly?
{{204987124-1-80862:}}Why did you wait until now to suggest this?
{{204987124-0-80750:}}What did you say to him?
{{204987124-1-80864:}}Why haven't Laeni and Clendagal already performed the rite?
{{204987124-1-80865:}}Why did you wait until now to suggest this?
{{204987124-0-79336:}}Remind me who you are again.
{{204987124-0-80519:}}She never knew what happened to you?
{{204987124-0-80518:}}She never knew what happened to you?
{{204987124-0-80515:}}Are you going to honor her request?
{{204987124-0-80513:}}How did you get turned into a vampire?
{{204987124-0-80512:}}How does Ursilia know you?
{{204987124-0-80511:}}All right, I'll look for Lord Valente's office inside the manor.
{{204987124-0-81268:}}Tell me more about the Echonir.
{{204987124-1-80083:}}What do you think is going on?
{{204987124-0-78993:}}What was that about a new forest?
{{204987124-1-81683:}}You created a Tribute deck?
{{204987124-1-81685:}}Who is Saint Alessia?
{{204987124-1-81687:}}Why have I never heard of the Order of the Lamp before?
{{204987124-3-82009:}}What do I have to do in Hermaeus Mora's realm?
{{204987124-2-80557:}}What drew you here, Leramil?
{{204987124-0-82008:}}Hermaeus Mora? Where are we stealing his creatia?
{{204987124-0-78260:}}Earlier, you mentioned Lazen. Who is that?
{{204987124-0-82011:}}I've worked with Hermaeus Mora.
{{204987124-0-81734:}}Why did you choose to be a dragon?
{{204987124-0-81737:}}Tears in the fabric of reality. It sounds so metaphorical.
{{204987124-0-81732:}}I'd like to talk about the other Luminaries.
{{204987124-0-80655:}}Thank you, Llaren.
{{204987124-0-78269:}}Here's the wine I recovered from Legion's Rest.
{{204987124-1-79822:}}I want to know more about the Recollection.
{{204987124-1-79823:}}I want to know more about the Recollection.
{{204987124-0-80938:}}I'll go down and look, then.
{{204987124-0-80036:}}Yes, absolutely.
{{204987124-0-78821:}}Should I go there before I investigate the Outcast Inn?
{{204987124-1-78881:}}Ithelia found her way to the Outcast Inn after she arrived in West Weald. I met her there.
{{204987124-1-78880:}}What do you make of King Nantharion's plans?
{{204987124-0-78402:}}Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?
{{204987124-0-81062:}}She understands you like no one else can.
{{204987124-0-78400:}}Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?
{{204987124-0-78401:}}Why do you call them Ayleid ruins?
{{204987124-2-82054:}}Can you tell me about the Netch?
{{204987124-0-78409:}}Tell me about the squad of legionaries that never returned.
{{204987124-0-80089:}}I accept this gift, Indrik.
{{204987124-0-80088:}}Nahlia has returned from the Mages Guild?
{{204987124-0-80081:}}How do you study goblins?
{{204987124-0-80080:}}All right. I'll keep my eyes open.
{{204987124-0-80083:}}What do you expect to find at the Bitterfish camp?
{{204987124-0-80082:}}How are we going to be able to stop the Goblin war without disturbing them?
{{204987124-0-80085:}}And what's your role exactly?
{{204987124-0-80084:}}What does that mean for my Scribing?
{{204987124-0-80087:}}You think this is your fault?
{{204987124-0-80086:}}What sort of demands?
{{204987124-0-79519:}}All right. Where do we start?
{{204987124-0-79518:}}What associates?
{{204987124-0-79673:}}You're a legionary?
{{204987124-0-78267:}}What will you do with him?
{{204987124-1-81968:}}Why do you think Ulfsild wrote down so little about herself?
{{204987124-0-80708:}}All right. I'll start there.
{{204987124-0-80709:}}What's going on?
{{204987124-0-80707:}}How should I find the real fable?
{{204987124-0-80704:}}Thank you, Dragon.
{{204987124-0-80703:}}All right. Thank you Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-80700:}}Good idea, I'll talk to the Crow.
{{204987124-0-82047:}}Is there anything else I should know?
{{204987124-0-82046:}}Can the Lamp of Clarity or Abolisher help us with this?
{{204987124-0-80658:}}Thank you, Crow.
{{204987124-1-80769:}}Why were you so quick to help the couple?
{{204987124-1-80768:}}Why were you so quick to help the couple?
{{204987124-0-81548:}}The Staff of Many Paths? Didn't Shardmarshal Vargas give that to Nantharion at Hoperoot?
{{204987124-0-80654:}}What do you think about the Riddle of Battle?
{{204987124-0-79477:}}He can't marry Laeni and support the village at the same time?
{{204987124-0-79472:}}Well, enjoy the rest of your jagga. Thank you for talking to me.
{{204987124-0-79688:}}Perhaps Molag Bal represents the clash of free will and fate, and is himself suffering.
{{204987124-5-78321:}}What should I know about tharrikers?
{{204987124-0-81918:}}Tell me about House Ravenwatch.
{{204987124-0-81919:}}Tell me about House Ravenwatch.
{{204987124-0-81236:}}All right, I'll keep the Echonir handy.
{{204987124-0-81313:}}New forest?
{{204987124-0-81317:}}I'll help you learn more about the wildburn seed.
{{204987124-5-78329:}}What can you tell me about Oakenclaw?
{{204987124-0-81387:}}What are you doing to do with the Arcane Knot?
{{204987124-0-81386:}}What if there wasn't enough time?
{{204987124-0-81380:}}I'll help you find the missing Legion cohort.
{{204987124-0-81382:}}Do you think you can stabilize the arcane knot?
{{204987124-0-79081:}}You really care about Betu, don't you?
{{204987124-0-79083:}}And Betu?
{{204987124-0-79085:}}How do you feel about this arrangement?
{{204987124-0-81388:}}Do you trust the Scribes of Mora?
{{204987124-0-79086:}}But we just solved a crime!
{{204987124-0-79685:}}I have some thoughts.
{{204987124-0-81836:}}Did you always want to be an innkeep?
{{204987124-0-81055:}}I have some questions about your facets.
{{204987124-0-80163:}}You'd write about this?
{{204987124-0-81832:}}I'll go get water from the well for you.
{{204987124-0-79704:}}Between your coin and your life, I think you made out with the best outcome possible.
{{204987124-0-79702:}}Did you see what had called them here?
{{204987124-0-79703:}}The baroness evacuated you?
{{204987124-0-79700:}}Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?
{{204987124-0-79701:}}You were lucky to make it out.
{{204987124-1-80959:}}How will I know what the arcane knot looks like?
{{204987124-0-80179:}}Remind me. What's happening in West Weald?
{{204987124-0-78315:}}Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers.
{{204987124-1-79423:}}She should start in the back.
{{204987124-0-81665:}}Do you know why Greenspeaker Sorilen asked you to meet here?
{{204987124-2-82109:}}Is this place part of the Scholarium?
{{204987124-1-78596:}}He's mingling, but I can pass along a message if you want.
{{204987124-0-82017:}}Tell me more about the Echonir.
{{204987124-0-82013:}}I've fought against Dagon before.
{{204987124-0-78385:}}And?
{{204987124-0-78384:}}What do you think of the grapes we examined and the dead death hound?
{{204987124-0-78386:}}And this is bad?
{{204987124-0-78381:}}You're investigating Lady Weatherleah's death?
{{204987124-0-78382:}}A missing fortune? A long-lost son?
{{204987124-0-81384:}}Why didn't you stay at the camp?
{{204987124-2-79850:}}Why do they call you Leramil the Wise?
{{204987124-0-81771:}}I'll help you investigate the suspicious deaths in Ontus.
{{204987124-0-81776:}}Sunnamere is a guild hall?
{{204987124-0-81777:}}Can you tell me more about the Order of the Lamp?
{{204987124-0-81778:}}The order is fading away?
{{204987124-0-81779:}}What do you know about the anomaly?
{{204987124-1-80557:}}Tell me more about the threat you perceive here.
{{204987124-1-81609:}}What's your favorite thing about the Green Pact?
{{204987124-1-81608:}}What's your favorite thing about the Green Pact?
{{204987124-0-80829:}}Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town.
{{204987124-0-80821:}}Interesting.
{{204987124-0-79168:}}All right, I'll get the lamp.
{{204987124-0-79167:}}I'll ask the innkeeper to make a Sage's Dream for you.
{{204987124-0-79164:}}What are the Many Paths?
{{204987124-0-79165:}}You said the inn drew you to it?
{{204987124-0-79163:}}I'll go look for sugar in the cellar.
{{204987124-0-79160:}}What can you substitute for those ingredients?
{{204987124-0-82080:}}Did his letter say anything else that can help with our investigation?
{{204987124-0-78811:}}Where does the path to the north lead?
{{204987124-0-78813:}}All right. Follow me.
{{204987124-0-78814:}}You think the Skein of Secrets is beyond those doors?
{{204987124-0-78817:}}What do you suggest?
{{204987124-0-79967:}}Is there anything else I need to know?
{{204987124-2-81901:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-2-81903:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-2-81902:}}How would you describe the Gryphon?
{{204987124-3-82008:}}What do I have to do in Hermaeus Mora's realm?
{{204987124-1-81861:}}Can me tell me more about your Order?
{{204987124-0-80256:}}I can ask Pim about the knife. Maybe she knows.
{{204987124-0-80251:}}Then what is the knife doing here?
{{204987124-0-80787:}}Then return to Suran. You can still reach him.
{{204987124-0-80784:}}He was supposed to be promoted?
{{204987124-0-80785:}}He's with you right now in Suran.
{{204987124-0-80782:}}The ink will connect you to the soul fragments?
{{204987124-0-80780:}}And why did Ulrath attack you?
{{204987124-0-80781:}}I'm ready. Good luck, Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-80789:}}Tell me about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-0-78774:}}You really don't remember the forgotten Daedric Prince?
{{204987124-2-82105:}}How did the Luminaries help her with Scribing?
{{204987124-2-82107:}}Why did Ulfsild develop Scribing?
{{204987124-2-82100:}}How did the Luminaries help her with Scribing?
{{204987124-0-79828:}}The Lamp of Clarity led us to two ingredients. I think the final ingredient is here.
{{204987124-0-79826:}}I'll get the harkfruit.
{{204987124-0-79824:}}This Lamp of Clarity opened the way. It's leading us to Sage's Dream ingredients.
{{204987124-0-79822:}}What else should I know about Elenglynn?
{{204987124-0-82123:}}That's incredible.
{{204987124-0-82129:}}Thanks, Ulfsild.
{{204987124-0-81451:}}Why is that?
{{204987124-0-81450:}}Tell me more about Lady Valente.
{{204987124-0-81457:}}What's that about a new forest?
{{204987124-0-81458:}}Could Valenwood have caused this?
{{204987124-1-80634:}}Tell me more about what you think King Nantharion is up to.
{{204987124-1-81256:}}At Rustwall, I learned that the Recollection is working with Daedra. A Shardmarshal Vargas.
{{204987124-0-80429:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-80428:}}So you stole to survive?
{{204987124-0-80422:}}What's the arcane knot?
{{204987124-0-80421:}}It sounds like you have something personal against him.
{{204987124-0-80420:}}Who is Xoryn?
{{204987124-0-80427:}}And then you deserted.
{{204987124-0-80426:}}You want me to find Naku and convince him to come?
{{204987124-0-80424:}}Where is he?
{{204987124-0-81462:}}Why did Greenspeaker Sorilen ask you to meet her here?
{{204987124-0-78308:}}Sounds easy enough.
{{204987124-0-80259:}}Bella said that knife belonged to her family.
{{204987124-1-80213:}}What do you make of King Nantharion's plans?
{{204987124-1-80215:}}If it's so dangerous, why did your niece go out on her own?
{{204987124-1-80216:}}Vashabar is down the road.
{{204987124-0-81115:}}So you're with me?
{{204987124-0-81117:}}Do you know what ritual she was talking about?
{{204987124-0-81110:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-80923:}}Withs King Nantharion's death, what happens to Vashabar?
{{204987124-0-80920:}}Shouldn't we try to defend West Weald from these incursions?
{{204987124-0-79423:}}She should start in the front.
{{204987124-0-81948:}}Ursilia says if you deal with her husband, she'll forgive your affront against her and her family.
{{204987124-0-81943:}}Help me understand the Lamp of Clarity's purpose.
{{204987124-0-81942:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-81941:}}Can you explain more about the Sage's Dream?
{{204987124-0-81940:}}Why would it aid me now?
{{204987124-0-81947:}}I'm ready to explore the next path.
{{204987124-0-81946:}}Can I ask you about the Many Paths.
{{204987124-0-81945:}}Help me understand the Lamp of Clarity's purpose.
{{204987124-0-81944:}}How will this help the Ithelia from my reality?
{{204987124-2-80433:}}What have you been doing since the trouble at Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-1-81008:}}Can you explain more about the Sage's Dream?
{{204987124-0-81315:}}Could Vashabar's Wood Elves be involved with the Recollection?
{{204987124-2-81637:}}Why do you tend the Wilderhall?
{{204987124-2-81635:}}Sorilen's a Greenspeaker? Tell me about them.
{{204987124-0-81042:}}Thank you, Gryphon.
{{204987124-0-81666:}}You seem particularly interested in the Ayleids.
{{204987124-0-81667:}}The Archmagister is going to visit the Scholarium?
{{204987124-0-81664:}}I have some other questions.
{{204987124-0-81661:}}Heard from Eveli Sharp-Arrow lately?
{{204987124-0-80292:}}What's the Darkened Home? What power sleeps there?
{{204987124-1-79306:}}I fought off Shardmarshal Vargas at Feldagard Keep and acquired the blade Abolisher.
{{204987124-0-80071:}}All right. I'll accompany you and Leramil to examine this instability.
{{204987124-0-80072:}}Where should I start?
{{204987124-0-80075:}}I need to get this information to Fennorian.
{{204987124-0-82154:}}What do you plan to do?
{{204987124-0-81590:}}He can't marry Laeni and support the village at the same time?
{{204987124-0-81592:}}Vashabar?
{{204987124-0-80747:}}Why not?
{{204987124-0-80748:}}And you're going to help me with portals.
{{204987124-0-80749:}}What did it say?
{{204987124-1-78858:}}What will you do with the captured Recollection soldier?
{{204987124-0-80948:}}You want me to protect people?
{{204987124-0-80944:}}What can I do?
{{204987124-0-80947:}}I just want to restore the Scholarium and master Scribing.
{{204987124-0-80942:}}Why did she freeze him?
{{204987124-1-80980:}}Why were you experimenting with Daedric magic?
{{204987124-0-81091:}}The count and the greenspeaker want to talk to me?
{{204987124-0-81093:}}All right. I'll talk to Count Calantius and Greenspeaker Darolith.
{{204987124-0-81097:}}You've got a different answer now?
{{204987124-0-81096:}}Where are Beragon and Tribune Alea, then?
{{204987124-0-81099:}}Scruut can be a bit dramatic but basically, yes. Oh, I meant to ask you about Ninglenirre Pass.
{{204987124-0-81098:}}Will your people listen to you?
{{204987124-1-81766:}}Did you say you created a Tribute deck?
{{204987124-0-78943:}}All right, we'll go get the survivors. Where did you hide the catacomb key?
{{204987124-0-78941:}}What happened to the legionaries who disappeared?
{{204987124-0-78940:}}Let's go find Groundskeeper Gaius.
{{204987124-1-81777:}}What else can you tell me about Votary Nahlia?
{{204987124-1-81889:}}What are you, exactly? What are the Luminaries?
{{204987124-1-81637:}}Can I ask you some questions about the Rite of Propagation?
{{204987124-1-80726:}}This village is called Vashabar, you said. Can you tell me about it?
{{204987124-0-81502:}}What's next, Beragon?
{{204987124-0-81500:}}All right, Nahlia. Let's go.
{{204987124-0-81507:}}The Order of the Lamp. Can you tell me more about them?
{{204987124-0-81506:}}What else can you tell me about this place?
{{204987124-0-78911:}}Change?
{{204987124-1-80412:}}It sounds like you have something personal against him.
{{204987124-1-81372:}}Why hide with these beasts in Fyrelight Cave?
{{204987124-1-81932:}}Remind me of what your reflection said about the Lamp of Clarity.
{{204987124-1-81455:}}Tell me more about the invitation you found.
{{204987124-0-80351:}}Tell me more about the three Scarlets I'm looking for.
{{204987124-0-80353:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-78639:}}I've already been to a place you mentioned.
{{204987124-0-78638:}}I stopped the Recollection and Shardmarshal Vargas from using Rustwall Estate to invade Skingrad.
{{204987124-0-78636:}}The One Who Knows?
{{204987124-0-78631:}}Could Otho have staged the scene?
{{204987124-0-79948:}}What is the Recollection doing?
{{204987124-0-79949:}}This house is enormous. It's all yours?
{{204987124-0-79947:}}Has the Recollection been around long?
{{204987124-1-81514:}}Why do you want Nahlia to assist me on my trial?
{{204987124-2-81594:}}What should I know about Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-2-81129:}}I vow to protect others to the end of my days.
{{204987124-2-81125:}}I vow to be curious about what lies ahead.
{{204987124-0-79197:}}What will you do with the captured Recollection soldier?
{{204987124-0-79196:}}What's the purpose of the signal fires again?
{{204987124-2-80294:}}Can you tell me more about this lens?
{{204987124-2-81973:}}How is that fox the Gryphon's soft spot?
{{204987124-0-80349:}}So you deserted?
{{204987124-0-81122:}}Like the version I saw of Ithelia when I traveled the Many Paths at the Outcast Inn.
{{204987124-0-81532:}}What should I know about Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-79359:}}I'll reset the traps and burn the ropes.
{{204987124-0-79352:}}The commander?
{{204987124-0-79355:}}Let's investigate the barracks.
{{204987124-0-79357:}}How will resetting traps and burning ropes help exactly?
{{204987124-0-81534:}}Why were you jealous?
{{204987124-0-81277:}}You're outnumbered. This is an act of desperation—admit it.
{{204987124-0-80677:}}Could what be that simple?
{{204987124-1-81895:}}Who is Quatrius Idolus?
{{204987124-1-81890:}}Why are you having me do these particular challenges?
{{204987124-0-81781:}}So what now, Leramil?
{{204987124-0-81783:}}So what really happened here, legionary?
{{204987124-0-81785:}}What is it, Beragon?
{{204987124-0-81253:}}What happens then?
{{204987124-0-81256:}}But what are they hoping to accomplish?
{{204987124-0-81255:}}What does the Recollection want?
{{204987124-0-81606:}}Is everyone in Vashabar a greenspeaker?
{{204987124-1-78255:}}Earlier, you mentioned Lazen. Who is that?
{{204987124-0-81608:}}Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town.
{{204987124-0-80915:}}I'm sorry, Leramil. There was nothing I could do.
{{204987124-0-80825:}}You're committed to the Dawnway, then?
{{204987124-0-80822:}}She said it was time to go home. And something about a loom and restoring what was lost.
{{204987124-0-82089:}}Since I'm new here, what should I know about the town of Ontus?
{{204987124-1-79813:}}What's a greenspeaker?
{{204987124-1-79812:}}Can you tell me about Vashabar?
{{204987124-1-79810:}}Why can't you just get married? Ignore what your fathers think.
{{204987124-1-79816:}}Have you heard about King Nantharion's true plan?
{{204987124-0-82081:}}What do you want me to do next?
{{204987124-0-80665:}}What was Mizbi's riddle?
{{204987124-2-82016:}}We're stealing creatia from Nocturnal? Where?
{{204987124-2-82014:}}What do I have to do in Mehrunes Dagon's realm?
{{204987124-0-81437:}}Were you two close?
{{204987124-0-81013:}}What happens now for you and your followers?
{{204987124-0-81199:}}The camp is cursed?
{{204987124-1-80015:}}Can you tell me more about these Luminaries of magic?
{{204987124-1-78370:}}I'm a vampire. Are we going to have a problem, Ravenwatch?
{{204987124-1-78376:}}Who's Lady Valente?
{{204987124-0-81860:}}Can you tell me more about yourself?
{{204987124-0-81861:}}Can you tell me more about yourself?
{{204987124-0-81862:}}Your cellar connects to old ruins?
{{204987124-0-81864:}}I'll see what Ulfsild has to say, then.
{{204987124-0-81867:}}What about the ritual?
{{204987124-0-78781:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-78780:}}All right. We'll check in at Hoperoot if we learn anything more.
{{204987124-0-78783:}}What could King Nantharion and Ithelia do with that much magicka?
{{204987124-0-78784:}}Very well. I'll meet you there.
{{204987124-0-78786:}}More than Shardborn and Recollection?
{{204987124-0-78259:}}You mentioned Blue Aedral a few times. What exactly is it?
{{204987124-0-78256:}}Wait. Lazen's a dog?
{{204987124-0-80736:}}What kind of help do you have in mind?
{{204987124-0-80733:}}All right. Where do we start?
{{204987124-1-81914:}}Tell me more about the invitation you found.
{{204987124-0-80730:}}Ulfsild's notes said it was a cave.
{{204987124-1-81919:}}What have you been up to since the last time we met, Fennorian?
{{204987124-3-79658:}}I have some thoughts on the paradox.
{{204987124-0-81276:}}You're outnumbered. This is an act of desperation—admit it.
{{204987124-0-81273:}}All right. I'll talk to Caelum and keep him distracted.
{{204987124-0-81279:}}That's where you're wrong.
{{204987124-2-78376:}}The vineyard is growing a new kind of grape?
{{204987124-1-81922:}}What does a Chronicler do, exactly?
{{204987124-1-79226:}}Sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
{{204987124-1-81800:}}You like the Crow?
{{204987124-1-81828:}}Do you think the ground shaking and the wildburn seed are connected?
{{204987124-1-80113:}}I'm a necromancer, you know.
{{204987124-1-82114:}}I have a few basic questions for you.
{{204987124-1-82112:}}I have a few basic questions for you.
{{204987124-1-82113:}}I have a few basic questions for you.
{{204987124-3-81342:}}What are Lady Sowerra's options?
{{204987124-0-79053:}}What were those Daedra doing in the ruins?
{{204987124-0-79051:}}Sounds like you admire the Recollection.
{{204987124-0-79057:}}Fine. Let me look at this epitaph.
{{204987124-0-79054:}}So you can solve this then?
{{204987124-0-79055:}}So you can solve this then?
{{204987124-0-79058:}}Indeed. You never know.
{{204987124-0-81308:}}I'll do that.
{{204987124-1-81594:}}How did you become Count Calantius's marshal?
{{204987124-1-81596:}}What have you been doing since the events at Feldagard Keep?
{{204987124-1-81593:}}You mentioned Quatrius Idolus. Who's that?
{{204987124-0-80158:}}What do the Goblin totems look like?
{{204987124-0-81064:}}All right. I'll look for your vanity in Dawnwood.
{{204987124-2-79604:}}I'm a necromancer. Do you want some tips?
{{204987124-0-81349:}}Follow the road to Skingrad
{{204987124-0-81342:}}Your debut?
{{204987124-0-81347:}}Stay here. I'll see if anyone is waiting in the woods.
{{204987124-3-78732:}}What's our next step?
{{204987124-0-80541:}}What's the plan?
{{204987124-0-80544:}}What should I know about Lord Gallio Valente?
{{204987124-0-80546:}}You mentioned a new kind of grape?
{{204987124-0-80549:}}I'll see what we can do.
{{204987124-0-81709:}}Do you know where Ithelia was exiled?
{{204987124-0-81708:}}What kind of place is Ostumir?
{{204987124-0-81700:}}Why would this be controversial?
{{204987124-0-81703:}}Tell me about greenspeakers.
{{204987124-0-81702:}}Why would this be controversial?
{{204987124-0-81705:}}Why did you come to Ostumir?
{{204987124-0-81704:}}Beragon explained that this forest growth happened recently. Is it the result of greenspeaking?
{{204987124-0-81707:}}Why do you think she's behaving that way?
{{204987124-0-81474:}}What's next for you, Lady Ursilia?
{{204987124-0-79157:}}How do you mean different?
{{204987124-0-79156:}}What did you remember?
{{204987124-0-79155:}}What do you mean, the roots of the Dawnway?
{{204987124-0-79159:}}I'll search the inn's courtyard for the book on obscure drinks.
{{204987124-0-82050:}}You think the Gryphon is pathetic?
{{204987124-0-82051:}}You don't think the Netch accomplishes anything?
{{204987124-0-82052:}}The Indrik seemed focused on the responsibility of your power.
{{204987124-0-82053:}}I have a few other questions.
{{204987124-0-82054:}}I have a few other questions.
{{204987124-0-82055:}}I have a few other questions.
{{204987124-1-81388:}}You didn't know the null arca would work?
{{204987124-1-81387:}}What happened back there when the knot fractured?
{{204987124-1-81382:}}You didn't know the null arca would work?
{{204987124-2-81904:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-1-80384:}}Tell me more about destroying the record of your debt instead of paying.
{{204987124-0-80857:}}I'll look for the rite in the Wilderhall. Thank you, Spinner Belwelas.
{{204987124-0-82029:}}Can we talk about the Luminaries?
{{204987124-0-78593:}}I'm not sure what you're talking about.
{{204987124-0-78594:}}As you wish.
{{204987124-0-79743:}}Tell me about the quarry.
{{204987124-0-79540:}}Good to hear.
{{204987124-0-78708:}}Is such a path possible? What would we need to do to make that happen?
{{204987124-0-78705:}}Isn't that why you chose a mortal to help you? Because we see things differently from you?
{{204987124-0-78707:}}Do the Many Paths only lead to alternate realities?
{{204987124-0-78706:}}Ithelia can find a distant reality without magicka. Where she would have no power and pose no harm.
{{204987124-0-81410:}}You don't think the wine is worth retrieving?
{{204987124-0-81413:}}Are you sure you don't know who ambushed you?
{{204987124-0-78802:}}All right, let's go to the bank.
{{204987124-0-81419:}}Scruut …?
{{204987124-1-81990:}}How were you able to get into the Gryphon's domain if the door was closed?
{{204987124-1-81993:}}Are you a Luminary, like the Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-81510:}}What is it?
{{204987124-0-81511:}}Can you make us a portal to Sunnamere?
{{204987124-0-81516:}}The winds of the soul?
{{204987124-1-81462:}}I'd like to hear more about you.
{{204987124-0-78801:}}You said the letter mentioned survivors ….
{{204987124-3-82030:}}I have a few other questions.
{{204987124-1-79685:}}What's the premise?
{{204987124-3-82036:}}Can you tell me more about this trial?
{{204987124-0-79443:}}Ciiril was hoping you might ask the couple to stay.
{{204987124-2-81734:}}Can you give me some more guidance with this riddle?
{{204987124-2-81732:}}Can you give me some more guidance with this riddle?
{{204987124-6-78324:}}What can you tell me about Haldain Lumber Camp?
{{204987124-6-78321:}}What do you know about Nonungalo?
{{204987124-0-80473:}}Can you tell me more about the seedpods?
{{204987124-0-80479:}}All right. Let's head into the auction.
{{204987124-2-79683:}}What are Agmund's thoughts on it?
{{204987124-2-79686:}}What are your thoughts on it?
{{204987124-2-81741:}}How is coming up with a riddle a trial?
{{204987124-2-81740:}}How can I understand your mind? You're a Luminary of Magic.
{{204987124-1-79887:}}What more can you tell me about Ulfsild?
{{204987124-1-79658:}}Is there some way I can help?
{{204987124-0-81966:}}An intelligent fox stole the fable pages?
{{204987124-0-81662:}}I have some other questions.
{{204987124-2-80216:}}The town of Ontus is up that road.
{{204987124-0-78354:}}Yes, I completed the legionary's mission. The signal fires are blazing.
{{204987124-0-78352:}}Devastation? New forest?
{{204987124-0-78353:}}Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?
{{204987124-0-78350:}}And while you're doing that, what should I do?
{{204987124-0-78359:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-1-82011:}}What's Apocrypha like?
{{204987124-1-82010:}}We're stealing creatia from Nocturnal? Where?
{{204987124-1-82013:}}What are the Deadlands like?
{{204987124-1-82012:}}We're stealing creatia from Nocturnal? Where?
{{204987124-1-82015:}}What is Evergloam like?
{{204987124-1-82014:}}Hermaeus Mora? Where are we stealing his creatia?
{{204987124-1-82017:}}What else should I know about Elenglynn?
{{204987124-1-82016:}}Where are we stealing creatia from Mehrunes Dagon?
{{204987124-1-82019:}}I'm not sure I understand how Ithelia escaped.
{{204987124-1-81129:}}I vow to be compassionate to others to the end of my days.
{{204987124-1-80573:}}You're committed to the Dawnway, then?
{{204987124-3-82007:}}What do I have to do in Mehrunes Dagon's realm?
{{204987124-1-81658:}}Why did Greenspeaker Sorilen ask you to meet her here?
{{204987124-0-80874:}}Why don't you return to Skingrad and heal up? I'll find the cub.
{{204987124-0-80875:}}Tell me about this bear.
{{204987124-0-80876:}}Sounds adorable.
{{204987124-0-80877:}}How did you get your injuries?
{{204987124-1-81656:}}I'd like to hear more about you.
{{204987124-1-81655:}}We should go look for Greenspeaker Sorilen.
{{204987124-0-81627:}}Did Ithelia pass through Fargrave on her way to somewhere else?
{{204987124-0-81624:}}You said your families hate each other?
{{204987124-0-79471:}}Why do you think these deserters took control of Fort Colovia?
{{204987124-0-79479:}}Well, enjoy the rest of your jagga. Thank you for talking to me.
{{204987124-0-80976:}}Where do I get the ingredients?
{{204987124-1-80881:}}Tell me about Xoryn.
{{204987124-2-78988:}}What can you tell me about Elenglynn?
{{204987124-3-81968:}}What do you mean by strong personality? Stronger than the Netch?
{{204987124-0-81914:}}What do you know about the vineyard and winery?
{{204987124-0-81915:}}What do you know about the vineyard and winery?
{{204987124-0-81916:}}Why did the invitation make you suspicious?
{{204987124-0-81910:}}If she could see magic why did she need the lens?
{{204987124-0-78771:}}I destroyed the seeds. But the Recollection wiped out the farm and a Wood Elf camp at the Hollow.
{{204987124-2-82108:}}How did the Luminaries help her with Scribing?
{{204987124-0-78776:}}Greenspeaker Sorilen is from Vashabar, right? She's a member of the Recollection.
{{204987124-1-81719:}}Who is Saint Alessia?
{{204987124-0-79692:}}Thanks.
{{204987124-1-79686:}}What's the premise?
{{204987124-1-79684:}}What are your thoughts on it?
{{204987124-1-79683:}}What are your thoughts on it?
{{204987124-1-79688:}}It sounds like Molag Bal is actually kind of pathetic, a prisoner of his own nature.
{{204987124-0-80227:}}Why do you say the Goblins are angry?
{{204987124-0-80226:}}Have you asked the Crow?
{{204987124-0-81843:}}I'll find that crystal, then.
{{204987124-0-81849:}}What more can you tell me about Ulfsild?
{{204987124-0-79871:}}Are you sensing the Echonir?
{{204987124-0-79873:}}Very well.
{{204987124-2-61630:}}Have you kept busy since we last met?
{{204987124-0-81668:}}Your commander was happy?
{{204987124-0-81669:}}The Archmagister is going to visit the Scholarium?
{{204987124-1-81755:}}Anything else you can tell me about the wildburn?
{{204987124-1-81754:}}I fought the Recollection at Rustwall with Tribune Alea Idolus.
{{204987124-0-82152:}}Thanks for helping me through all this, Leramil. And enjoy your vacation!
{{204987124-0-81594:}}How did you get the rank of tribune?
{{204987124-0-81599:}}How could Spinner Belwelas help?
{{204987124-2-80848:}}What are you doing here, Keshargo?
{{204987124-1-80889:}}Have you heard about King Nantharion's true plan?
{{204987124-0-78914:}}If I wanted to make something explode, what would you suggest?
{{204987124-0-78913:}}That's when you decided to leave and find a cure?
{{204987124-3-80346:}}You were a thief?
{{204987124-0-78919:}}Won't they notice that I'm not a vampire?
{{204987124-0-78276:}}The brigand who robbed you was Amuarel Verdulis.
{{204987124-0-78271:}}And you said she controlled the beasts?
{{204987124-0-78272:}}What if you don't like each other?
{{204987124-0-78278:}}She needed the dowry to run away.
{{204987124-0-80548:}}Understood. I'll ask around and see what I can learn.
{{204987124-0-80711:}}What's going on?
{{204987124-1-81972:}}What do you mean by strong personality?
{{204987124-1-81971:}}You said he lost it to Sheogorath in a wager?
{{204987124-1-81976:}}Have you learned anything else about Ulfsild or the Gryphon in your research?
{{204987124-1-81974:}}Why do you think Ulfsild wrote down so little about herself?
{{204987124-2-81853:}}Can you tell me more about yourself?
{{204987124-1-80792:}}Tell me about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-2-81850:}}You called this place the Scholarium? Where are we?
{{204987124-2-81858:}}We'll speak again when you return.
{{204987124-2-79810:}}What's a greenspeaker?
{{204987124-0-79658:}}What's the Molag Bal Paradox?
{{204987124-2-81801:}}You mentioned the Crow. You like her?
{{204987124-2-81802:}}How do you feel now?
{{204987124-1-79528:}}I know of some safe places that aren't vineyards.
{{204987124-0-79226:}}I am, but I travel a lot.
{{204987124-0-80382:}}If I deal with your tab, would you go to the Outlaws Refuge in Skingrad?
{{204987124-0-80380:}}It didn't work out that way?
{{204987124-0-80386:}}Hooke's waiting for you in the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge.
{{204987124-0-80384:}}This should cover it.
{{204987124-0-80388:}}Hooke's waiting for you in the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge.
{{204987124-0-78666:}}Do you think the note is a forgery?
{{204987124-0-78667:}}What do we know so far?
{{204987124-0-78665:}}What about the confession?
{{204987124-0-78662:}}How long before the Legion reinforcements arrive?
{{204987124-0-78663:}}So if a non-vampire drinks the wine, then a vampire drains them and gains power?
{{204987124-0-78660:}}How long before the Legion reinforcements arrive?
{{204987124-0-78661:}}How long before the Legion reinforcements arrive?
{{204987124-0-78668:}}We found him dead by the estate fountain.
{{204987124-0-78595:}}Why not?
{{204987124-2-81889:}}Where are we?
{{204987124-0-81416:}}I should speak with Orissa.
{{204987124-1-81896:}}Tell me about Feldagard Keep.
{{204987124-1-81893:}}Why are you having me do these particular challenges?
{{204987124-2-79458:}}Have you heard about King Nantharion's true plan?
{{204987124-3-78321:}}Why does a Reach diplomat care about some old, discarded trinkets?
{{204987124-3-78324:}}What do you know about Nonungalo?
{{204987124-2-81462:}}What have you been up to since we last met?
{{204987124-2-81465:}}Can you tell me about yourself?
{{204987124-1-80402:}}Go on. When was the last time you spoke with Hooke?
{{204987124-1-81368:}}What did she say about Sage's Dream?
{{204987124-1-80406:}}Tell me more about Regomor.
{{204987124-0-79306:}}What's next, Beragon?
{{204987124-0-79799:}}Why wouldn't you be available?
{{204987124-1-79196:}}Tell me about the legionary whose orders I recovered.
{{204987124-1-79197:}}Tell me about the legionary whose orders I recovered.
{{204987124-1-79198:}}What overgrowth are you talking about?
{{204987124-1-80805:}}Tell me more about the threat you perceive here.
{{204987124-1-80800:}}What's the Dawnway?
{{204987124-1-80801:}}Tell me about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-1-80802:}}What's the Dawnway?
{{204987124-0-81994:}}What should I know about Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-81995:}}New forest?
{{204987124-0-81996:}}How did you get the rank of tribune?
{{204987124-0-81997:}}How were you able to get into the Gryphon's domain if the door was closed?
{{204987124-0-81990:}}How did you and the Gryphon become friends?
{{204987124-0-81991:}}Are you from Hircine's realm? The Hunting Grounds?
{{204987124-0-81992:}}So the Gryphon saved you from these Elven soldiers.
{{204987124-0-81993:}}How did you and the Gryphon become friends?
{{204987124-0-78413:}}What about the sentry spheres?
{{204987124-2-82049:}}What do you make of the Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-78419:}}Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?
{{204987124-0-78418:}}If I destroy the aggression of root, why do I need to post the warning bulletins?
{{204987124-1-81860:}}Who are the associates you want to bring back?
{{204987124-0-80649:}}I'll place the fable on the dais.
{{204987124-0-80648:}}I want to take your trial, Dragon.
{{204987124-0-80646:}}Ulfsild's notes came up with an answer.
{{204987124-0-80645:}}Do you know of any caves near Willowgrove?
{{204987124-0-81205:}}What happens when we find him?
{{204987124-0-81200:}}I'm <<1>>. I found the orders beside a dead legionary. I decided to finish their mission.
{{204987124-0-81201:}}But you're having trouble?
{{204987124-0-81208:}}That sounds difficult.
{{204987124-0-81209:}}Good luck.
{{204987124-0-81895:}}How did you become marshal to Count Calantius?
{{204987124-3-82016:}}What do I need to do in Nocturnal's realm?
{{204987124-0-80272:}}Couldn't it be one of the other items?
{{204987124-0-81724:}}What are you going to do about the remaining Daedra and Recollection cultists beneath Rustwall?
{{204987124-2-81349:}}Weatherleah is over there.
{{204987124-4-78329:}}What can you tell me about the Recollection leaders?
{{204987124-1-80376:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-0-78417:}}Are you going to question people, too?
{{204987124-0-78416:}}Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?
{{204987124-0-78411:}}Anything I should know about the Goblins?
{{204987124-0-78410:}}Why can't the Legion handle this themselves?
{{204987124-0-80939:}}I should be able to find the Gryphon's door then.
{{204987124-1-79018:}}The Recollection has a particular interest in Ayeleid treasures.
{{204987124-0-78998:}}Why do you think these deserters took control of Fort Colovia?
{{204987124-0-78999:}}Allies?
{{204987124-0-80067:}}What did you do?
{{204987124-0-80066:}}Understood.
{{204987124-0-78992:}}I'll head out to investigate those sites now.
{{204987124-0-79797:}}Can you tell where it leads?
{{204987124-0-79647:}}You seem disappointed we need to destroy this equipment.
{{204987124-0-81812:}}What do you want to do about the wildburn seed?
{{204987124-0-81819:}}Can you tell me more about the Order of the Lamp?
{{204987124-0-82036:}}Can we talk about the Luminaries?
{{204987124-0-82035:}}Why did you choose the form of a Netch?
{{204987124-2-81589:}}Why were you so quick to help the couple?
{{204987124-1-80767:}}Why were you so quick to help the couple?
{{204987124-0-79310:}}All right, let's go to the bank.
{{204987124-0-80676:}}A lesson.
{{204987124-0-79313:}}Why do you want me to check your father's office?
{{204987124-0-80826:}}You mentioned you're a blade dancer?
{{204987124-2-81667:}}Are you looking forward to the role?
{{204987124-3-81972:}}What do you mean by strong personality? Stronger than the Netch?
{{204987124-0-81207:}}Good luck.
{{204987124-0-79939:}}Where do I start?
{{204987124-0-79938:}}And you want me to be this inheritor?
{{204987124-0-79934:}}How do you know about the spare vault key?
{{204987124-0-79937:}}Why would you get involved with cultists?
{{204987124-0-79931:}}So you're going to stick around?
{{204987124-0-79932:}}Can't we just pick the lock to the vault?
{{204987124-0-81300:}}Good thing he has you.
{{204987124-0-81499:}}You really do like riddles.
{{204987124-0-81490:}}You feel compelled to act this way?
{{204987124-0-81493:}}Why are you and the Fox companions?
{{204987124-0-79069:}}You're lucky to have her.
{{204987124-0-79068:}}So why is Greenspeaker Sorilen working with the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-79067:}}You said no Bosmer who honors the Green would deal with a wildburn seed. What about Sorilen?
{{204987124-0-79066:}}So what's a Wood Elf doing living in Skingrad?
{{204987124-0-79064:}}The wildburn seed?
{{204987124-1-78654:}}Legionary Calvo wanted to prove that a son of Ontus was as loyal and courageous as anyone else.
{{204987124-0-78810:}}All right. Let's scout the perimeter.
{{204987124-0-78819:}}Very well. I'll see you in Skingrad.
{{204987124-0-81660:}}All right. If you can shed the power, do it now.
{{204987124-1-81918:}}What have you been up to since the last time we met, Fennorian?
{{204987124-0-79798:}}Why is this place so important to the Mages Guild?
{{204987124-0-80348:}}What happened?
{{204987124-0-79308:}}I need to tell you, Ghraguk didn't make it. He died from his wounds.
{{204987124-0-79304:}}Apparently I must.
{{204987124-0-79691:}}Perhaps.
{{204987124-0-81310:}}Will you remain in Sutch or move on?
{{204987124-0-81314:}}In Ostumir, where we found that seed, the Recollection indicated they created the new forest.
{{204987124-0-80531:}}So whatever we do at these spots will likewise resonate and repair the entire fabric?
{{204987124-0-80532:}}Are you confident that the threat of Ithelia is really over this time?
{{204987124-0-80535:}}What will happen to Ithelia's minions now?
{{204987124-0-80534:}}You're all-knowing. Why did this outcome surprise you?
{{204987124-0-80537:}}Are you confident that the threat of Ithelia is really over this time?
{{204987124-0-80536:}}Are you confident that the threat of Ithelia is really over this time?
{{204987124-0-78623:}}What did you do?
{{204987124-0-81054:}}I'll look for your fear southwest of Ontus.
{{204987124-0-78621:}}What sort of mischief?
{{204987124-0-78625:}}She was dead?
{{204987124-0-81057:}}And then the ground shook?
{{204987124-1-80535:}}What about my allies. They helped stop Ithelia. Can't they remember what happened, too?
{{204987124-1-80536:}}What about my allies. They helped stop Ithelia. Can't they remember what happened, too?
{{204987124-0-81056:}}If you think Bella is missing, why not form a search party?
{{204987124-0-80881:}}What is the Arcane Knot?
{{204987124-0-80880:}}What is the Arcane Knot?
{{204987124-0-80889:}}Is today the first time you spoke of leaving?
{{204987124-0-80888:}}You're proud of the village but you still want to leave?
{{204987124-0-82025:}}You sensed something like this before? Where?
{{204987124-0-82026:}}The Recollection said they created the forest. She said we might find more seeds east of Leftwheal.
{{204987124-0-79786:}}What about the wildburn?
{{204987124-0-79785:}}All right, I'll place the relics and cast the spell. Where do I need to go?
{{204987124-0-78761:}}You mean everyone will forget everything that happened in Necrom and West Weald?
{{204987124-2-80915:}}<Remain silent.>
{{204987124-0-81912:}}What do you know about the vineyard and winery?
{{204987124-0-78840:}}King Nantharion said he was going to Hoperoot to oversee the establishment of the new settlement.
{{204987124-1-79097:}}How have you been, Mizzik?
{{204987124-0-81467:}}What happens to the Valente Vineyard now?
{{204987124-1-78324:}}You really don't know where these crystaljack wasps came from?
{{204987124-1-78325:}}Who are you exactly?
{{204987124-1-78329:}}What can you tell me about Stri the Fate-Eater?
{{204987124-0-79539:}}I will. See you soon.
{{204987124-0-79537:}}Where are Laeni and Clendagal?
{{204987124-0-79536:}}You find the path, Ithelia shows you how to open the way, then I destroy the path with Abolisher.
{{204987124-0-81469:}}What do you remember about her?
{{204987124-0-81899:}}Why did you lend your power to the fawn?
{{204987124-0-81898:}}You regret it that much?
{{204987124-0-81891:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-0-81890:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-0-81893:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-0-81892:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-0-81894:}}What was the Battle for North Hook?
{{204987124-0-81897:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-0-81896:}}What do you know about the attacking forces?
{{204987124-1-81941:}}Why would an Itheila lose control of her powers?
{{204987124-0-80768:}}Why does Laeni call you Agawen Ciiril?
{{204987124-0-80769:}}Do you want Laeni and Clendagal to marry?
{{204987124-0-80767:}}Do you want Laeni and Clendagal to marry?
{{204987124-0-79887:}}You called this place the Scholarium? Where are we?
{{204987124-0-79889:}}Have to try what?
{{204987124-0-79888:}}I want to help, just tell me what to do.
{{204987124-2-81507:}}All right, I'm ready to head through that portal.
{{204987124-2-80676:}}Kindness.
{{204987124-0-82175:}}Can we talk more about the Chronicler?
{{204987124-0-79823:}}Tell me more about the Echonir.
{{204987124-0-81465:}}You've mentioned Ulfsild several times. What did she mean to you?
{{204987124-0-81461:}}Thank you for talking about it.
{{204987124-0-81468:}}You're not worried about word getting out about what happened here?
{{204987124-0-81367:}}Right, let's head back.
{{204987124-0-78892:}}What if he tries to turn you back into a vampire?
{{204987124-0-78894:}}All right. Let's head to the mine.
{{204987124-0-80106:}}Land that doesn't belong to them?
{{204987124-0-79762:}}So, Beragon Sharp-Dagger?
{{204987124-0-79766:}}So, what's next for Curate Gadayn?
{{204987124-0-78560:}}What makes you say that?
{{204987124-0-78562:}}Do you know what happened to <<1>>?
{{204987124-0-78565:}}Uriel returned after his mother's death?
{{204987124-0-78564:}}Mizzik and I are here to help.
{{204987124-0-78567:}}Here's the will. Dog slobber and all.
{{204987124-0-78566:}}I'll meet you by the manor when I'm ready.
{{204987124-0-78569:}}Yes, I'm ready.
{{204987124-0-78568:}}So I use that pattern to unlock the shard? What happens if I make a mistake?
{{204987124-2-79658:}}What are your thoughts on the paradox?
{{204987124-2-81715:}}Can you tell me more about these Luminaries of magic?
{{204987124-2-81910:}}I'm not sure how the Luminaries connect to Scribing or the altar.
{{204987124-1-79440:}}I came to tell you that Clendagal plans to leave the village so he and Laeni can wed.
{{204987124-1-79443:}}Ciiril was hoping you might ask the couple to stay.
{{204987124-1-79444:}}Ciiril hoped you might convince the couple to stay.
{{204987124-1-79449:}}Can you tell me more about the seedpods?
{{204987124-2-80497:}}Sorilen's a Greenspeaker? Tell me about them.
{{204987124-0-78360:}}The Despot of Markarth?
{{204987124-0-81758:}}Anything else you can tell me about the Wildburn?
{{204987124-0-81759:}}You created a Tribute deck?
{{204987124-0-81750:}}Thanks for explaining it to me, Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-81754:}}What do you know about the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-81755:}}The note indicates they're trying to recover a wildburn seed.
{{204987124-0-80809:}}You're welcome.
{{204987124-0-80801:}}Which side do you agree with?
{{204987124-0-80800:}}Which side do you agree with?
{{204987124-0-80802:}}Tell me about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-0-80805:}}What can you tell me about this inn?
{{204987124-0-80804:}}You and Ithelia were going to change history!
{{204987124-0-80807:}}I can't let Ithelia destroy reality.
{{204987124-0-79098:}}Is that all?
{{204987124-1-81662:}}What have you done since Grahtwood?
{{204987124-1-81661:}}What have you done since Grahtwood?
{{204987124-1-81665:}}What kind of place is Ostumir?
{{204987124-1-81082:}}What did you mean when you said that Keshargo was supposedly in charge?
{{204987124-0-80932:}}You want me to ask Nahlia for her help?
{{204987124-0-81678:}}Who is Saint Alessia?
{{204987124-2-81691:}}All right, I'm ready to head through that portal.
{{204987124-2-80344:}}Let's talk about something else.
{{204987124-2-80346:}}Tell me about Big Urm.
{{204987124-2-80342:}}Who's Valenia?
{{204987124-2-80343:}}Who's Valenia?
{{204987124-2-81968:}}What do you mean by strong personality?
{{204987124-0-78729:}}What will you do?
{{204987124-0-80289:}}Another purpose?
{{204987124-0-80069:}}Saving the fawn was a mistake?
{{204987124-0-80068:}}So what do you suggest?
{{204987124-0-80287:}}I'll give it a try.
{{204987124-0-78994:}}What's going on at Ostumir?
{{204987124-0-78995:}}What's going on at Ostumir?
{{204987124-1-80863:}}Why did you wait until now to suggest this?
{{204987124-0-78997:}}All right, let's enter the Ayleid ruins.
{{204987124-0-80065:}}Why would you get involved with cultists?
{{204987124-0-80983:}}What caused your personality to split?
{{204987124-0-80987:}}I'll talk to the Fox, then.
{{204987124-0-81580:}}You're certain no one else from the cohort survived?
{{204987124-0-80755:}}Light enough to have that conversation.
{{204987124-0-80276:}}As you wish.
{{204987124-0-78759:}}But not all the Wood Elves who originally followed Nantharion are part of the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-78753:}}Can you tell which locations these marks indicate?
{{204987124-0-78750:}}Why does <<1>> have an interest in ancient stonework?
{{204987124-0-78751:}}What are you and <<1>> doing in West Weald?
{{204987124-0-78756:}}What are you going to do?
{{204987124-0-78754:}}He was. He sacrificed himself to save me from that reality tear.
{{204987124-0-78755:}}And what about the relics? Is it safe to just leave them lying around out there?
{{204987124-0-79808:}}Why can't you just get married? Ignore what your fathers think.
{{204987124-0-79800:}}How did you get the rank of Tribune?
{{204987124-0-79805:}}You said Valenwood crossed the river?
{{204987124-0-81658:}}Tell me about Ostumir.
{{204987124-0-81657:}}We should go look for Greenspeaker Sorilen.
{{204987124-0-81655:}}Any idea why Greenspeaker Sorilen came to Ostumir?
{{204987124-2-79858:}}I'll head out to investigate those sites now.
{{204987124-1-80982:}}How am I supposed to get your facets to return to you?
{{204987124-0-82108:}}I have many other questions for you.
{{204987124-0-82109:}}Every Luminary has their own domain, their own wing like this?
{{204987124-0-82106:}}They're flexible. That's where the scripts come in?
{{204987124-0-82107:}}I have many other questions for you.
{{204987124-0-82104:}}The Luminaries lent her strength?
{{204987124-0-82105:}}I have many other questions for you.
{{204987124-0-82102:}}Scribing was a way for her to help others see magic like she did?
{{204987124-0-82103:}}She combined art with magic?
{{204987124-0-82100:}}Why did Ulfsild develop Scribing?
{{204987124-1-81430:}}We don't know what's beyond the unmarked door?
{{204987124-1-81431:}}We don't know what's beyond the unmarked door?
{{204987124-2-80890:}}What are you doing here, Keshargo?
{{204987124-0-81577:}}What do you know about the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-81574:}}What do you think of that?
{{204987124-0-81575:}}Tell me more about Regomor.
{{204987124-0-81570:}}Too late? What happened?
{{204987124-1-78988:}}What's going on in Ostumir?
{{204987124-1-78985:}}I'm a necromancer, you know.
{{204987124-1-79431:}}You should dance.
{{204987124-0-80180:}}Tell me more about this forgotten Daedric Prince.
{{204987124-0-80189:}}How do we get through the Recollection defenses?
{{204987124-0-79279:}}Tell me what you're doing here.
{{204987124-0-78307:}}All right, let's find that forge.
{{204987124-0-78303:}}I have. Leramil asked me to give you her regards, Gadayn.
{{204987124-0-78654:}}Legionary Calvo was mostly useless in there, so he volunteered to remain behind and ring the bell.
{{204987124-0-80400:}}So you'll meet with Hooke?
{{204987124-0-80402:}}I'll see you in the Outlaws Refuge of Skingrad, then.
{{204987124-0-80409:}}Someone other than the four of you?
{{204987124-0-80408:}}I see.
{{204987124-0-81446:}}I'll go check out the portal room then.
{{204987124-0-81445:}}Your magic came in handy again.
{{204987124-0-81442:}}How do we reach the cellars?
{{204987124-0-80173:}}Why do I need to investigate the Outcast Inn?
{{204987124-1-81575:}}What were you talking about earlier? About the fire, and Caelum Vineyard?
{{204987124-2-82055:}}Can you tell me about the Netch?
{{204987124-2-82053:}}What do you make of the Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-80568:}}I'll help you look into the Recollection's plans. Where do we start?
{{204987124-0-80565:}}Did Tribune Alea tell you what she was doing at Feldagard Keep?
{{204987124-0-79346:}}You think we can use the relics against Ithelia and her servants?
{{204987124-1-82049:}}Can you tell me about the Netch?
{{204987124-0-81137:}}I'm ready. What do I do?
{{204987124-0-81133:}}I vow to protect those I care about.
{{204987124-0-81138:}}I'll get started, then.
{{204987124-0-81139:}}What is the challenge here?
{{204987124-1-81007:}}Why does Hermaeus Mora see you as a threat?
{{204987124-1-81006:}}What's strange about a mortal entering the Many Paths?
{{204987124-1-81004:}}Why did you call the Ithelia from my path a reflection?
{{204987124-1-81003:}}Why did you call the Ithelia from my path a reflection?
{{204987124-1-81001:}}Why are we sneaking into these realms?
{{204987124-1-80848:}}Who are you?
{{204987124-0-81960:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-81968:}}How is that fox the Gryphon's soft spot?
{{204987124-0-81562:}}Why are you so happy?
{{204987124-0-80615:}}Tell me what you do remember about yourself.
{{204987124-0-80616:}}Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?
{{204987124-0-80610:}}The devastated area has affected the wildlife. Altered creatures attacked the camp.
{{204987124-1-80017:}}Shalidor became so obsessed with reclaiming Eyevea that Ulfsild left him.
{{204987124-1-80013:}}The island was returned to Nirn. I helped the Archmage best Sheogorath.
{{204987124-0-81626:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-81886:}}How will that open your door?
{{204987124-1-80574:}}Why do you tend the Wilderhall?
{{204987124-1-80546:}}Tell me about Lady Valente.
{{204987124-0-81625:}}How do you feel about the Green Pact?
{{204987124-1-78584:}}Grander deserves to know the truth.
{{204987124-0-82071:}}Good idea. I'll be back after I consult her notes.
{{204987124-0-81889:}}Why are you having me do these particular challenges?
{{204987124-0-80688:}}You were fine with marrying someone you didn't love or who didn't love you?
{{204987124-0-80684:}}I already found and delivered the creatures.
{{204987124-2-82009:}}What do I have to do in Mehrunes Dagon's realm?
{{204987124-0-81184:}}Speaking of adventures, I meant to ask about what happened at Ninglenirre Pass.
{{204987124-0-80966:}}That was someone else. The Belienne I spoke with wants to help you.
{{204987124-0-80968:}}What should we do?
{{204987124-0-80969:}}So the threat here is over?
{{204987124-0-81188:}}Right. Let's get into it.
{{204987124-1-82511:}}Tell me about fatigue fever.
{{204987124-0-78967:}}At Ostumir, I learned that the Recollection used a wildburn seed to create the new forest.
{{204987124-0-79617:}}Why would they have an issue with the Green Pact?
{{204987124-0-79610:}}Here. I found this in your father's desk.
{{204987124-0-79612:}}What are you thinking?
{{204987124-0-79619:}}What is the Dawnway exactly?
{{204987124-0-81797:}}What can I expect in the sunken ruins?
{{204987124-2-78315:}}Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers.
{{204987124-2-78316:}}I'm interested in work. Where do I start?
{{204987124-2-78317:}}I'm interested in work. Where do I start?
{{204987124-2-78319:}}I'm interested in work. Where do I start?
{{204987124-0-81407:}}And the door to the Indrik's domain?
{{204987124-1-81611:}}Why are you upset?
{{204987124-0-80489:}}What led up to everyone fleeing to the catacombs to hide?
{{204987124-0-80485:}}A memorial to Uriel?
{{204987124-0-80484:}}Why would Pelena run you out?
{{204987124-0-80486:}}What happened?
{{204987124-0-80483:}}You mentioned something about Wood Elves?
{{204987124-0-80482:}}Then what happened?
{{204987124-1-81819:}}What do you know about the anomaly?
{{204987124-0-79966:}}That's good to know.
{{204987124-0-79969:}}I'll see you in Auridon, then.
{{204987124-0-81533:}}What should I know about Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-81408:}}Why are the Luminary keys hidden like this?
{{204987124-0-79035:}}So that's why you've come to Wendir?
{{204987124-0-79036:}}So that's why you've come to Wendir?
{{204987124-0-79037:}}Where's Tribune Alea?
{{204987124-0-79039:}}Could we escape from this prison through the Many Paths?
{{204987124-0-80971:}}The others helped restore you. Without her, you won't be whole.
{{204987124-0-80970:}}Why did the Elves imprison you?
{{204987124-0-81531:}}What do you mean about methods?
{{204987124-0-80940:}}I'll see you in the Wing of the Gryphon, then.
{{204987124-0-80835:}}Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town.
{{204987124-0-79305:}}What changed your mind?
{{204987124-2-81109:}}What have you been doing since the trouble at Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-2-81101:}}Have you ever read this fable before?
{{204987124-2-81107:}}Thanks for telling me about yourself.
{{204987124-2-81106:}}Thanks for telling me about yourself.
{{204987124-2-80767:}}What's in this jagga you gave me?
{{204987124-2-80768:}}What's in this jagga you gave me?
{{204987124-2-80769:}}What's in this jagga you gave me?
{{204987124-0-81372:}}I better get back to Grander. Goodbye, Amaurel.
{{204987124-0-81373:}}Meet Tribune Alea, get inside, go up. Got it.
{{204987124-2-81986:}}How were you able to get into the Gryphon's domain if the door was closed?
{{204987124-0-79339:}}Then how do we restore the welkynd stone?
{{204987124-0-81610:}}Why are you here, Bella?
{{204987124-0-79488:}}I could help you try to retake it.
{{204987124-0-79485:}}What do you think Ithelia and Shardmarshal Vargas are going to do?
{{204987124-0-79481:}}What do the historical accounts say?
{{204987124-0-79483:}}Nantharion really thought he could resurrect the Ayleid Empire?
{{204987124-0-79482:}}How did Miscarcand fall, then?
{{204987124-0-79782:}}What happens next?
{{204987124-0-79783:}}That's it? Just place the three relics in specific locations?
{{204987124-0-81616:}}What are you doing here?
{{204987124-2-81512:}}What do you think about the Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-80695:}}Thank you, Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-80690:}}Is that all marriage is to you, a business opportunity?
{{204987124-2-82019:}}How do we stop Ithelia if we find her?
{{204987124-0-81805:}}Why did your facets run away in the first place?
{{204987124-2-78639:}}Tell me about these sites you want me to investigate.
{{204987124-2-78638:}}I'm not sure I understand how Ithelia escaped.
{{204987124-0-78670:}}And you know where we need to go to find the items the captain mentioned?
{{204987124-0-78673:}}Why does the confession say you were present for Lady Weatherleah's death?
{{204987124-1-81829:}}What can you tell me about this inn?
{{204987124-0-80396:}}Tell me about this note.
{{204987124-0-80131:}}What can you tell me about the town of Sutch?
{{204987124-0-78883:}}All right. I'll keep my eyes open.
{{204987124-0-78880:}}What can you tell me about the last time you were here?
{{204987124-0-78881:}}Ithelia mentioned the Many Paths. And a tavern where they converge.
{{204987124-2-79685:}}What are Agmund's thoughts on it?
{{204987124-0-78734:}}Do you know Tribune Alea?
{{204987124-4-82016:}}What do I have to do in Mehrunes Dagon's realm?
{{204987124-0-79286:}}And the Lamp of Clarity?
{{204987124-0-81043:}}Thank you, Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-81040:}}You'll support my journey to explore Scribing, then?
{{204987124-0-80820:}}Interesting.
{{204987124-0-81071:}}This man says you turned his wife into a pig.
{{204987124-1-81125:}}I vow to be compassionate about what lies ahead.
{{204987124-1-79017:}}We've met.
{{204987124-1-78319:}}Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers.
{{204987124-1-78313:}}What kind of tasks are we talking about?
{{204987124-1-78317:}}Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers.
{{204987124-1-78316:}}Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers.
{{204987124-1-78315:}}Tell me more about the jobs <<1>> offers.
{{204987124-0-79699:}}Who are you exactly?
{{204987124-0-79690:}}Good to hear.
{{204987124-0-81842:}}Tell me what you do remember about yourself.
{{204987124-0-81841:}}These echoes. Can you tell me about them?
{{204987124-0-81847:}}I'll talk to Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-81845:}}I'll find a new focus in the east wing.
{{204987124-0-81848:}}Are we in the Shivering Isles right now?
{{204987124-3-80345:}}You were a thief?
{{204987124-0-78270:}}You've never met your bride?
{{204987124-0-80710:}}What's going on?
{{204987124-0-80713:}}Well good luck, Grander, with whatever you decide to do.
{{204987124-0-80715:}}So you think we should flatter the Netch? How can we do that?
{{204987124-0-80716:}}Go right ahead.
{{204987124-1-81973:}}What do you mean by strong personality?
{{204987124-0-78632:}}What was that about the threads of fate?
{{204987124-0-78777:}}We also took a corrupted wildburn seed from the Recollection. We gave it to Greenspeaker Darolith.
{{204987124-3-80835:}}What does it mean to be a spinner?
{{204987124-3-80834:}}What does it mean to be a spinner?
{{204987124-2-81880:}}Can you remind me where the other key fragments are here in Auridon?
{{204987124-2-82112:}}Is this place part of the Scholarium?
{{204987124-0-81804:}}What happens if we don't find all your facets?
{{204987124-0-81922:}}The Indrik helped you find supplies?
{{204987124-2-81909:}}Do all the Luminaries have fables like this?
{{204987124-0-78816:}}Could the relics help? The Lamp of Clarity reveals things and Abolisher opens portals.
{{204987124-0-81801:}}What does the art of Scribing mean to you?
{{204987124-0-81924:}}I wonder if the other Luminaries will help you find scripts and grimoires.
{{204987124-0-81455:}}What do you know about the vineyard and winery?
{{204987124-1-81552:}}Tell me more about what you think King Nantharion is up to.
{{204987124-1-78934:}}I saw an Echonir vision in Hoperoot. A memory of Ithelia heading toward the Outcast Inn.
{{204987124-0-82049:}}What do you think about the Indrik?
{{204987124-0-78843:}}Very well. I'll see you outside Hoperoot.
{{204987124-1-79667:}}It sounds like Molag Bal is actually kind of pathetic, a prisoner of his own nature.
{{204987124-0-79741:}}Constable Ulbren was planning to talk to you. Any idea why?
{{204987124-1-80945:}}I heard what happened with Shalidor and Sheogorath.
{{204987124-2-81723:}}Wood Elf? You mean Beragon? We fought the Recollection at Ostumir.
{{204987124-2-79667:}}I think this is all very confusing.
{{204987124-0-81008:}}Help me understand the Lamp of Clarity's purpose.
{{204987124-1-81268:}}What else should I know about Elenglynn?
{{204987124-1-79432:}}What sort of dangers should I expect inside the ruins?
{{204987124-1-79436:}}He should be more active.
{{204987124-0-80562:}}Why is it called the Outcast Inn?
{{204987124-0-80564:}}What do you think the Recollection's looking for?
{{204987124-3-81512:}}What do you think about the Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-81763:}}Anything else?
{{204987124-0-81766:}}You duel people in Tribute?
{{204987124-0-81765:}}The gods came to her aid?
{{204987124-0-81764:}}What's Mirrormoor? Why is this happening?
{{204987124-1-80544:}}Tell me about the vineyard's new grape.
{{204987124-0-81769:}}Do you have proof that your father was murdered?
{{204987124-1-81639:}}Any idea who that Shardmarshal Vargas is?
{{204987124-1-81635:}}We should go look for her.
{{204987124-0-82073:}}I'll go looking for those notes.
{{204987124-0-79173:}}Can you describe the Many Paths?
{{204987124-0-79172:}}Ithelia asked for a drink called Sage's Dream. She thinks it will help bring her clarity.
{{204987124-0-79176:}}You're jealous of me?
{{204987124-0-79179:}}Ithelia, wait!
{{204987124-0-81187:}}I'll look around.
{{204987124-0-81180:}}Tell me more about this investigator.
{{204987124-0-81639:}}Shardmarshal Vargas. That's the Dremora we fought at Feldagard Keep.
{{204987124-0-81636:}}What does it mean to follow Y'ffre?
{{204987124-0-81633:}}Settled down?
{{204987124-0-80945:}}I'm actually working with the spirit of Shalidor to restore Eyevea.
{{204987124-0-80946:}}I'll place the fable and open the door.
{{204987124-0-80943:}}I'll dispel the ward and free the Gryphon, then.
{{204987124-1-81804:}}Why did your facets run away in the first place?
{{204987124-0-78767:}}What's a greenspring seed?
{{204987124-2-82113:}}Every Luminary has their own domain, their own wing like this?
{{204987124-0-79683:}}What's the Molag Bal Premise?
{{204987124-1-79662:}}What are you two doing out here?
{{204987124-1-79666:}}I was sent here by Commandant Salerius to destroy crates of misprinted invitations.
{{204987124-0-81680:}}The gods came to her aid?
{{204987124-1-81493:}}Can you tell me about yourself?
{{204987124-0-81686:}}Why aren't there many knights in the order?
{{204987124-0-81364:}}You just decided to found a kingdom in West Weald?
{{204987124-0-81856:}}That's why you became a knight in the Order of the Lamp?
{{204987124-0-81851:}}Are we in the Shivering Isles right now?
{{204987124-0-80799:}}Tell me about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-0-80798:}}It's not too late. Elic is waiting for you in Suran.
{{204987124-0-81853:}}Who are the associates you want to bring back?
{{204987124-0-80791:}}Which side do you agree with?
{{204987124-0-80790:}}Which side do you agree with?
{{204987124-0-80793:}}Tell me about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-0-80792:}}What's the Dawnway?
{{204987124-0-80795:}}Which side do you agree with?
{{204987124-0-80794:}}Which side do you agree with?
{{204987124-0-80796:}}Tell me about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-0-78762:}}Will I forget her as well?
{{204987124-0-78766:}}But?
{{204987124-2-82114:}}Is this place part of the Scholarium?
{{204987124-0-81859:}}And Chronicler Firandil?
{{204987124-0-81689:}}Can you tell me more about the Order of the Lamp?
{{204987124-0-81685:}}Did you say you created a Tribute deck?
{{204987124-0-82131:}}Have you forgiven Fennorian for abandoning you when you were betrothed?
{{204987124-1-81405:}}Why are the Luminary keys hidden?
{{204987124-0-78948:}}Right. I'll do that.
{{204987124-1-81907:}}What do you mean she could "see" magic?
{{204987124-1-81905:}}Tell me about Feldagard Keep.
{{204987124-1-81903:}}Why did you lend your power to the fawn?
{{204987124-1-82200:}}You mentioned Draugrkin? Who are they?
{{204987124-2-79805:}}How do you feel about the Green Pact?
{{204987124-2-79800:}}Who is Quatrius Idolus?
{{204987124-0-81331:}}I'll help you rescue the villagers and search for Greenspeaker Sorilen.
{{204987124-0-79245:}}Constable Yabren thinks Baron Carvain or Lady Raxalee are responsible in some way?
{{204987124-0-79242:}}It seems suspicious that both the town healer and Constable Ulbren died from the illness.
{{204987124-0-78688:}}I'm not sure about this, but I guess I need to see the memory, too.
{{204987124-0-78689:}}It's over, Pelena.
{{204987124-0-78680:}}How does it work?
{{204987124-0-78682:}}Can you tell me anything about the Ayleids?
{{204987124-0-80459:}}What do you think we'll find there?
{{204987124-0-80456:}}Naku called him Marcan. He killed Naku with this knife.
{{204987124-0-80457:}}Who do you think survived?
{{204987124-2-81892:}}Where are we?
{{204987124-0-81479:}}So you're going to use the magic we steal to make these watchers?
{{204987124-0-81156:}}If I find him or the bear, I'll bring them here.
{{204987124-0-81157:}}What's it like being the Count of Skingrad?
{{204987124-2-82030:}}What do you think about the Gryphon?
{{204987124-1-80374:}}You chose your form. Why are you an Indrik?
{{204987124-2-82032:}}What do you think about the Gryphon?
{{204987124-3-81637:}}Do you have a special connection to Laeni and Clendagal?
{{204987124-1-78748:}}Why does <<1>> have an interest in ancient stonework?
{{204987124-0-80130:}}What can you tell me about the town of Sutch?
{{204987124-2-81405:}}Can you tell me more about this lens?
{{204987124-0-78330:}}Do a lot of legionaries have experience with Daedra?
{{204987124-0-78331:}}So why are they here now?
{{204987124-0-78333:}}I sense a familiar aura about you.
{{204987124-0-78334:}}Can you tell me more about how to defeat a Mirrormoor incursion?
{{204987124-0-78335:}}Who's Count Calantius?
{{204987124-0-78336:}}How did you get the rank of tribune?
{{204987124-0-78338:}}Where did you get it?
{{204987124-0-78339:}}You don't know if it works?
{{204987124-2-81860:}}We'll speak again when you return.
{{204987124-2-81861:}}We'll speak again when you return.
{{204987124-0-81109:}}How are you involved with the Legion?
{{204987124-0-81108:}}What do you know about the attacking forces?
{{204987124-0-81107:}}How did you get the rank of Tribune?
{{204987124-0-81106:}}How did you get the rank of Tribune?
{{204987124-0-81103:}}Of course, here they are.
{{204987124-0-81102:}}What should we do with the items from the ritual?
{{204987124-0-81101:}}Can you tell me more about Eyevea?
{{204987124-0-80853:}}How do I lead him back?
{{204987124-0-80850:}}Why do cartographers want the arcane knot?
{{204987124-1-81969:}}Shalidor wanted to make a sanctuary for mages?
{{204987124-1-79173:}}What's strange about a mortal entering the Many Paths?
{{204987124-3-82029:}}Can you tell me more about this trial?
{{204987124-0-80164:}}Do you think the farmers can learn to live with the Goblins?
{{204987124-0-79458:}}Is today the first time you spoke of leaving?
{{204987124-0-79459:}}What do they disagree on?
{{204987124-0-79456:}}You're talking about the differences between the Green Pact and the Dawnway?
{{204987124-0-79450:}}So this mosaic would represent your commitment to the village and to your family?
{{204987124-0-79451:}}You said you wanted Laeni and Clendagal to remain in Vashabar. This can make that happen.
{{204987124-2-78967:}}I'm not sure I understand how Ithelia escaped.
{{204987124-0-80007:}}Why not ask one of your colleagues to enter the portal with you? Why seek me out?
{{204987124-1-81805:}}How do you feel now?
{{204987124-1-79067:}}Remind me about the Recollection.
{{204987124-1-81803:}}How do you feel now?
{{204987124-1-81802:}}Why did your facets run away in the first place?
{{204987124-1-81801:}}Can we talk about the Luminaries?
{{204987124-1-81618:}}You mentioned you're a blade dancer?
{{204987124-0-81022:}}I'll watch my step.
{{204987124-0-81987:}}That's why I'm asking if you're a Luminary.
{{204987124-0-79858:}}Why are you interested in Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-79850:}}I've already been to a place you mentioned.
{{204987124-0-79855:}}Good luck.
{{204987124-0-81600:}}I'll go talk to Spinner Belwelas then.
{{204987124-0-81284:}}The Recollection was looking for Ithelia at Elenglynn, but we found her first. Then she vanished.
{{204987124-0-81602:}}How could Spinner Belwelas help?
{{204987124-0-81604:}}Why is Ithelia doing that? If reality is destroyed, she will be too.
{{204987124-1-81779:}}What else can you tell me about Nahlia?
{{204987124-0-80959:}}What can I expect in the sunken ruins?
{{204987124-1-80282:}}On second thought, nevermind.
{{204987124-2-80863:}}You're sure Minth and Nedolir won't object?
{{204987124-2-80862:}}You're sure Minth and Nedolir won't object?
{{204987124-2-80865:}}Why haven't Laeni and Clendagal already performed the rite?
{{204987124-2-80864:}}You're sure Minth and Nedolir won't object?
{{204987124-1-81486:}}Why is protecting people so important to you?
{{204987124-1-81484:}}Can you tell me about yourself?
{{204987124-1-80422:}}How did Xoryn do this much damage on his own?
{{204987124-0-78937:}}That's not all?
{{204987124-0-78934:}}I saw an Echonir vision in Hoperoot. A memory of Ithelia heading toward the Outcast Inn.
{{204987124-0-78933:}}The note says this Groundskeeper Gaius has the only key.
{{204987124-0-78931:}}Here's the map. I'll meet you at your townhouse in Skingrad.
{{204987124-1-80420:}}What did you mean when you said that Keshargo was supposedly in charge?
{{204987124-1-80421:}}How did Xoryn do this much damage on his own?
{{204987124-0-80882:}}If these invitations are for the count, why were the crates sent to Fort Colovia?
{{204987124-0-80887:}}Do you know what Xoryn wants with the arcane knot?
{{204987124-4-81342:}}Are you practicing your new act?
{{204987124-0-80636:}}Why is Nantharion doing all this?
{{204987124-0-80635:}}Shouldn't the Skein of Secrets show us where Ithelia is?
{{204987124-3-78934:}}I saw an Echonir vision in Hoperoot. A memory of Ithelia heading toward the Outcast Inn.
{{204987124-1-80789:}}What's the Dawnway?
{{204987124-1-78679:}}Yes. Do you think we'll find memories here?
{{204987124-0-80364:}}You'll go meet Hooke? He's waiting in the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge.
{{204987124-0-80365:}}So, you'll meet Hooke? He wants you to go to the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge.
{{204987124-0-80362:}}You won't leave without your ring?
{{204987124-0-78601:}}What do you know of Lady Weatherleah's death?
{{204987124-0-78602:}}Why was it too late?
{{204987124-0-78603:}}Magical relics caused this?
{{204987124-0-78604:}}Will you try to retake the town?
{{204987124-0-78606:}}Who found her?
{{204987124-0-78608:}}Are you thinking of trying that yourself?
{{204987124-0-78609:}}Do you have any proof he's lying?
{{204987124-0-79957:}}This house is enormous. It's all yours?
{{204987124-0-79956:}}What do you mean?
{{204987124-0-79955:}}You suspect a tie between the Wood Elves of Vashabar and the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-79954:}}Why come here?
{{204987124-0-79951:}}Hmm.
{{204987124-0-81213:}}How do I do that?
{{204987124-1-80036:}}I'm not sure.
{{204987124-1-81525:}}I met Tribune Alea at the battle for Feldagard Keep.
{{204987124-0-81285:}}What was the Battle for North Hook?
{{204987124-0-81286:}}What do you do for the count?
{{204987124-0-81280:}}That's where you're wrong.
{{204987124-2-81484:}}Why is protecting people so important to you?
{{204987124-1-81669:}}Are you looking forward to the role?
{{204987124-2-80376:}}You mentioned the other Luminaries. What can you tell me about them?
{{204987124-2-81972:}}Why do you think Ulfsild wrote down so little about herself?
{{204987124-0-79364:}}All right. Which way do you want me to go?
{{204987124-0-79367:}}All right, let's do this.
{{204987124-0-79360:}}So Feldagard Keep is safe now?
{{204987124-1-80826:}}Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Clendagal and Laeni are going to leave town.
{{204987124-1-80825:}}Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Clendagal and Laeni are going to leave town.
{{204987124-1-80829:}}Can you tell me a bit more about greenspeakers?
{{204987124-0-81164:}}Yes, Gadayn, we saved West Weald and all of reality.
{{204987124-0-80664:}}How can I understand how you think?
{{204987124-0-80662:}}What kind of a riddle?
{{204987124-0-78635:}}At Ostumir, I learned that the Recollection used a wildburn seed to create the new forest.
{{204987124-0-78634:}}I'll help you deal with the threat of Ithelia. Where do we begin?
{{204987124-0-79246:}}Where can I find the manor and tower?
{{204987124-3-82114:}}Every Luminary has their own domain, their own wing like this?
{{204987124-0-79796:}}Did you try to go through?
{{204987124-0-81607:}}That's a wide range of subjects.
{{204987124-0-81609:}}Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave the village.
{{204987124-0-78681:}}When did you get it?
{{204987124-0-78683:}}But Lady Weatherleah was found in the library?
{{204987124-0-78685:}}So Pelena and the imposter Theophan ….
{{204987124-0-78686:}}Are you sensing the Echonir?
{{204987124-1-81975:}}Can you tell me more about Eyevea?
{{204987124-0-81029:}}Are you a Scribe of Mora?
{{204987124-0-80047:}}Are you really a king?
{{204987124-0-80048:}}You called Beragon the hero of Ninglenirre Pass?
{{204987124-1-78340:}}What are these Aetherial shards used for?
{{204987124-1-78341:}}What are these Aetherial shards used for?
{{204987124-0-79665:}}What happens if the bell isn't rung in the proper sequence?
{{204987124-0-79667:}}Perhaps Molag Bal represents the clash of free will and fate, and is himself suffering.
{{204987124-0-79663:}}I have some thoughts.
{{204987124-0-79669:}}Good to hear.
{{204987124-1-81512:}}What do you make of the Dragon?
{{204987124-0-81879:}}So mages … annoy them?
{{204987124-0-81876:}}Thanks, Chronicler.
{{204987124-0-81875:}}How will you facilitate Scribing?
{{204987124-0-79725:}}You spoke with Constable Ulbren before he died?
{{204987124-0-81612:}}What are you doing?
{{204987124-0-81476:}}An advantage?
{{204987124-0-81473:}}So you're going to run the vineyard and winery?
{{204987124-0-81472:}}About your husband ….
{{204987124-0-81470:}}That's why you helped Ulfsild to perfect the art?
{{204987124-1-82107:}}What makes Scribing work? The grimoires and scripts and ink?
{{204987124-1-82105:}}What makes Scribing work? The grimoires and scripts and ink?
{{204987124-1-82100:}}What makes Scribing work? The grimoires and scripts and ink?
{{204987124-1-82109:}}Why does it look like the Summerset isles?
{{204987124-1-82108:}}Why did Ulfsild develop Scribing?
{{204987124-0-78624:}}Did you see anyone else?
{{204987124-1-78967:}}Why do they call you Leramil the Wise?
{{204987124-0-81615:}}Who threatened you?
{{204987124-0-79045:}}What needs to be done?
{{204987124-0-79047:}}I have more questions.
{{204987124-0-79041:}}So what do we do, then?
{{204987124-3-82112:}}Why does it look like the Summerset isles?
{{204987124-3-82113:}}Why does it look like the Summerset isles?
{{204987124-0-81614:}}What are you doing here?
{{204987124-0-81683:}}You duel people in Tribute?
{{204987124-0-78878:}}What brought you to Niryastare?
{{204987124-0-78583:}}Where will you go now?
{{204987124-0-78582:}}He really did want to marry you.
{{204987124-0-78580:}}Magic twisted this place?
{{204987124-1-80795:}}What's the Dawnway?
{{204987124-0-78585:}}Remind me, what's so special about the wine?
{{204987124-0-81618:}}Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Clendagal and Laeni are going to leave town.
{{204987124-0-81561:}}So what do we do?
{{204987124-0-81560:}}What are you doing here?
{{204987124-0-81563:}}What are you doing here?
{{204987124-0-81569:}}What were you talking about earlier? About the fire, and Caelum Vineyard?
{{204987124-0-82473:}}Where did the brigand run off to?
{{204987124-0-80208:}}You think we can use the relics against Ithelia and her servants?
{{204987124-0-80551:}}Can you help me? I'm looking for a scroll called the Rite of Propagation?
{{204987124-0-80557:}}Why are we responsible for ending this threat?
{{204987124-0-80556:}}What does that mean?
{{204987124-0-80555:}}Ithelia?
{{204987124-0-80554:}}The One Who Knows?
{{204987124-0-81738:}}How is coming up with a riddle a trial?
{{204987124-0-81739:}}Can I ask you questions, to understand you better?
{{204987124-0-81730:}}Why did you choose to be a dragon?
{{204987124-0-81733:}}I have no idea.
{{204987124-1-80513:}}How did you get turned into a vampire?
{{204987124-0-82040:}}What do you need?
{{204987124-0-82045:}}You said you explored Niryastare before?
{{204987124-0-80908:}}Who's going to rule Vashabar now?
{{204987124-1-81723:}}Wood Elf? You mean Beragon?
{{204987124-1-81726:}}I don't care for riddles.
{{204987124-0-81640:}}What do you know about the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-79815:}}Why didn't you try to leave before today?
{{204987124-0-78989:}}That sounds intriguing. What did you find?
{{204987124-0-78988:}}Why are you interested in Rustwall Estate?
{{204987124-0-80017:}}What happened to Archmage Shalidor?
{{204987124-0-78985:}}Why does the ritual need to be stopped?
{{204987124-0-80015:}}What more can you tell me about Ulfsild?
{{204987124-0-80011:}}Why would I do that?
{{204987124-0-80991:}}Fine, but how do they work?
{{204987124-0-80994:}}Why don't you go up to the lights?
{{204987124-0-78730:}}Maybe one day.
{{204987124-0-78731:}}Then will you rebuild?
{{204987124-0-78732:}}What's our next step?
{{204987124-1-81945:}}Can you explain more about the Sage's Dream?
{{204987124-0-80290:}}Why am I starting with the Indrik?
{{204987124-0-80291:}}How did you learn about Ayleid puzzles?
{{204987124-0-80294:}}I'm not sure how the Luminaries connect to Scribing or the altar.
{{204987124-0-80745:}}I'm going to help him resolve these regrets?
{{204987124-1-80497:}}You called Sorilen a Greenspeaker. Tell me about them.
{{204987124-1-80495:}}I need to investigate Rustwall next.
{{204987124-0-81501:}}Where's the Niryastare ruins located?
{{204987124-0-81837:}}Did you try asking the woman to leave?
{{204987124-1-81457:}}That's all I need to know about Ostumir.
{{204987124-1-81450:}}What should I know about Lord Gallio Valente?
{{204987124-1-81459:}}That's all I need to know about Ostumir.
{{204987124-0-80930:}}The energy in the relics has been depleted. What possible purpose could they still have?
{{204987124-0-79985:}}Tribune Alea thinks some of your people might be part of the Recollection.
{{204987124-0-81829:}}Why are we responsible for ending this threat?
{{204987124-0-81566:}}Why did you resort to stealing?
{{204987124-0-81568:}}What led up to everyone fleeing to the catacombs to hide?
{{204987124-0-81831:}}She hasn't made any requests?
{{204987124-0-81039:}}All right, let's get in there.
{{204987124-0-81348:}}You could say that.
{{204987124-0-81341:}}That's quite a story.
{{204987124-0-81036:}}I think I can manage that.
{{204987124-0-80122:}}You're quite involved.
{{204987124-0-79290:}}Pelena Weatherleah?
{{204987124-0-79746:}}Portal? He wants me to return to Apocrypha?
{{204987124-0-79744:}}Who's Baron Carvain?
{{204987124-0-79749:}}Before I go, I have questions.
{{204987124-1-80915:}}Gadayn saved me so we could stop Ithelia. We need to focus on that.
{{204987124-0-80468:}}Then let's go talk to Scruut!
{{204987124-2-81739:}}How can I understand your mind? You're a Luminary of Magic.
{{204987124-1-80291:}}What can you tell me about the last time you were here?
{{204987124-2-61635:}}Have you kept busy since we last met?
{{204987124-1-79460:}}I'm a necromancer, you know.
{{204987124-0-80575:}}And once we're inside?
{{204987124-0-78415:}}What kind of information do you want me to look for?
{{204987124-0-79356:}}What do you want us to do?
{{204987124-0-78349:}}Ithelia has already changed once. Is there some way we could get her to change again?
{{204987124-0-78348:}}You said you and Scruut had an idea?
{{204987124-0-78341:}}What exactly is this Aetherial alarum you gave me?
{{204987124-0-78340:}}What sort of dangers should I expect inside the ruins?
{{204987124-0-78345:}}What's your plan for the Aetherial shards?
{{204987124-0-78344:}}You wanted to help the necromancers?
{{204987124-2-81829:}}What drew you here, Leramil?
{{204987124-1-82029:}}You've mentioned Ulfsild several times. What did she mean to you?
{{204987124-0-79126:}}I'll go get water from the well for you.
{{204987124-0-79127:}}Why do you call them shadows?
{{204987124-0-79124:}}She hasn't made any requests?
{{204987124-0-79128:}}He's studying statues right now. Couldn't budge him. You should go on without him.
{{204987124-3-82012:}}What do I have to do in Hermaeus Mora's realm?
{{204987124-3-82010:}}What do I have to do in Mehrunes Dagon's realm?
{{204987124-0-80863:}}What is it that you do in Vashabar?
{{204987124-0-80862:}}Why haven't Laeni and Clendagal already performed the rite?
{{204987124-0-80865:}}What is it that you do in Vashabar?
{{204987124-0-80864:}}What is it that you do in Vashabar?
{{204987124-0-79467:}}Laeni seemed sure they wouldn't change their minds.
{{204987124-0-79466:}}I'll give them the jagga and see what they have to say. See you at the stables.
{{204987124-0-79460:}}Are you thinking of becoming a necromancer?
{{204987124-0-80855:}}Tell me about this bear.
{{204987124-0-79468:}}Sounds exciting.
{{204987124-1-80855:}}How did you get your injuries?
{{204987124-1-80890:}}Who are you?
{{204987124-2-81678:}}Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)
{{204987124-3-81973:}}What do you mean by strong personality? Stronger than the Netch?
{{204987124-3-81974:}}Here, take a look at the fable. Do you have suggestions on where I should go?
{{204987124-0-81907:}}If she could see magic why did she need the lens?
{{204987124-0-81905:}}What do you know about the attacking forces?
{{204987124-0-81904:}}Can you tell me something about the Dragon?
{{204987124-0-81903:}}How would you describe the Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-81902:}}Can you tell me something about the Dragon?
{{204987124-0-81901:}}What is the Netch like?
{{204987124-0-81900:}}If it's so simple why is Scribing a lost art?
{{204987124-0-81909:}}What do you mean she could "see" magic?
{{204987124-2-81945:}}I'm curious about a different topic.
{{204987124-2-81941:}}I'm curious about a different topic.
{{204987124-2-81943:}}I'm curious about a different topic.
{{204987124-1-78801:}}You said the letter mentioned survivors ….
{{204987124-0-81716:}}What do you mean? They knew they wouldn't be together forever?
{{204987124-0-81717:}}You said the Luminaries could teach me about Scribing?
{{204987124-0-81715:}}You called this place the Scholarium? Where are we?
{{204987124-2-82031:}}What do you make of the Dragon?
{{204987124-0-81718:}}What are you going to do about the remaining Daedra and Recollection cultists beneath Rustwall?
{{204987124-2-82033:}}What do you make of the Dragon?
{{204987124-1-79699:}}Is the Imperial Legion really stretched so thin that you have to hire mercenaries?
{{204987124-1-81624:}}Why can't you just get married? Ignore what your fathers think.
{{204987124-2-82034:}}What does the art of Scribing mean to you?
{{204987124-2-80410:}}Is there anything else you can tell me about the Lucent Citadel?
{{204987124-2-82036:}}What does the art of Scribing mean to you?
{{204987124-0-80210:}}What about the Lamp of Clarity?
{{204987124-0-80211:}}And what does the Skein do?
{{204987124-0-80212:}}You're not coming to Niryastare?
{{204987124-0-80213:}}How did you learn about Ayleid puzzles?
{{204987124-0-80214:}}What became of your company?
{{204987124-0-80215:}}I met your niece in the city.
{{204987124-0-80216:}}You could go to the Outcast Inn.
{{204987124-1-81899:}}You mentioned the other Luminaries. What can you tell me about them?
{{204987124-0-80679:}}So am I or am I not?
{{204987124-0-81671:}}Are you going to stay here with Nahlia?
{{204987124-0-81675:}}The chaotic magic when we first arrived here. Was that because of you?
{{204987124-0-81674:}}The chaotic magic when we first arrived here. Was that because of you?
{{204987124-0-81677:}}Are you going to stay here with Nahlia?
{{204987124-0-81676:}}Do you think you lived up to that destiny?
{{204987124-1-81892:}}Why are you having me do these particular challenges?
{{204987124-0-79861:}}What happened to Ithelia?
{{204987124-0-79860:}}What kind of secrets?
{{204987124-0-80980:}}What caused your personality to split?
{{204987124-0-80981:}}Why were you experimenting with Daedric magic?
{{204987124-0-80982:}}What caused your personality to split?
{{204987124-0-80984:}}What's going on here, Ithelia?
{{204987124-0-80985:}}How will I know what the arcane knot looks like?
{{204987124-0-80986:}}Are you talking about protecting the Scholarium?
{{204987124-0-81582:}}Are you sure you'll be all right on your own?
{{204987124-0-81586:}}Good luck with the wedding, Laeni.
{{204987124-1-80414:}}Who is Xoryn?
{{204987124-0-82012:}}Hermaeus Mora? Where are we stealing his creatia?
{{204987124-0-78902:}}What should I know about the Terror of the Weald and his gang of vampires?
{{204987124-0-78901:}}Why do you think Balandrus came back here?
{{204987124-0-78900:}}And Tham owns the tavern?
{{204987124-0-78275:}}Very well, I'll search Fyrelight for your dowry.
{{204987124-0-81934:}}Where are we?
{{204987124-0-81935:}}I'm moving on. Will you hire a new deputy?
{{204987124-0-81932:}}I'm ready to enter the next Path.
{{204987124-0-81933:}}You've never heard of the ingredients in that recipe?
{{204987124-0-81931:}}I'm ready to enter the next Path.
{{204987124-3-78967:}}How do we stop Ithelia if we find her?
{{204987124-2-78654:}}Legionary Calvo demanded to stay behind. He felt it was his duty to the Legion and his cohort.
{{204987124-2-81899:}}Where are we?
{{204987124-0-79211:}}What can you tell me about Yabren's father?
{{204987124-1-80992:}}What if the ghost lights don't do anything?
{{204987124-1-80994:}}What if the ghost lights don't do anything?
{{204987124-0-78679:}}The relic you gave me? Yes. What does it do again?
{{204987124-0-78678:}}Are you saying Edric didn't write this?
{{204987124-0-78675:}}Are you accusing Otho of aiding with the murder?
{{204987124-0-80394:}}[Warn Narsis] Narsis, wait!
{{204987124-0-80399:}}What's the difference between a tribune and a captain?
{{204987124-0-79980:}}Let's go question the imposter Uriel.
{{204987124-0-79981:}}Where exactly did you see this covered cart?
{{204987124-0-79982:}}Where does Lady Weatherleah take her tea?
{{204987124-0-79983:}}How did you grow this forest so quickly?
{{204987124-0-79986:}}What then?
{{204987124-0-79987:}}See you there.
{{204987124-3-82014:}}What do I have to do in Hermaeus Mora's realm?
{{204987124-0-78584:}}I better get back to Grander. Goodbye, Amaurel.
{{204987124-1-80790:}}Tell me about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-1-80791:}}What's the Dawnway?
{{204987124-1-80793:}}What's the Dawnway?
{{204987124-1-80794:}}Tell me about the Green Pact.
{{204987124-0-79203:}}I'll ask the innkeeper to make a Sage's Dream for you.
{{204987124-0-79200:}}Why do you think the Wood Elves can't be trusted?
{{204987124-0-79204:}}How old is Skingrad?
{{204987124-1-79957:}}Remind me about the Recollection.
{{204987124-0-81368:}}Remind me of what your reflection said about the Lamp of Clarity.
{{204987124-0-81150:}}What about Luther? Will he recover?
{{204987124-0-81151:}}What's it like being the Count of Skingrad?
{{204987124-0-81152:}}How so?
{{204987124-0-81154:}}What's next for you and Sergeant Luther?
{{204987124-0-81155:}}And your customers?
{{204987124-1-80370:}}What's that about a new forest?
{{204987124-1-80371:}}Can you tell me more about Scribing? What it means to you?
{{204987124-1-81029:}}What were you doing for the expedition?
{{204987124-1-80962:}}Do you think you can stabilize the arcane knot?
{{204987124-2-81382:}}What happened back there when the knot fractured?
{{204987124-0-79395:}}You deserted? Aren't you afraid of getting caught?
{{204987124-0-79394:}}And that's why you sent a Legion cohort here?
{{204987124-0-79396:}}So what are your plans?
{{204987124-0-79391:}}Is King Nantharion here?
{{204987124-0-79390:}}Why were you were hunting the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-79392:}}You said Recollection forces were close. Where?
{{204987124-1-78270:}}I'd like to know more about who attacked you.
{{204987124-1-78274:}}You've never met your bride?
{{204987124-1-78275:}}I'd like to know more about who attacked you.
{{204987124-2-80008:}}All right, I'm ready to head through that portal.
{{204987124-2-78934:}}I saw an Echonir vision in Hoperoot. A memory of Ithelia heading toward the Outcast Inn.
{{204987124-1-81738:}}Can't I ask you an impossible riddle right now? Like, what happened to the Dwarves?
{{204987124-0-81989:}}Can you go anywhere you want?
{{204987124-0-81988:}}You were stealing food?
{{204987124-0-81986:}}Are you a Luminary, like the Gryphon?
{{204987124-0-81985:}}I just want to restore the Scholarium and master Scribing.
{{204987124-0-81984:}}I just want to restore the Scholarium and master Scribing.
{{204987124-1-81858:}}Can me tell me more about your Order?
{{204987124-0-80637:}}You won't keep researching Goblins?
{{204987124-0-80634:}}Any word from Leramil the Wise?
{{204987124-0-80631:}}Have you set a date for the wedding yet?
{{204987124-1-81730:}}Why are you so focused on riddles and the mind?
{{204987124-2-81671:}}The chaotic magic when we first arrived here. Was that because of you?
{{204987124-0-81194:}}Let's get going, then.
{{204987124-0-81217:}}Now it's Betu who will receive the fortune.
{{204987124-0-81215:}}We'll see it done.
{{204987124-0-81214:}}But you killed him too.
{{204987124-1-81677:}}Why didn't you tell us you were a Luminary sooner?
{{204987124-0-78643:}}Have you tried the wine? What does it taste like?
{{204987124-2-80036:}}No.
{{204987124-0-80103:}}I'm committed, Nahlia. Let's get to it.
{{204987124-1-78578:}}Why hide with these beasts in Fyrelight Cave?
{{204987124-1-81970:}}Shalidor wanted to make a sanctuary for mages?
{{204987124-1-79858:}}What can you tell me about Elenglynn?
{{204987124-0-79764:}}What's next for you, Scruut?
{{204987124-1-79850:}}Tell me about these sites you want me to investigate.
{{204987124-0-79015:}}So what should we do?
{{204987124-0-82474:}}I'll search Fyrelight Cave for your stolen dowry.
{{204987124-0-80900:}}Is there anything I can do to help?
{{204987124-0-80901:}}Nahlia and I are working with the Luminaries to restore the Scholarium.
{{204987124-0-80902:}}All right, let's see it then.
{{204987124-0-80903:}}You'll give me back the pages for the fable?
{{204987124-0-80906:}}Can I ask you some questions?
{{204987124-0-80907:}}I will gather the flowers for you.
{{204987124-0-80909:}}Your primary self is looking for you.
{{204987124-1-81720:}}Let's play Tribute. (|t32:32:EsoUI/Art/Icons/ServiceMapPins/servicePin_TalesOfTribute.dds|t)
{{204987124-0-79761:}}I'll go talk to Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee.
{{204987124-0-79763:}}Right. So what will you do next, Leramil?
{{204987124-2-80834:}}Can I ask you some questions about the Rite of Propagation?
{{204987124-2-80835:}}Can I ask you some questions about the Rite of Propagation?
{{204987124-0-80016:}}What do you mean? They knew they wouldn't be together forever?
{{204987124-0-80012:}}Where do they come from?
{{204987124-0-80013:}}Why was the island lost?
{{204987124-0-78981:}}Can we use the Lamp of Clarity to find them?
{{204987124-2-81738:}}How can I understand your mind? You're a Luminary of Magic.
{{204987124-0-81825:}}Why would Greenspeaker Sorilen join the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-81826:}}I'm ready to go. Let's see what's on the other side of that portal.
{{204987124-0-81827:}}Is that what made you sign up?
{{204987124-0-81821:}}It was good working with you, Nahlia.
{{204987124-0-81828:}}Why would Greenspeaker Sorilen join the Recollection?
{{204987124-0-81431:}}What does he do?
{{204987124-0-81430:}}He's going to be selling the things we find here?
{{204987124-0-81435:}}Of course. Take the blade.
{{204987124-2-78336:}}Who was Quatrius Idolus?
{{204987124-0-81637:}}Ciiril asked me to speak with you. Laeni and Clendagal are going to leave town.
{{204987124-0-78824:}}If Ithelia went back to her own realm, why is fate fraying?
{{204987124-0-78828:}}The note suggested they stowed Grivier in the stables. Let's go see.
{{204987124-0-78829:}}Maerenah isn't part of the gang anymore. And she's no longer a vampire.
{{204987124-0-80319:}}What happens then?
{{204987124-0-80318:}}I'll look for the echo in the east wing, then.
{{204987124-0-82200:}}What can you tell me about this place?
{{204987124-0-79018:}}Tell me more about the Recollection.
{{204987124-0-79019:}}That's four retainers. Who was the fifth?
{{204987124-0-79017:}}Who's King Dynar?
{{204987124-0-79010:}}All right, I'll keep the Echonir handy.
{{204987124-0-79011:}}Ithelia protected the Loom? How?
{{204987124-0-78820:}}Why not?

{{116521668-0-16956:}}I hoped to tell Marcan Caelum how sorry I am. To atone at the cost of my life, if that's what he chose. But death is no way to make peace with our deeds. It's up to us to find a better path.\n\nYou gave the Scarlets that chance, friend. Thanks.
{{116521668-0-16957:}}I … I suppose you're right. After twenty years, that evil night is finally over. I only wish Caelum had taken me instead.\n\nSorry, friend. Your payment, as promised. The Scarlets owe you more than coin. Now the others need me. And I need them.
{{116521668-0-16509:}}Ah, let me see. Traps, crumbling walls, Ayleid spirits … yes, yes, just what I expected.\n\nI suppose we'll need to delay the renovation project until we can spare a cohort to clear the place out. Ah, well. So it goes. Here's your pay.
{{116521668-0-16415:}}By saving Skingrad and Vashabar from Nantharion's designs, you taught both sides to stand against a common enemy. Whatever comes next, all the people of West Weald will face it together. I thank you for that.\n\nIt's not much, but please, take this.
{{116521668-0-16413:}}We exposed Nantharion as leader of the Recollection. When Vashabar hears about this, they'll tear the crown from his head. He can lead the Recollection, but he can't hide anymore. And we saved Skingrad from a wildburn.\n\nHere, friend. You earned this.
{{116521668-0-16458:}}A patrol to last a lifetime. I brought you in to help with an unstable portal, and look at everything we've done. Explored an ancient library, met a talking crow. And apparently revived an ancient form of magic?\n\nCan't wait to see what happens next.
{{116521668-0-16948:}}That's tomorrow's problem, friend. You stopped the Recollection and you held back the forces of Mirrormoor. The people of West Weald can handle what's left of Ithelia's servants. We're free to find our own way forward now.\n\nThanks to you.
{{116521668-0-16421:}}I can't thank you enough. You, and the Singer, helped us make our dream come true. Without you, who knows where Clen and I would have ended up?\n\nI'll pray for you, traveler. Y'ffre keep and protect you for all the rest of your days.
{{116521668-0-16423:}}Do not downplay your role either, friend! You forget, Mizzik was a bumbling mess chasing a sneeze-inducing beast—ahem, Betu—until you arrived.\n\nYou deserve a reward for your work, but know that this one is in your debt.
{{116521668-0-16425:}}I predicted that the tangled threads of fate were related to Ithelia's release, but how could I know she was the direct cause?\n\nYou have served the One Who Knows very well in this effort. Here is the reward I promised.
{{116521668-0-16426:}}I've never seen a seed like this before. It feels wrong. You're working with Leramil, right? She needs to know what we discovered here. Meet us back in Skingrad. I have a townhouse there.\n\nOh, and take this. You more than deserve it for helping me.
{{116521668-0-16429:}}Ursilia is set on taking control and turning the vineyard and winery into a profitable enterprise. I have no doubt she'll succeed. \n\nAnd speaking of succeeding, your help was invaluable in stopping Lord Gallio. Please, take this with my thanks.
{{116521668-0-16978:}}With Ithelia free and more in control of her power, she still poses a threat. If you have an interest, come to Skingrad and meet with me again. We have more work ahead of us.\n\nIn the meantime, here is the promised reward. With my thanks.
{{116521668-0-16926:}}A reward? Of course! On behalf of Skingrad, take this as your reward.\n\nAnd Legionary Luther must be rewarded too. He deserves a promotion! I'll need to check my budgets—oh, what am I saying? I'm the Count of Skingrad! Of course he gets promoted!
{{116521668-0-16501:}}Gods, they certainly smell rather Reachy. But if returning these baubles to Caddach's diplomat will please the count, then I too am pleased.\n\nNow, take this for your troubles. I suspect you will find it more valuable than what you have just given me.
{{116521668-0-16504:}}Oh, that is good news! If word of the insults contained in that invitation reached Count Calantius, heads would have rolled—specifically, mine.\n\nThe Legion appreciates your efforts and hopes you find this compensation acceptable. And so do I.
{{116521668-0-16915:}}Of course! Just look around. You've made a huge impact on the Scholarium. You took another big step forward in your journey to master scribing. \n\nAnd, of course, you re-united two old friends. You should be proud, adventurer.
{{116521668-0-16514:}}Admirable work. I'm not happy our assumption about the legionaries proved true, but it's better to know their fate and to have their armaments back under our control than to let an unfinished report linger.\n\nHere, take this. You earned it.
{{116521668-0-16518:}}I am glad to hear it. Until we understand how these Daedra are invading our realm, we will continue to monitor any new threats. And I am sure my superiors will continue to expect me to work magic with our resources until then.\n\nHere, your payment.
{{116521668-0-16861:}}That's excellent! This one was a little worried that the null arca would not clear away all of the knot's effects, but it appears to have done its job. And so have you. You earned this reward. \n\nTake it, from Hermorah and myself!
{{116521668-0-16520:}}Oh, these are wonderful! It will take me some time to make sense of it all, but I see orders of battle, supply lines, correspondence concerning potential targets—this is a gold mine! And you took out a few leaders? Remarkable.\n\nYou earned this.
{{116521668-0-16522:}}That's perfect! Hopefully the warnings will be enough to keep everyone away until I can dispatch a Legion cohort to clean out any lingering dangers. The nobles will have to survive without visiting the lake for a while.\n\nHere's your payment.
{{116521668-0-16416:}}That's tomorrow's problem, friend. You stopped the Recollection and you held back the forces of Mirrormoor. The people of West Weald can handle what's left of Ithelia's servants. We're free to find our own way forward now.\n\nThanks to you.
{{116521668-0-16489:}}Oh, how beautiful. If they turn out to be harmless, I might actually keep one of these. But thank you. The last thing West Weald needs right now is a new poisonous insect flittering about.\n\nHere, I'm sure this compensation is adequate.
{{116521668-0-16659:}}Ah, the Emblem! Excellent. And Narsis? He'll be along soon, I expect. My dear Narsis is always getting stuck somewhere. Here you go. I think this should cover your time and effort. Thank you.
{{116521668-0-16417:}}Yes. He most definitely would. I can see the threads of fate coalescing to a point. We near the end of this path and whatever awaits us.\n\nYou have done well as fate's chosen. Take this reward and gather yourself. I shall do the same.
{{116521668-0-16821:}}Excellent work, adventurer! I knew we could count on you. Each Daedric incursion we defeat brings us one step closer to victory in this strange war.\n\nHere, you earned this reward. And the gratitude of the West Weald Legion.
{{116521668-0-16412:}}That the Recollection and the Mirrormoor Daedra seek to restore Ithelia to power. They caused the new forest and wildburn devastation. And Ithelia wanders West Weald, starting to remember.\n\nFor helping me reach these conclusions, take this reward.
{{116521668-0-16860:}}That's excellent! This one was a little worried that the null arca would not clear away all of the knot's effects, but it appears to have done its job. And so have you. You earned this reward. \n\nTake it, from Hermorah and myself!
{{116521668-0-16819:}}I feel the same way. Just look at all the lives you made brighter. The altar is another wing stronger. And we reunited a man and his son for one final day together.\n\nThe Netch's antics were kind of moving. All because of you, my friend.
{{116521668-0-16862:}}That's excellent! This one was a little worried that the null arca would not clear away all of the knot's effects, but it appears to have done its job. And so have you. You earned this reward. \n\nTake it, from Hermorah and myself!
{{116521668-0-16495:}}Hmm. Perhaps a bit lighter than when we loaned them out, but these things happen. I shall catalog the contents and return them to the storehouse. They will be available to requisition again soon.\n\nMany thanks, mercenary. Your payment, as promised.
{{116521668-0-16491:}}You have my gratitude. Knowing you stopped the Recollection's ritual will help me sleep easier. Of course, who has time to sleep these days? I certainly don't.\n\nHere's your payment. Take it with the thanks of the Legion.
{{116521668-0-16493:}}Excellent work, adventurer! I knew we could count on you. Each Daedric incursion we defeat brings us one step closer to victory in this strange war.\n\nHere, you earned this reward. And the gratitude of the West Weald Legion.
{{116521668-0-16424:}}With the portal closed and the Daedra on the run, the remaining Recollection forces aren't enough to threaten Skingrad. But I'll get the Legion to send more soldiers, just in case.\n\nHere. The pay I promised. The Legion always makes good on its debts.
{{116521668-0-16679:}}I'll present the evidence we collected to the magistrate in Skingrad. Help determine who takes over the ranch and quarry. Ontus needs those businesses to continue, though without the danger of fatigue fever.\n\nHere's your pay, deputy, with my thanks.
{{116521668-0-16419:}}Do not tease me with nonsense words, friend. I am just grateful that Gadayn has been returned to us. And that the One Who Knows has given me one more reward to bestow upon you.\n\nNow let us allow Beragon to make his speech and celebrate our success.
{{116521668-0-16418:}}Ithelia is gone and can never return, but the damage she caused to reality may still be a concern.\n\nFor the moment, let us reflect on what this victory has cost us. And take this reward, in recognition of your efforts. The One Who Knows insists.
{{116521668-0-16414:}}Leramil believes these relics are the key to defeating Ithelia and her Recollection and Daedric allies. Oh, we still need to figure out when and how to use them. But thanks to you we have what we need to save West Weald.\n\nTake this, friend.
{{116521668-0-16488:}}Excellent. If you prefer to work alone, talk to <<1>>. If you prefer to work as part of a team, find <<2>>. If you wish to test your mettle against truly monstrous foes, speak to <<3>>.\n\nAnd take this. An incentive for … well, your incentive.
{{116521668-0-16877:}}A report? You didn't read it, did you? No matter. My report supersedes Ulrath's anyway. At least that Orc got what he deserved. How dare he contradict … er, disobey my orders.\n\nHere, the mercenary pay I promised. You earned it.
{{116521668-0-16944:}}The altar is completely restored, every wing of the Scholarium is open and humming with power. And it's all thanks to you. \n\nTogether you and I returned Scribing, returned Ulfsild's legacy, to the world. I can't wait to see what you make of it.
{{116521668-0-16433:}}Great! Well! That was easy. Guess the world's lucky we're not both necromancers or we'd be able to claim these ruins for ourselves!\n\nNot that I want that. Obviously. Who wants to be a necromancer? Anyway, here's your reward.
{{116521668-0-16431:}}Tham? Right. I need to be here for him, the way he was for me. Help him, whether he decides to remain a vampire or seek the cure. It's the least I can do.\n\nRemember, I don't like owing favors. So take this. I want you to have it. For all your help.
{{116521668-0-16438:}}While I don't appreciate the chosen imagery, I get your meaning. Yes. Though, the long road to betrothal is a lonely path, I'll gladly walk it.\n\nThank you, traveler. You've earned this gold as well as my deep respect.
{{116521668-0-16864:}}It's a good thing you did not keep this. See the light? Spirits and soul magic are not unknown phenomena, but they are not well documented. Keshargo doesn't know what Xoryn and his necromancers were capable of.\n\nHere. A reward for your good sense.
{{116521668-0-16866:}}She flatters me, but she is right. I know exactly what happened. It's that fool Xoryn's fault. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nYou came here out of curiosity. That's a value I like to encourage. Accept this as payment for showing interest.
{{116521668-0-16913:}}Ulrath is a deserter? The coward! But that makes things simpler. Not that they'd ever take the word of a legionary over a captain. I'll make sure his report receives all the attention it deserves.\n\nHere, the mercenary pay I promised. You earned it.
{{116521668-0-16859:}}Really? Marcien's always so careful, although I guess that explains why I didn't hear from them for so long. I'm just glad they're safe.\n\nThank you for everything, traveler. Please, take this. May the stars guide you on your journey.
{{116521668-0-16857:}}Ah, clever Marcien! Thank you for this, traveler. I've been waiting a long time for this guzzard. It's a tough one, you can tell by the thick leather of its wings. Such a handsome creature, reminds me of Belkarth.\n\nHere, a token of my gratitude.
{{116521668-0-16856:}}Oh, thank you! Just look at this little darling! I always wanted to raise a guzzard by hand.\n\nI'd almost given up on Marcien. I should've known they'd find a way to finish the job. Please, take this for your trouble.
{{116521668-0-16852:}}I hoped to tell Caelum how sorry I am. To let him know I grieved too, every day. Bring him some peace, perhaps. But I guess the only peace he could find was in death.\n\nThe Scarlets have a chance to find a different peace now. Thank you, friend.
{{116521668-0-16817:}}Incredible. With the Dragon's power amplifying the altar who knows what secrets you'll uncover out there in the world? \n\nWe pulled together, solved her puzzles, and followed fully in Ulfsild's footsteps. Not bad for a knight's work.
{{116521668-0-16516:}}Well, that's a load off my mind. This should discourage the Goblin tribes from attempting anymore foolish schemes. Of course, I still must deal with the paperwork.\n\nBut my burdens aren't yours. Here's your payment.
{{116521668-0-16929:}}I suppose you're right. Refusing to acknowledge this facet is what allowed it to fester and grow so angry in the first place. \n\nThank you. Please, take this token of my gratitude. I know what I need to do now.
{{116521668-0-16858:}}Oh, Versidue! My sweet little scaly friend, I was so lonely without him! \n\nThank you, traveler. You don't know what it means to have Versidue by my side again. Please, take this. It's the least I can do.
{{116521668-0-16427:}}Excellent. I've arranged payment for your efforts. Did Narsis come with you? I know, probably still taking notes for his next dissertation, I expect. Should I go after him? Eventually, I suppose. He gets cross with me when I fuss about him too much.
{{116521668-0-16774:}}That's an excellent question. It depends on which cohorts are nearby and what else they may be dealing with. I hear we've been having trouble with Wood Elves and Daedra recently, you know.\n\nHere's the payment I promised, courtesy of the Legion.
{{116521668-0-16937:}}With the portal closed and the Daedra on the run, the remaining Recollection forces aren't enough to threaten Skingrad. But I'll get the Legion to send more soldiers, just in case.\n\nHere. The pay I promised. The Legion always makes good on its debts.
{{116521668-0-16440:}}Excellent. Now we wait for Legion reinforcements to arrive. Given the current state of the Weald, that could take time, but at least the warning has gone out.\n\nThank you for completing this mission for our fallen comrade. Take this for your service.
{{116521668-0-16441:}}I think they trust me! This is such a breakthrough for my research. See how they're not attacking us. That's proof that they're not hostile anymore. \n\nI couldn't have done this without your help. Thank you. Please accept this.
{{116521668-0-16507:}}Well done! I'm not squeamish, but the claws and fangs of this unnatural beast make my skin crawl. I'll deliver them to a Legion mage and let them deal with it. Hopefully, they'll tell us much about the creatures.\n\nNow take this with my thanks.
{{116521668-0-16863:}}It's a good thing you did not keep this. See the light? Spirits and soul magic are not unknown phenomena, but they are not well documented. Keshargo doesn't know what Xoryn and his necromancers were capable of.\n\nHere. A reward for your good sense.
{{116521668-0-16430:}}I'll help bury the dead and then take Abolisher to Skingrad. Maybe Leramil or Beragon can make sense of it.\n\nI want you to know I appreciate your help here, comrade. Take this and consider your commission with the Legion over. For now.
{{116521668-0-16865:}}It looks like light is moving under the surface even as Keshargo holds it still. This glass is not like anything Keshargo has seen before. He'll bring it to Scrivener's Hall as a precaution. \n\nYou could have sold it. Keshargo will reward you instead.
{{116521668-0-16436:}}Gods, Haldain …. I have to look into his death. Figure out what happened and find justice where I can. \n\nBut that will be my battle. Thank you for finding me. I hope Haldain's at peace. Take this, with both of our thanks.
{{116521668-0-16437:}}Thank you, friend. As promised, here is a token of my gratitude. Hopefully, our paths may meet again under less grim circumstances. Now, I need a hot bath to wash off the stink of the grave. By the smell of it, you could use one, too.
{{116521668-0-16435:}}Now we can finish our trek to market and sell the wine as planned. In addition to turning Ruri over to the authorities, I'll also let the Legion know what's going on in these caves.\n\nYou recovered my inventory when I though all was lost. Thank you!
{{116521668-0-16434:}}If you hadn't arrived when you did, the skies would be much darker. Leftwheal, and myself, owe you a great debt, traveler. A debt that this reward only begins to pay.
{{116521668-0-16439:}}That's an excellent question. It depends on which cohorts are nearby and what else they may be dealing with. I hear we've been having trouble with Wood Elves and Daedra recently, you know.\n\nHere's the payment I promised, courtesy of the Legion.
{{116521668-0-16972:}}I've never seen anything quite like this. It feels wrong. I need to do some research. If you make it to Skingrad, look me up. I have a townhouse there.\n\nOh, and here's the pay I promised. I always try to help my friends. Especially the good ones.
{{116521668-0-16973:}}I'll help bury the dead and then take Abolisher to Skingrad. I know someone who might be able to tell us more about it.\n\nAs for you? Your service to the Legion is done. For now, at least. Here's the pay I promised. Take it with my thanks.
{{116521668-0-16763:}}Magnus be praised. We've secured supplies for a full-fledged expedition, you've allied with your first Luminary, and the altar surges with new power. Not bad for a day's work.

{{3952276-0-8765:}}You rarely hear about solitary necromancers, do you? They always travel in groups. Must be good at making friends.\n\nI'm no match against them, but Master Lucianos is going to rend me into a fine powder if I return empty-handed. Again.
{{3952276-0-8767:}}Beasts, rogues, a horrible buzzing. It all happened so fast. Legion's Rest has always been a safe place to spend the night. Ruri, my caravan master, confirmed as much when he scouted ahead, but look at us! \n\nStranger, I desperately need your help.
{{3952276-0-8766:}}The Recollection have flooded the streets with horrid creatures, though I haven't a clue as to how they entered the city. My focus thus far has been on evacuating as many townsfolk as I can.\n\nYou look like the capable sort. Might I enlist your help?
{{3952276-0-8761:}}It isn't just any auction. It's run by and for vampires. Being a vampire myself, I can't help but wonder why Lord Gallio Valente, vineyard owner and vampire coven leader, wants to sell wine to other vampires. It's not like we partake of the stuff.
{{3952276-0-8763:}}Bloodsuckers, pale skins, night hunters. Whatever you call them, this particular crew has left a trail of corpses in their wake. Get too close and your lifeless husk will get added to the heap.\n\nI should know. I used to run with this lot.
{{3952276-0-8762:}}Daedric forces seek to overwhelm the Legion cohort defending the keep. The legionaries here are capable, but there's something about this attack ….\n\nWe can't let the keep fall. I need to get inside and help them!
{{3952276-1-8914:}}Must I repeat myself? You saw my fear earlier.\n\nI don't miss my stupid whims, but I'm not myself without my facets. They're running wild and now they won't return to me. Maybe a stranger could convince them to come back. I'll make it worth your time.
{{3952276-0-8841:}}Right to business? Of course.\n\nTribune Alea and Beragon await your arrival at the Wood Elf's townhouse in Skingrad. He fears that Nantharion and the Recollection are about to do something terrible, but he may have a way to find them.
{{3952276-0-8746:}}I won't know for sure until I finish deciphering Nantharion's notes. But Ithelia is still at large, the Daedric incursions haven't stopped, and Recollection forces are thick as hoarvors on carrion around Ayleid ruins.\n\nThey're looking for something.
{{3952276-0-8745:}}I'm not a greenspeaker or a spinner, but I know a corrupted seed when I see one. If we can trace it to its source, I think we can find the Recollection.\n\nLuckily, there are experts on this sort of thing close by. In the Wood Elf town of Vashabar.
{{3952276-0-8744:}}A secretive and violent order called the Recollection scours ruins throughout the Weald. Strange Daedric creatures harry the region. And the Wood Elf, King Nantharion, reigns over a newly grown forest—a sure sign the threads of fate have frayed.
{{3952276-0-8749:}}Instabilities! Places where the threads of fate fray and shred. And it's getting worse! I sense one forming in West Weald even now. But this one feels … different.\n\nAddressing anomalies of fate is my sacred duty, but these scare even me!
{{3952276-0-8748:}}Shardmarshal Vargas clearly intends to conquer West Weald for her Prince. She made that quite apparent at Feldagard Keep. But there may be another motive for the incursions. If Vargas keeps us busy here, we can't interfere with Ithelia's plans.
{{3952276-1-8788:}}Only that he's using strange mushrooms that grow in the jungle to power his ritual. I suggest you take this torch and find some allies, then burn the mushrooms and deal with the spinner. You can find him in Fall's Glade to the southwest of Skingrad.
{{3952276-1-8771:}}It happened so fast, the Legion has no idea we're in trouble. I need someone to accompany Legionary Calvo inside, reach the bell tower, and ring the warning signal.\n\nIf you're willing to take the job, Calvo can show you where to find what you need.
{{3952276-1-8770:}}She disappeared into the nearby Fyrelight Cave. Adventurer, if you can recover my four dowry bundles, I promise to make it worth your while. Every scrap of silk and muddied jewel could save me from becoming the laughingstock of Skingrad.
{{3952276-1-8773:}}If searching through a few Goblin camps to see what's upsetting them is all it takes to stop a tragedy from happening, I'll do it. Come with me? There's a Bitterfish camp not too far.\n\nI have some funding left over, you can have it if you help.
{{3952276-1-8778:}}For now. Power draws mages like moths to a flame, we're a little hopeless that way. \n\nVotary Nahlia, a knight from the Order of the Lamp, is on the scene. She needs someone to help her explore this anomaly and assess the danger. What do you say?
{{3952276-0-8896:}}My uncle, Octavius, is going to hire some hunters to cull the Goblins. But the Goblins haven't done anything deserving a full cull yet.\n\nPim says there's a reason for the Goblins' behavior and I believe her.
{{3952276-0-8895:}}West Weald is under attack! Daedric incursions from a realm called Mirrormoor are laying waste to the countryside. As soon as the West Weald Legion repels one incursion, Mirrormoor's forces launch a new one somewhere else.\n\nWe need help.
{{3952276-0-8899:}}Almo and Regnir. Comrades in my Legion days, then fellow outlaws after. We called ourselves the Scarlets.\n\nSorry. The name's Hooke. Back when the Gold Road was rich, I led the gang. But we got caught. Did our time. We're not thieves anymore.
{{3952276-0-8917:}}Well, it's not like the tribune shares all the details with a mere legionary. All I know is what I was given in my orders. And that she promised to compensate you for your assistance.
{{3952276-0-8914:}}Obviously. Though I hoped it would go better.\n\nI was experimenting with the reflective Daedric magic in this region. I always loved mirrors. During my studies, I fractured my personality, freeing my emotions to run amok. I haven't felt right since.
{{3952276-0-8915:}}It is, and beyond lies your final trial to restore the Scholarium. Your proctor for this test shall be me. \n\nAs you may have already guessed, I am the last Luminary who might lend their power to the Scribing Altar.
{{3952276-0-8913:}}Recently the count's entourage was investigating the nearby devastation when twisted creatures attacked us. The count escaped, but his pet bear cub, Lord Svendalmor of the Burnt-Biscuits, who we just call Burnbiscuit, fled deeper into the region.
{{3952276-0-8910:}}That's complicated. The tribune was on her way to Feldagard Keep. Said she had to check on something there. But she specifically sent me to find you and deliver these orders.
{{3952276-0-8918:}}Existence is breaking down around us and you want a recapitulation? Fine. The Daedric Prince Ithelia has absorbed so much power that she's causing reality to fall apart! But you restored the relics and we crafted the Mirror of Truth. Remember now?
{{3952276-1-8847:}}Find Narsis and help him recover the Emblem from Wendir. Here, let me mark it on your map. The area is swarming with Wood Elves of the Recollection. My dear Narsis is brilliant but impulsive, and needs someone to protect him from his own enthusiasm.
{{3952276-1-8759:}}A valuable piece of Ayleid history. I made the mistake of … inviting … the Recollection to help me. They betrayed me. Can you help me recover my notes, see what the Elves are up to, and help find the Emblem? It will be worth your while.
{{3952276-1-8899:}}If I get what's coming to me, so be it. The price of being a thief. But we left that life years ago. The other Scarlets don't deserve to die.\n\nCan you help me gather the crew? Protect them from whoever's hunting us? I can pay you. Thief's honor!
{{3952276-1-8895:}}Join forces with like-minded adventurers and fight off any Mirrormoor incursions you encounter. It's dangerous, but the Legion pays well. Just remember to defeat the incursion leader and you'll repel the attack.\n\nCan we count on you?
{{3952276-1-8896:}}She's a Goblin researcher. Pim's taken special interest in the two tribes which have camps near our farm. She talks about Goblins like they're the best thing in all of West Weald!\n\nGo talk to Pim, I'm sure she'd pay you for your help.
{{3952276-1-8751:}}Well, no. You also need to cast a spell to release each relic's energy and send it flowing into the fabric of reality. Here's the spell scroll.\n\nAnd you'll need help, so I'll send one of us to each location to assist you.
{{3952276-1-8750:}}Apocrypha, like all Oblivion realms, is infinite. But we have the Skein of Secrets. I shall open a portal. Use the Skein once we cross into the realm and see if it can pinpoint Ithelia's location.
{{3952276-1-8756:}}Because I handle multiple matters for Count Calantius and my cohort should have been able to fend for itself. The estate's proximity to Skingrad makes it a tempting target for enemy forces.\n\nListen, help me find my legionaries and you'll be rewarded.
{{3952276-1-8905:}}Keshargo has his reasons, but look around. Xoryn did this. He should not have the knot's power.\n\nOur camp contains the null arca, a container to stabilize the knot. We must find it before Xoryn does and place it in the null arca. Can you help?
{{3952276-1-8780:}}Yes. One Mizzik Thunderboots. It seems he and my aunt are old friends and he insisted on helping execute her will. I've had my fill, but you're welcome to lend him a hand. In fact, I can offer you a tidy sum if you can help move things along.
{{3952276-1-8781:}}The tribune and I didn't see any signs of combat. Just an empty courtyard. She ordered me to do one more sweep of the area and then report back to Skingrad, but I hate the idea of leaving her here alone.\n\nWill you aid Tribune Alea in her search?
{{3952276-1-8782:}}I'd almost describe them as beautiful if they didn't just try to eat me. The baroness helped evacuate as many merchants and civilians as she could, but there are still others trapped with those beasts.\n\nShe's promised gold in exchange for aid.
{{3952276-0-8753:}}We want to be married. And our fathers, trees take them, won't hear of it. You just saw the backside of an argument we've had many times. This was the last. Clen and I are going to leave, start a new life. \n\nCan … can I ask a favor? I have coin.
{{3952276-1-8904:}}Marcien knows their way around the woods, but it can be a dangerous place.\n\nYou've done so much, but I have one last request. Please find out what happened to Marcien. I'll pay you for your help. Their camp is just north of us, you can start there.
{{3952276-1-8908:}}Neletai would know. Nothing escapes her notice. \n\nIf you think you can help us, please find her. She's wealthy and doesn't care for mortal currency, so I know she'd make it worth your while. Please say you'll go.
{{3952276-0-8794:}}Are you familiar with the tharriker? It's a relatively recent addition to the Weald's wildlife. Not sure where it comes from, but it appeared shortly after the southwestern transformation.\n\nI need someone to find out more about these creatures.
{{3952276-0-8795:}}The Legion plans to renovate the ruins of Nonungalo and turn them into an armory. \n\nI need someone to enter the ruins and take note of any hostile creatures, hazards, or other dangers before we send laborers in there to begin the work.
{{3952276-0-8796:}}We learned about a strange Daedric creature our scouts called Stri the Fate-Eater making a lair in a cave far to the north of Skingrad. We sent a squad of legionaries to deal with the monster, but they never returned.
{{3952276-0-8797:}}Legion scouts spotted a group of Goblins setting up camp at Centurion's Rise to the northwest. If you can believe it, they think the foolish creatures are attempting to train dangerous tharrikers! \n\nI need someone to deal with this situation.
{{3952276-0-8790:}}A contingent of workers borrowed high-quality tools from the Legion storehouse for use at Haldain Lumber Camp. They were to be returned once the camp's supplies arrived, but we've had no word.\n\nI need someone to go and retrieve the tools.
{{3952276-0-8792:}}Root around in rubble and retrieve any Reachfolk trinkets you can find. It seems that during Varen Aquilarios's uprising to claim the Ruby Throne, Leovic requested aid from the Reachfolk. One such clan met its end at what is now called Varen's Watch.
{{3952276-0-8793:}}It's a delicate matter, I'm afraid. I was tasked with preparing invitations for Count Calantius's upcoming gala and the printer made a grievous mistake.\n\nWe must destroy those insidious invitations before anyone notices the calamitous error.
{{3952276-0-8798:}}I'm not sure if you're aware, but West Weald has been inundated with Daedra the likes of which we've never seen before. One such monstrosity is the crystalline entity we call Hessedaz the Baleful. I need someone to gather allies and deal with it.
{{3952276-0-8799:}}Have you heard of the Recollection? Some sort of cult or militant society? They're causing all sorts of problems in the Weald and we finally got a lead on some of their leaders, but I don't have any legionaries available at the moment.
{{3952276-0-8778:}}The Archmagister asked that I not say too much in earshot of my guildmates.\n\nLet's just say it's a magical anomaly. Untamed power from an unknown source. Plenty to catch a mage's interest, but that's just the trouble. It could be highly dangerous.
{{3952276-0-8773:}}These Goblins are more aggressive than usual. It's almost as if they're getting ready for war. When Goblins fight, they make trouble for everyone.\n\nGoblins aren't stupid though. They wouldn't get this aggressive without a cause.
{{3952276-0-8770:}}One masked brigand and the pack of horrid beasts she commanded! Fralgatha did everything she could to protect me, bless her heart, but the thief made off with my entire dowry. Now I haven't a napkin ring to present to my future bride.
{{3952276-0-8771:}}Bandits. Deserters from the war in Cyrodiil who united to pillage the countryside. They appeared in numbers too great for my small cohort of raw recruits to deal with.\n\nI could use someone competent and experienced to help me out.
{{3952276-1-8787:}}These crystaljacks have never been seen in the area and we have no idea how dangerous they truly are. Studying their venom can help us ascertain that.\n\nJust gather a few of the scattered crystals or take some from wasp corpses.
{{3952276-1-8789:}}Join forces with like-minded adventurers and fight off any Mirrormoor incursions you encounter. It's dangerous, but the Legion pays well. Just remember to defeat the incursion leader and you'll repel the attack.\n\nCan we count on you?
{{3952276-0-8747:}}I thought about finding Nantharion, but nothing happened. Then I remembered that these relics were made to find and defeat Ithelia. So I thought about her and these Daedric runes appeared. I think they translate as the Staff of Many Paths.
{{3952276-0-8758:}}Greenspeaker Sorilen sent me a letter. Asked me to meet her here. After I arrived, the ground rumbled like an angry timber mammoth. Whole buildings collapsed, trapping people.\n\nWhen the new forest appeared, it damaged the village. This may end it.
{{3952276-0-8759:}}Narsis Dren, explorer without peer, can always use capable assistants. For my present expedition, I seek an Ayleid treasure, the Emblem of the Last King, in the nearby ruins of Wendir, but the Wood Elves of the Recollection are damaging the site!
{{3952276-0-8750:}}You restored the original relics used to capture and imprison Ithelia. And we created the Mirror of Truth to try to show her the monster she has become. All we need to do now is travel to Apocrypha and locate her.
{{3952276-0-8751:}}Now, much of this is beyond me, but the Great Eye said you need to take the three relics that were used to defeat Ithelia and place them near tears in nexus points in the fabric of reality.\n\nThat should restore the frayed threads of fate.
{{3952276-0-8756:}}To protect the estate. I don't know if you're aware, but West Weald isn't the safest place these days. Between the new forest and the Wood Elf settlers to the west, and the rumors of cultists and Daedra stalking the land, I thought it prudent.
{{3952276-0-8757:}}I cannot discern its origin. Hermaeus Mora gifted me an ability to perceive the threads of fate. This tangle painfully overwhelms that very gift whenever I try to approach the inn.\n\nSomeone without such sight must act as my agent. Namely, you.
{{3952276-1-8797:}}Seems the Goblins have already trained two massive tharrikers, Fang and Talon, to guard the camp. They must be put down. Then destroy whatever supplies the Goblins are using to train the beasts.\n\nYou'll need help with this, so bring friends.
{{3952276-1-8796:}}We assume so. Take your most-trusted allies and search for a cave to the north. I want you to not only destroy this Daedric creature, but also to recover the Legion armaments from our fallen soldiers.\n\nCan I count on you, adventurer?
{{3952276-1-8795:}}Oh, just what one expects to find in Ayleid ruins. Spirits, ancient traps, natural hazards, structural instability. Those sorts of things.\n\nTake this journal and record your finding in it. Then return it to me when you're done. And do be careful.
{{3952276-1-8844:}}Just that Beragon and the tribune have been conferring with that strange High Elf, Leramil. Something about the Daedric incursions being a diversion to the real threat to reality. Whatever that means.\n\nWill you go talk to Beragon?
{{3952276-1-8762:}}In addition to defending the major roads to the north and east, its proximity to the devastated area and the new forest make it integral to the protection of the Weald heartland.\n\nWhat say you? Care to take a Legion commission and help me end this?
{{3952276-1-8763:}}Was. Past tense. But I'm not about to bandy my history with Balandrus, the so-called Terror of the Weald, to a stranger. If you want to tag along while I finish him, feel free.\n\nBut I'll pay you. I don't like to owe favors. Not if I can avoid it.
{{3952276-1-8761:}}Not exactly. I was hunting a violent vampire gang called the Terrors when I found an invitation to the auction. Inviting vampires to such an event is strange enough, but offering this Vesper Valente vintage? That has me concerned.\n\nWill you help me?
{{3952276-1-8766:}}A bit of brawn and a sharp blade would go a long way to saving those still trapped by rubble. As well as stopping the four Recollection rituals my guards spotted.\n\nHelp put a stop to this and I promise to make it worth your while.
{{3952276-1-8767:}}The fate of my vineyard rests on that stolen shipment of Blue Aedral. Recover the lost crates along with my dear Lazen and evidence of whoever is responsible for this attack, and I promise to make it worth your while.
{{3952276-1-8765:}}Raw deposits of Aetherial energy kept behind Ayleid security measures. Wouldn't be a problem except for Silorn's infestation.\n\nLook, I've got coin to spare. Any chance I could send you on in my stead? Otherwise I'm bone dust either way.
{{3952276-1-8769:}}Something killed the necromancers inside the ruins, but I believe they have risen from the grave to continue their dark ritual. These spirits are an affront to Arkay and we must exorcise them. I will reward you for your help in this.
{{3952276-0-8868:}}What other explanation is there? My father Ulbren was town constable. He wrote to me about investigating some suspicious deaths, then suddenly I get a letter telling me he had died.\n\nI requested leave from the Legion and returned as fast as I could.
{{3952276-0-8887:}}Leramil says it's time to once again take up the chase! She wants to resume the search for Ithelia and Torvesard.\n\nAs I understand it, every moment the Forgotten Prince remains free is another moment closer to the end of everything we know.
{{3952276-0-8882:}}The tears in the fabric of reality! I can't imagine what that exactly means or fathom all of the implications, but Leramil is convinced that sending Ithelia away only resolved the ongoing situation.
{{3952276-0-8888:}}The noted explorer Narsis Dren has gone to investigate the ruins of Wendir, and I fear he may be in trouble. He left some time ago to procure an Ayleid relic, the Emblem of the Last King. Could you go and help him? He will reward your efforts.
{{3952276-1-8746:}}When I think of Ayleids, I think of magic. Welkynd stones, portals, ancient relics. Things that would be dangerous in the wrong hands. But how it fits into Nantharion's plans, I don't know.\n\nThink you could help me piece it together, friend?
{{3952276-1-8790:}}We equipped the workers with packs of the best logging equipment in the Imperial stores. Retrieve any packs you find and bring them to me so I can catalog them and return them to inventory.\n\nThe Legion can't afford to lose such valuable tools.
{{3952276-0-8884:}}You passed some of my trusted associates when we entered Sunnamere. I want them tasked to investigate and catalog what we find. \n\nIn the meantime, you're our resident expert on Scribing. You need to learn everything you can.
{{3952276-1-8798:}}To the southeast, wandering along Fortune's Bluff. Oh, one more thing. Take these liminal soul gems. We had the Mages Guild place sentry spheres in the area to alert us to more Daedric incursions, but they need to be regularly recharged. Interested?
{{3952276-0-8905:}}Neletai recognized their leader as a Dremora called Xoryn. Apparently, his goal is the same as ours. Somewhere within the citadel is the arcane knot—a deeply unstable and mysterious object.
{{3952276-0-8904:}}Well, yes. Marcien's a dear friend. If they were going to be late they would've sent word. \n\nTheir trade takes them to many remote and isolated parts of the wilderness. If something happened to them, there wouldn't be anyone around to help.
{{3952276-0-8907:}}<I pulled this piece of Living Glass from Xoryn's armor. Strange lights seem to dance inside it. Keshargo will want to see this.>
{{3952276-0-8906:}}<I took this strangely glowing bottle from Xoryn's things. Keshargo will want to see this since it might have a connection to the arcane knot.>
{{3952276-0-8909:}}I was leading a patrol, hunting Daedra, when one of my own legionaries attacked me! An Orc named Ulrath. Such traitorous behavior endangered us all!\n\nSince I'm injured, could you locate whatever remains of my squadron? For mercenary pay, of course.
{{3952276-0-8908:}}It's an ancient Daedric fortress buried in the sands of Fargrave. \n\nWe thought we were the only ones there, but we were wrong. It all happened so quickly. I hope you can help them.
{{3952276-0-8844:}}That … I'm still not privy to. All I know is that the tribune wants you back at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad so you can listen to whatever the Wood Elf has to say.
{{3952276-0-8845:}}Not part of the Terror's gang? Good. Still, doesn't mean I want to show you my neck just yet. If you came to feed, you'll find slim pickings in Sutch. These vampires have already had their fill.\n\nThey're worse than when I ran with them. Much worse.
{{3952276-0-8846:}}Ostumir. It used to be lovely. Then that horrid jungle sprang out of nowhere and drove us out. We wanted to reclaim our homes, but I don't see that happening now. Not with so many dead.\n\nOh, I do hope that nice Wood Elf found more survivors.
{{3952276-0-8847:}}Narsis left some time ago to explore the ruins of Wendir. I fear he may be in trouble. He is trying to recover an Ayleid treasure, the Emblem of the Last King. Could you help him? He'll reward your efforts.
{{3952276-1-8800:}}That's terrible! Have you ever heard a dozen nobles scream and demand action? Or withered under the gaze of an angry count?\n\nTake some friends and deal with this threat. Then place these warning bulletins in the area until I can confirm it's safe.
{{3952276-1-8868:}}Not yet. First, I volunteered to replace him as constable. Then I had to make the arrangements to bury him. \n\nWith multiple deaths to investigate, I was hoping to hire a deputy. Would you be interested in the job, traveler?
{{3952276-0-8800:}}Ever visit Lake Olo to the east? It's a favorite relaxation spot for nobles and our wealthy citizens. Even Count Calantius is known to frequent the location.\n\nWell, an aggression of root called Oakenclaw has taken residence in the lake.
{{3952276-1-8841:}}And I'd share them with you if I could, but neither the tribune nor the Wood Elf deem it necessary to provide me with the full details.\n\nI was sent to deliver the message. It's up to you to heed the call. Once there, I'm sure they'll tell you more.
{{3952276-1-8846:}}Beragon. He came to Ostumir looking for his friend. Greenspeaker Sorilen, I believe he said her name was. After the disaster, he didn't hesitate to help.\n\nYou should join him. He's looking for survivors and could use a hand.
{{3952276-1-8845:}}Was. Past tense. But I'm not about to bandy my history with Balandrus, the so-called Terror of the Weald, to a stranger. If you want to tag along while I finish him, feel free.\n\nBut I'll pay you. I don't like to owe favors. Not if I can avoid it.
{{3952276-1-8909:}}When the Daedra ambushed us and Ulrath turned on me, I ordered the patrol to take shelter in Fort Hastrel, to the northwest. Any survivors should be there.\n\nI need to know what happened to Ulrath—and to my squad. Report back to me with any news.
{{3952276-1-8748:}}Ithelia said something about a loom and restoring what was lost. And her plan probably leads to the end of reality that Leramil keeps going on about.\n\nLet's take the fight to Ithelia and maybe prevent whatever she has in mind. Are you with me?
{{3952276-1-8749:}}I suggested we hide in the Ichor Sea until this blows over, but the Great Eye said no. So I need you and Leramil to accompany me to the instability.\n\nWill you serve as fate's chosen once more? I'll give you those pieces of gold you like so much.
{{3952276-1-8744:}}The lines of possibility that weave through reality and hold everything together. Ithelia, the Daedric Prince of Paths, has been set free. Her presence threatens both our world and the realms beyond. Help me meet this threat and you will be rewarded.
{{3952276-1-8745:}}Bosmer who honor the Green wouldn't have anything to do with a wildburn seed, but I want to show the seed we recovered to a greenspeaker. If they can tell us more about it, it might lead us right to the Recollection.\n\nHelp me and I'll pay your way.
{{3952276-1-8747:}}Precisely! Nantharion used the staff to prepare the wildburn seed ritual before you stopped it. I think the Skein is showing me places where Nantharion is using the staff to plant more seeds. A lot more.\n\nSo, friend, want to help me stop Nantharion?
{{3952276-1-8887:}}She's at my townhouse in Skingrad. Get there as soon as you can, friend. I'll meet you there.
{{3952276-1-8882:}}Meaning that while no new tears are appearing in reality, the existing tears aren't going away—they're getting bigger! Like a ripped sail shredding in a strong wind.\n\nWill you go back to my townhouse in Skingrad and talk to Leramil?
{{3952276-1-8888:}}Find Narsis and help him recover the Emblem from Wendir. Here, let me mark it on your map. He had some Wood Elf allies, but I do not trust them. My dear Narsis is brilliant but impulsive, and needs someone to protect him from his own enthusiasm.
{{3952276-1-8793:}}The printer rearranged the words I provided. The finished document contains a terrible insult to both the count and Skingrad. I need someone to travel north to Fort Colovia and burn the crates containing the invitations before they get distributed.
{{3952276-1-8913:}}I promised the count that I would not return without his pet—Burnbiscuit's probably near where the entourage was attacked. Let me mark it on your map. We should start the search there. I'm sure the count will provide a reward for your help.
{{3952276-1-8792:}}Oh, I'm not. But Count Calantius is, and he tasked the Legion with recovering them for a Reach diplomat. Apparently these trinkets, that Varen's forces considered unimportant and tossed in rubble heaps, actually have some sort of sentimental value.
{{3952276-1-8918:}}You need to return to the Tree Elf's dwelling in … that mortal city …. Beragrad. In Skingon. Something like that.\n\nI hate your primitive yet unduly complex language, you know that?
{{3952276-1-8915:}}The Wing of the Crow. When we first met, I said that it was up to the Luminaries if you would be Ulfsild's inheritor.\n\nNow you face a test unlike any you have seen before. There is an echo of Ulfsild nearby. Listen to it, and then we fly.
{{3952276-1-8758:}}Apparently a few months back, what was once rolling hills and rich Colovian farmland was suddenly engulfed by this great forest.\n\nLook, help me rescue more Ostumir survivors, then we can find Sorilen. I can toss you some coin for your efforts.
{{3952276-1-8753:}}They don't see eye to eye on anything. It's like they want to grind each other into bonemeal. A long story. \n\nIf you're inclined, find my Agawen Ciiril and tell her we're leaving. We need supplies and she might be willing to help us.
{{3952276-1-8799:}}I received word that Recollection leaders are meeting far to the west of here, near the town of Sutch, in a place called Frontier's Cradle.\n\nI need a group of adventurers to dispatch these leaders and gather any information you can find there.
{{3952276-1-8794:}}Reports indicate sightings to the southwest, near Fyrelight Cave. I need someone to see if the tharriker are establishing dens. Then collect samples for our mages to study. Claws, fangs, feathers, and eggshells should suffice.\n\nInterested?
{{3952276-1-8757:}}Pass through this tangle and enter the inn. Find the source of this disturbance. Stop it however you can.\n\nI cannot assist you in this. You shall stand alone against a force that tangles fate and unravels reality. Succeed and you shall be rewarded.
{{3952276-1-8917:}}Tribune Alea ordered me to locate you and deliver this message. She wants you to meet her at a townhouse in Skingrad. Belongs to a Wood Elf named Beragon. Says the two of you need to talk to him about the troubles plaguing West Weald.\n\nThat's it.
{{3952276-1-8910:}}Certainly! Tribune Alea commands you to go to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and assist the amiable Wood Elf with his ongoing investigation of the Recollection.\n\nShe also wanted me to tell you that either she or Beragon would compensate you well.
{{8637315-38-1:}}XP and more
{{149328292-10-19075:}}My siblings in House Ravenwatch lovingly accuse me of being soft. They say we live in a rough world, full of threats and cruelty. I know this well.\n\nI only seek to provide a counterbalance to the darkness by displaying politeness whenever possible.
{{149328292-1-18654:}}Quick, chimera's gone. Can you get to a focal point?
{{149328292-1-18655:}}Oh, I see. The wisps bear grim tidings. A darkness stalks you, and no matter how far and how fast you run, it will overtake you. Better to face it.
{{149328292-1-18656:}}Kill the intruders!
{{149328292-1-18650:}}No matter where I go, something terrible seems to happen. I help as I can, of course, but it's never enough.\n\nThat's what draws me into fighting for the Pit Daemons. It's something I do well. Plus I can walk away when I want.
{{149328292-1-18651:}}The vineyards interest me. I would volunteer to help stomp grapes, but my focus must remain on supporting my team.\n\nPerhaps once I fight better, I can stomp grapes.
{{149328292-1-18652:}}A few roses would cheer me up right now. Especially the thorns.
{{149328292-1-18653:}}Heads up, we've got some orbs!
{{149328292-1-18387:}}Look for whatever anchors this breach!
{{149328292-1-18384:}}We must hold them here!
{{149328292-1-18385:}}Damn these Mirrormoor bastards!
{{149328292-1-18382:}}Look! Up there!
{{149328292-1-18383:}}It's another incursion!
{{149328292-1-18380:}}This place has an unsettling air.
{{149328292-1-18381:}}This place feels … wrong.
{{149328292-1-18388:}}Spread out and find the source of the breach!
{{149328292-1-18389:}}I'm a friend, remember?
{{149328292-0-18361:}}I left Morrowind with empty pockets and grand ambitions. Look around—you can see how far that took me.
{{149328292-0-18360:}}Grow, reach, entangle!
{{149328292-0-18363:}}I did not make these things you see—they were waiting in the wood when I found them. I merely set them free.
{{149328292-0-18362:}}Colovian horses are born swift and sturdy, friend. My own humble talents added little to the fine mounts before you.
{{149328292-0-18365:}}These are strange days. I heard a rumor about the Wood Elf king using dark magic to grow their new forest! Thank goodness someone put a stop to that.
{{149328292-0-18364:}}A fine day to you, traveler! Look around. I'm sure you'll find something you like!
{{149328292-0-18367:}}Good to see things get back to normal! All that's left of the Recollection and their Daedric friends are stragglers, or so I hear. How can I help you?
{{149328292-0-18366:}}I don't know how it happened, but I hear the Recollection is on the run. Someone finally cornered that turncoat king, Nantharion, and put him down. Good!
{{149328292-0-18369:}}Do you wonder at Tethi's nickname? She knows exactly where she is. But it is true she was not a very good archer when she was a cub.
{{149328292-0-18368:}}Kanashurr does not need your pity. He needs your coin. Spare some or leave him be!
{{149328292-2-19074:}}Arcane investigations happen more often in a library than in a haunted graveyard.\n\nFinding a severed tongue scarred with ancient runes can be exhilarating. But spending days hunched over dusty tomes to translate those runes? That's the real fun.
{{149328292-2-19075:}}Gwendis behaves just as any true sister—she teases me endlessly. She calls me bookworm due to my love of libraries and my passion for books. I haven't yet thought of a nickname for her. I really must do some research.\n\nAh, blast. I am a bookworm.
{{149328292-2-19076:}}In many ways, I'm quite fortunate. Despite the various trials and pains I've experienced, I managed to stumble into a life filled with purpose. Count Verandis gave me shelter and a family. And now I count you as an excellent friend. How lucky am I?
{{149328292-2-19077:}}The topic of a cure comes up often among our kind. I don't know if you've considered, but I have. Even researched the process, which seems very rare and difficult.\n\nIn the end, I decided against taking the cure. This is who I am and I accept that.
{{149328292-2-19072:}}Not much for the match wagers, myself. I prefer cards, stones, or chits, you know? I bet on myself.
{{149328292-2-19073:}}What else is there to do when you're not working at the quarry or ranch?
{{149328292-5-18615:}}That's it. Destroy them! End their tiny lives.
{{149328292-2-18326:}}Yes, the goods I sell have seen the inside of an adventurer's pack. But they still have that newly-forged smell to them.
{{149328292-2-18329:}}Look at the durability of my wares. This is material that can stand up to fighting hard and sleeping rough! It's not just armor, it's an investment!
{{149328292-2-18328:}}I am proud of my stock. Why hunt like a hoarvor through the litter of other shops? Come to me and I will provide you with all the finery your home deserves.
{{149328292-0-18565:}}Fate's minions fall easily enough.
{{149328292-0-18564:}}I relish a battle with fate's chosen!
{{149328292-0-18563:}}Pulling tentacles off Watchlings is fun.
{{149328292-0-18562:}}Witness the power of our Prince!
{{149328292-0-18561:}}I bet Mora never saw this fate!
{{149328292-0-18560:}}Apocrypha shall be ours!
{{149328292-2-17843:}}Another mercenary back from the field. Give me the news, soldier.
{{149328292-2-17845:}}Perhaps you've heard. Imperial City is engulfed in war and a good portion of the Imperial Legion is off, trying to keep it contained. So, I have been authorized to hire adventurers and mercenaries to deal with more local issues. Care to hear more?
{{149328292-18-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 19)
{{149328292-1-18921:}}Your resistance is impressive. But it will not save you.
{{149328292-4-18358:}}Let Mirrormoor reign again!
{{149328292-3-18486:}}Defend the citadel!
{{149328292-0-18158:}}What this place really needs is a good story. Granted, there are plenty of tales about the Legion, but not so many about the ordinary people of Colovia. Give me your name, traveler, and I'll make you a hero of the written page!
{{149328292-0-18152:}}Compared to the might of Hircine, the Divines are nothing but fairy tales for children. We Reachfolk know the truth—real gods demand sacrifice. That's why we abide by the Law of the Fair Hunt.
{{149328292-0-18154:}}Have you been to the temple of Julianos, traveler? It's a fascinating place! Oh, my tail twitches just thinking about it. A sacred site constructed for the worship of an intangible god of logic. How deliciously illogical!
{{149328292-0-17879:}}I saw something hop in this barrel! Take a look!
{{149328292-0-17872:}}Hmm. That's a strange looking thing.
{{149328292-0-17873:}}Someone help me!
{{149328292-0-17874:}}I'd be mulch if not for you. Y'ffre bless you!
{{149328292-0-17875:}}How dare you harm my children!
{{149328292-0-17876:}}I will avenge my children!
{{149328292-0-17877:}}Hey! What's that?
{{149328292-1-17853:}}Follow the sounds of fighting—you'll find an incursion soon enough.\n\nDefeat the Mirrormoor champion leading the attack, and you defeat its incursion. But first, you need to kill the Shardborn valkynazes protecting the champion. Good luck!
{{149328292-1-17852:}}An Imperial Legion feeds on paperwork, hero. We both know perfectly well that we need fighters like you out in the field, but I'm not authorized to hire any more adventurers today.\n\nTry again tomorrow.
{{149328292-1-17851:}}I'm pleased to see you, hero. The Daedra of Mirrormoor continue to attack West Weald. If you're willing to help out, I can promise you another battle. And another reward.
{{149328292-1-17854:}}Onsi be praised! You return on your feet, not on a stretcher. Tell me, adventurer, were you successful?
{{149328292-1-18497:}}This won't take long.
{{149328292-1-18492:}}Do my bidding!
{{149328292-1-18490:}}My army is unstoppable!
{{149328292-1-18491:}}None of you have any conversation skills.
{{149328292-1-18498:}}Do we even have a plan? One that will work?
{{149328292-1-18499:}}Look lively!
{{149328292-1-18501:}}Fresh blood to spill!
{{149328292-0-18156:}}Long live West Weald! Will our victories never cease? I suspect they'll have to at some point. Sooner or later, we're bound to run out of enemies to vanquish.
{{149328292-1-18519:}}The champion of Mirrormoor strides forth!
{{149328292-1-18518:}}Prepare to be destroyed, mortals!
{{149328292-1-18512:}}These ruins reek of death.
{{149328292-1-18511:}}Minotaurs make for formidable foes. I like that.
{{149328292-1-18510:}}I'm having no luck creating Goblin zombies. How about you?
{{149328292-1-18517:}}Now witness what our ritual has wrought!
{{149328292-1-18516:}}Skingrad was starting to look a little sparse. Good to see new residents putting the hustle back in our bustle.
{{149328292-0-18702:}}These creatures are so fascinating.
{{149328292-2-18497:}}Die by my hands!
{{149328292-3-18379:}}Spill blood for the lake!
{{149328292-3-18378:}}Plants in the lake. Protect!
{{149328292-18-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 19)
{{149328292-4-18597:}}Your friends will get you killed!
{{149328292-1-18759:}}Proxy, use Abolisher to seal the portal!
{{149328292-1-18758:}}Do you seek a Tribute battle? Stendarr willing, I may prove a worthy adversary.
{{149328292-1-18753:}}Remember to donate coins for the wounded.
{{149328292-1-18754:}}Follow my lead!
{{149328292-1-18757:}}I study true the Covenants, Akatosh, that I may one day ….\n\nHmm. How can I help you?
{{149328292-1-18756:}}I'd check that book again. I bet that's the key to this puzzle.
{{149328292-0-18248:}}Watch yourself out there. I remember hearing something about Daedra and cultists stirring up trouble, but I can't remember the details. Strange.
{{149328292-0-18249:}}The sort of things that just … fall off the back of a wagon might surprise you. Know what I mean?
{{149328292-0-18246:}}I heard adventurers caught the Wood Elf king plotting to smother West Weald in forest. Oh, I wish I'd been a part of all that!
{{149328292-0-18247:}}Someone finally dealt with the Recollection. King Nantharion's dead, or so I hear … and I missed it all! Well, how can I help you?
{{149328292-0-18245:}}You're lucky you caught me. I was thinking of closing up shop and trying my luck in the Gold Coast. What do you need?
{{149328292-0-18242:}}The officers are all on edge because they think they've forgotten something. I'm positive I have, too. I simply choose not to worry about such things.
{{149328292-0-18241:}}I found the perfect spot for a little nap when the officers aren't looking. Now, I just need someone to complete my duties while I sleep.
{{149328292-2-18598:}}Yes! They obey me!
{{149328292-2-18599:}}Fools! All of you!
{{149328292-2-18594:}}I deserve this, not you!
{{149328292-2-18596:}}No one will underestimate me.
{{149328292-2-18590:}}You are stronger. You can win!
{{149328292-2-18591:}}My employer claims her beloved and her best friend are trysting in that moldering hole in the earth. Yet my nose tells me a thrice-blasted troll frequents the area.\n\nPerhaps I should bring some of its dung to my employer as proof?
{{149328292-1-17967:}}At least all this lifting keeps me fit.
{{149328292-1-17966:}}The work never ends.
{{149328292-1-17965:}}A bad day fishing is never truly bad.
{{149328292-1-17963:}}Where does the count expect these newcomers to sleep?
{{149328292-1-17962:}}This one heard about a new forest and had to come see!
{{149328292-1-17961:}}So much fighting for Zayabazi. Reaper's March, Valenwood, the Imperial city. All for a soldier's dinner.
{{149328292-1-17960:}}This one can be quite stealthy when she puts her mind to it.
{{149328292-1-17969:}}Strike first, question later, I always say.
{{149328292-0-18738:}}Slay any who dare trespass here.
{{149328292-1-18272:}}Traveler, are you worried about the devastated region? I heard it's growing larger and will soon encompass Skingrad!
{{149328292-1-18273:}}Lack of punctuality, incompetency with their weapons, poor hygiene … these new Legion recruits have much to learn.
{{149328292-1-18270:}}Champion, we summon you!
{{149328292-1-18276:}}Skingrad is a lovely place, but I sometimes feel stifled within these walls. In the wilderness outside the city, I can truly be myself.
{{149328292-1-18277:}}Our victory is inevitable!
{{149328292-1-18274:}}My tongue thirsts for the sap of the Hist. There is nothing like it here.
{{149328292-1-18275:}}There is a difference between admiring the natural world and letting it run amok. It is a distinction the Wood Elves never properly learned.
{{149328292-1-18278:}}Flee, you mortal fools!
{{149328292-1-18279:}}Foolish mortals! This is but the start.
{{149328292-2-18419:}}The nobility is adamant that we have little to worry about. The growing tensions will ease at some point.\n\nAll the same, there is no harm in shoring up your stores of healing drafts and protections.
{{149328292-3-19119:}}Feel the currents of fate flow through you!
{{149328292-0-17935:}}Real soldiers know how to take a hit.
{{149328292-0-17934:}}The Divines look kindly upon a generous soul. Won't you spare just a little coin?
{{149328292-0-17937:}}The Legion will protect us.
{{149328292-0-17936:}}Where did I put my leeches?
{{149328292-0-17931:}}There's plenty of meat to be had in Dawnwood!
{{149328292-0-17930:}}I haven't had any success hunting today.
{{149328292-0-17933:}}Toss a coin to a hungry stranger!
{{149328292-0-17932:}}We need to be prepared, just in case.
{{149328292-0-17938:}}The gossip about angry Wood Elves can't be true.
{{149328292-0-19091:}}Impress your friends, scribe something new! Bring it with you to your next dungeon, or battleground, or whatever it is you do.
{{149328292-0-19095:}}Ancient, stinks like dusty tomes. The Scholarium is my favorite kind of work environment. \n\nWho knows what I'll find, and sell to you?
{{149328292-0-19098:}}You're the deputy that helped the constable, aren't you? Thanks for cleaning up Ontus, friend!\n\nI'd give you a discount, but times are tough all around. You understand, right?
{{149328292-1-18591:}}Word of advice, stranger. When you accept a job that requires you to watch a location for a while, make sure you bring provisions.\n\nNow, please remove yourself. You're distracting me from my work watching that cave.
{{149328292-1-18590:}}Do that again!
{{149328292-1-18597:}}Share this pain!
{{149328292-1-18596:}}Nothing can stop me!
{{149328292-1-18594:}}You will never defeat me!
{{149328292-1-18599:}}You can't even hurt the real me!
{{149328292-1-18598:}}These mirrors will be your doom.
{{149328292-1-18336:}}You need to be careful traveling in this area. There are some nasty customers around. Not you, of course. You're one of the nicer customers.
{{149328292-1-18335:}}Good to see you again! I think it's again. I am so bad with faces. Not a good trait for someone who depends on repeat business.\n\nEither way, let me help you.
{{149328292-1-18334:}}There are those who work in the sunshine and those who work best in the shadows. Myself, I prefer a little shade in which to conduct my industry.
{{149328292-1-18333:}}Count Calantius does not like us, but he recognizes we serve a vital purpose in society. So long as we don't get too successful, he keeps the guards away.
{{149328292-1-18332:}}When you go into combat, it is not just you that is in the fight. Your family, your teachers, your allies are all there, even if they are not present in the moment. You fight not only for yourself, but for them as well. Remember that.
{{149328292-1-18331:}}In the course of battle, it may be necessary to execute a strategic retreat. If you do so, flee as fast and as far as you can. You can do no further harm to your reputation, and if your pursuer catches you, you'll be beaten as well.
{{149328292-1-18330:}}Of all the places this one has been, Skingrad is the most appealing. Imperials are quite friendly when they aren't invading lands that do not belong to them.
{{149328292-1-18339:}}I really shouldn't leave my tools laying around. Watch your step.
{{149328292-3-18501:}}I bet you think you can fight.
{{149328292-1-17990:}}That hint of citrus, perfection!
{{149328292-0-19119:}}Let the threads of fate restore your strength.
{{149328292-2-18614:}}I'm going to enjoy this.
{{149328292-3-18596:}}You do not know what I am capable of.
{{149328292-3-18590:}}Do not lose hope.
{{149328292-1-18140:}}Not all Bretons are magical geniuses. I'm walking proof of that. I tried to tell the Legion, but they didn't buy it. Then they gave me robes, served me three meals a day, and I was saluted in the street.\n\nIt's a complicated situation.
{{149328292-1-18141:}}It's hard to know who your real friends are here. I grew up in Skingrad, and I'm still not used to the ambition and Imperial fervor. I take a more direct path, but Imperials are swayed by appearances. Don't forget that, traveler.
{{149328292-1-18144:}}Attempting to ingratiate myself to the local nobility is proving more difficult than I anticipated. I have tried plying them with wine and flattery to no avail. Perhaps I should sharpen my dueling skills. Bah, what am I thinking?!
{{149328292-1-18146:}}This is a dark day for the Wood Elves, but there is still much to celebrate. West Weald continues to stand strong, and a dangerous threat has been eliminated. It may even be worth a toast.
{{149328292-1-18147:}}I can't do another night in one of Skingrad's cells! They're so cold. My fragile constitution can't take it. Be a friend, and don't share my whereabouts with the Legion, please?
{{149328292-1-18149:}}It's best to avoid the wine, if you ask me. Colovians don't hold to the Green Pact, so you can't be sure how they brew their drinks. The trees have long memories, and the Ooze is always waiting.
{{149328292-0-18474:}}I told you to give up, but you persisted. Deal with the consequences.
{{149328292-0-18477:}}So sad that you won't see the arcane knot return to its true holder.
{{149328292-0-18471:}}Time to meet your end!
{{149328292-0-18470:}}Xoryn will get this sorted out. Ha!
{{149328292-0-18472:}}Your life ends here!
{{149328292-0-18479:}}A banner? Look, they're waving a banner in our faces!
{{149328292-0-18478:}}I gave you the chance to run away. That moment has long passed.
{{149328292-1-17884:}}Succumb to my illusions!
{{149328292-1-17885:}}My roots will destroy you!
{{149328292-1-17886:}}Fall before the Recollection!
{{149328292-1-17887:}}My death is just the beginning!
{{149328292-1-17881:}}I think my mother's calling me!
{{149328292-1-17883:}}Those fools in Skingrad will bow to the Recollection!
{{149328292-1-17888:}}Everything's all fuzzy ….
{{149328292-1-17889:}}Where … am I?
{{149328292-1-18427:}}Wake! Wake and defend!
{{149328292-1-18426:}}Just because we conquered simple townsfolk doesn't make us an army.
{{149328292-1-18425:}}Yes, the weather's a bit strange this season. Yes, my packs are watertight. Yes, I will sell them. Let's get to the part where you pick one.
{{149328292-1-18424:}}Blood tastes so much better when the source is scared witless.
{{149328292-1-18423:}}This season's my favorite. The air just makes moving the leathers so much easier and they take to shaping so nicely. Oh, and they don't dry out either. Supple and soft, the best combination for a good fit. \n\nTake a look. You'll see what I mean!
{{149328292-1-18422:}}Hey, I don't remember a jungle to the south the last time we were here. How did I miss it?
{{149328292-1-18421:}}I think I liked it better when we were just bandits.
{{149328292-1-18420:}}Once the army is ready, where should we go next? Skingrad? Kvatch?
{{149328292-1-18429:}}I heard there's a new Daedric Prince wandering around. Not some one I'd like to run afoul of. \n\nTake my advice and get stocked up while you can. The best warriors are prepared for anything.
{{149328292-1-18428:}}No matter who I sell to, it's all high-quality stock. Sure, I'll support my team, but that can't interfere with the reputation of my business.
{{149328292-3-18578:}}Stay away from me, monster!
{{149328292-0-18671:}}We're nearly done. The stockade looks stronger every day.
{{149328292-0-18670:}}We remember, we recall.
{{149328292-0-18610:}}Stop whatever it's doing to those mirrors!
{{149328292-0-18617:}}This is a fluke!
{{149328292-0-18616:}}End it! End them all! Annihilate them!
{{149328292-5-18655:}}Oh, that's unpleasant. My wisps see a storm, a battle, and darkness. Bad tidings all around. Step carefully, friend.
{{149328292-5-18596:}}I will be powerful!
{{149328292-5-18594:}}Get out of my way!
{{149328292-2-18758:}}A challenger. I pray to feel Mara's love, that it might carry me to victory.
{{149328292-2-18757:}}The truth is the wisdom is the law, oh father of equations.\n\nHave you come for truth, pilgrim?
{{149328292-2-18754:}}Watch your step!
{{149328292-1-18612:}}See, this is why I didn't bother to fight you.
{{149328292-1-18613:}}Did you miss how outclassed you are in size, weight, and combat skill? But by all means, wave your banner.
{{149328292-1-18618:}}Enjoying the fight? It looks like you're tiring.
{{149328292-1-18619:}}Feed the wasps, they said. They don't sting, they said. Liars.
{{149328292-0-18828:}}Your vision has faded. Find another focal point. Each will be in sight of a ward.
{{149328292-0-18688:}}Yes, sleek esraj, you will soon sing to Fahuren.
{{149328292-1-18672:}}We should rebuild Hoperoot.
{{149328292-1-18673:}}I'm proud to be a part of the Recollection.
{{149328292-1-18670:}}When do we launch the attack?
{{149328292-1-18671:}}Have faith. King Nantharion knows what he's doing.
{{149328292-1-18076:}}Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh. Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh.
{{149328292-1-18070:}}Is that your protection? It's bad. Very bad. Azimurr doubts it can withstand the claws and fangs of West Weald's beasts. But you came for Azimurr's armor. This is good. Very good.
{{149328292-1-18071:}}I love selling swords because they bring in my sharpest customers. People who want mauls are too blunt and staff buyers are so wooden.\n\nI joke! All my patrons are lovely.
{{149328292-1-18072:}}Not enough time! Much healing to do today.
{{149328292-1-18073:}}Skingrad has so many threats right now. An overly aggressive forest, strange new animals, and Daedra everywhere you look. Don't know about you, but I want my possessions safe in times like these.
{{149328292-1-18079:}}There really is a forest where the rolling hills and vineyards used to be. It's amazing! And sort of scary. Where did it come from, I wonder.
{{149328292-2-18070:}}Let Azimurr take a good look at you. Hmm, this one sees the problem. Come. Take a look at the sturdy armor Azimurr has to offer. And it's reasonably priced.
{{149328292-2-17851:}}If you're looking for more work, Onsi knows I have plenty to share. The West Weald Legion is trying to keep up, but we're outnumbered. Perhaps even overmatched.
{{149328292-2-17852:}}I wish I could send you straight out to deal with another Mirromoor incursion, but I can't offer you more work right now. Check back soon, though—I have a feeling the Daedra aren't done with us yet.
{{149328292-0-18321:}}Behold, my traveler! You have stumbled upon the riches of the world, brought to you through great personal peril by the finest adventurers! How can we be of service?
{{149328292-0-18162:}}Everyone knows the servants hold the secrets of the city. If you ever need information, you'd do worse than to ask a servant.
{{149328292-0-18160:}}Life is far too short to allow oneself to be overcome by every passing difficulty. When I find myself growing weary of the tasks my employers set for me, I simply remember that they will be dead one day.
{{149328292-0-18166:}}All is well again in West Weald. But this one cannot help but feel she missed something … well! It is no great matter.
{{149328292-0-18165:}}This one can't help but wonder what the Wood Elves are up to now that their king is dead. Her paws are not so silent as they once were, or she would go investigate herself.
{{149328292-0-18164:}}This one would give anything to know what the Wood Elves are saying about their king. Just the thought of it sets this one's whiskers twitching.
{{149328292-3-18473:}}You always want to leave the bodies to rot. Let's eat them this time!
{{149328292-2-18470:}}How long have I been doing this? Seems like forever.
{{149328292-1-18629:}}Is it bad that I'd rather not do business with the ranch hands or quarriers right now? That fatigue fever scares me witless!\n\nOh, but if you want to trade, I suppose you look healthy enough.
{{149328292-1-18628:}}I thought coming out here would expose me to adventure and more thrills than my stall in the marketplace.\n\nPlease, if you help me get rid of my stock I can go back to Fargrave!
{{149328292-0-18080:}}Skingrad's trading guilds just don't accept anyone, friend. You need to know someone who knows someone. Connections, you understand?\n\nIf you ever want an introduction, I am sure we can come to an arrangement.
{{149328292-0-18081:}}Simple laborers deserve respect, too. I may not be heading off to join the Legion anytime soon, but that doesn't mean I want to be snapped at for the smallest mistake.
{{149328292-0-18082:}}I have always believed that adopting the ways of other lands is not good for Redguards. But I must go where my people go if I am to safeguard our traditions.
{{149328292-0-18083:}}I admit I entertained some ugly suspicions about the people of Vashabar. I am … relieved … to hear that they, too, were deceived by their king.
{{149328292-0-18084:}}I feared that it was a mistake for my people to come here. But now that the Recollection has been exposed and defeated, I deem things are changing for the better.
{{149328292-0-18085:}}Like a lion that prowls one's camp at night before moving on, a great danger has passed us by. Something strange, unseen by all but a few. I have a feeling you perceive it too.
{{149328292-0-18087:}}I once downed an entire bottle of Skingrad muscat in one long draw. You're supposed to sip it, but I'm not much of a sipper.\n\nStuff had more kick than I expected. Bitter, too. Not what I expected from these Skingrad vineyards.
{{149328292-6-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 07)
{{149328292-0-18332:}}Once you've faced the perils of hand-to-hand combat and experienced the ultimate excitement of victory, you know there is no other path before you!
{{149328292-0-18333:}}Perhaps you need someone to lift a burden from you? Perhaps you need someone to remove something that makes you uncomfortable or wanted by the authorities. Perhaps that someone is me?
{{149328292-0-18331:}}On the valorous fields of battle, the best and brightest smash each other's faces with heavy implements. I, of course, recognize my own virtues, and prefer to remain on the sidelines.
{{149328292-0-18336:}}Rest your weary bones for a while. And while you are here, feel free to look through my wares.
{{149328292-0-18334:}}What some do not want, others desperately need. I am here to help smooth out such transactions. Come, visit my shop, and see what I can tempt you with.
{{149328292-0-18335:}}I have a wide variety of … hang on, what's the word? It's right on the tip of my tongue. Equipment! Yes, that's the word. By Trinimac!\n\nWhat were we talking about again?
{{149328292-0-18339:}}Keep an eye out for my chisel. I seem to have mislaid it. Hang on, there it is. That's fine, I can pick it up later.
{{149328292-0-19063:}}Huh. For the first time since my wife and I came to Ontus, I'm beginning to think we made the right decision. The constable and the new deputy are making a difference!
{{149328292-0-19065:}}My stomach hurts.
{{149328292-0-19064:}}I don't feel so well
{{149328292-0-19067:}}I was really breaking rocks, then I just got real tired.
{{149328292-0-19066:}}My head hurts.
{{149328292-0-19069:}}Zeht heard my prayers! My husband finally found work. Now that the constable's new deputy has helped bring some order back to Ontus, no less than three farms near town want to hire him.
{{149328292-0-19068:}}What's wrong with me?
{{149328292-14-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 15)
{{149328292-0-18743:}}Enemies are near, I can sense it.
{{149328292-0-18740:}}Our Prince wastes her gifts on mortals.
{{149328292-1-18544:}}More gold for me!
{{149328292-1-18546:}}Why don't we just smash the totems?
{{149328292-1-18547:}}Forget what you've heard! The Aldmeri Dominion is the future!
{{149328292-1-18540:}}Shor's bones, how do any of you stand this weather?
{{149328292-1-18541:}}Let the Legion come! Those milk drinkers will never retake this fortress!
{{149328292-1-18548:}}As a servant of Dibella, I embrace different parts of myself to help others. I can be a doting mother or a ravenous lover. I can be a stern friend or a passive listener. Each supplicant has different needs.
{{149328292-0-18153:}}Oh, traveler. Don't despair. Dibella cannot bless us all. Could we recognize true beauty if everyone was blessed this way? Even homely creatures like yourself have a place in Akatosh's plan.
{{149328292-0-18530:}}Keep watch. We don't want any Legion reinforcements sneaking up on us.
{{149328292-0-18531:}}Hey, was the forest to the south here the last time we passed this way?
{{149328292-0-18532:}}The Legion won't be happy with us, but who cares?
{{149328292-0-18533:}}I still hate attacking legionaries. We used to be one of them.
{{149328292-0-18534:}}I was hoping for more of a challenge, truth be told.
{{149328292-0-18535:}}Did you see the way those recruits ran? They'll let anyone in the Legion now.
{{149328292-0-18536:}}Anyone know anything about those Recollection fanatics?
{{149328292-0-18537:}}I need a new pair of boots. Any in the stores here?
{{149328292-0-18538:}}If we're deserters, why are we still part of an army?
{{149328292-0-18539:}}It's amazing how we were enemies in Cyrodiil and now we're boon companions.
{{149328292-0-18277:}}Suffer the fury of Mirrormoor!
{{149328292-0-18276:}}Many people fear wolves, but there is much we can learn from them. They are self-reliant, cunning, and swift. They don't fear the darkness.
{{149328292-0-18275:}}All this nonsense with the Wood Elves would never be permitted on Summerset. High Elves have always had more sense when it comes to the use of magic. I hope their whole forest burns down.
{{149328292-0-18274:}}My scales grow dry this far from the Black Marsh. Even the hardiest tree needs good soil.
{{149328292-0-18273:}}Ugh, the new Legion recruits are imbeciles. Even the God of Arms himself could not help them improve.
{{149328292-0-18272:}}Traveler, do you think the new forest will cover all of West Weald? That it will never stop growing?
{{149328292-0-18271:}}This realm awaits, champion of Mirrormoor!
{{149328292-0-18270:}}The circle is ready, champion!
{{149328292-0-18279:}}Mirrormoor stands against you!
{{149328292-0-18278:}}To the Champion!
{{149328292-3-18483:}}None will be spared from her hunger!
{{149328292-2-17874:}}By the Green, I thought I was done for. Thank you, friend.
{{149328292-0-18499:}}This'll be quick!
{{149328292-0-18498:}}Why is everything in the citadel either sharp or dark?
{{149328292-0-18491:}}At least the ground muffles the sound of your clattering footsteps.
{{149328292-0-18709:}}Boots that squeak can lead to death, no matter your occupation. If you're a hunter, a squeaky boot can alert your prey to your presence.\n\nAnd I've seen a tavern brawl lead to the death of someone who didn't take proper care of their footwear.
{{149328292-0-18708:}}I find being a mage much more rewarding than other work I've done. And I've done plenty of work. Life is so much easier with magic.
{{149328292-0-18707:}}The books in this Mages Guild need to be put in order. I offer to help, but they like them like this.\n\nMaybe I'll organize them while everyone else is sleeping.
{{149328292-0-18706:}}There must be a way to clear a path. Try looking around for a focal point.
{{149328292-0-18703:}}My creatures are beautiful … and deadly.
{{149328292-0-18701:}}Round up any survivors.
{{149328292-0-18700:}}The Recollection will succeed.
{{149328292-0-17889:}}I can't … move away .…
{{149328292-0-17888:}}Wh—what's happening?
{{149328292-0-17881:}}Well, you have fun with that!
{{149328292-0-17883:}}My illusions will engulf all of West Weald!
{{149328292-0-17885:}}Witness the power of the Recollection!
{{149328292-0-17884:}}See only what I want you to!
{{149328292-0-17887:}}The Recollection will remember!
{{149328292-0-17886:}}None can stand against my illusions.
{{149328292-1-18249:}}Hey there. I'm always buying, and I don't ask awkward questions. What do you say we do some business?
{{149328292-1-18248:}}What? Oh, sorry. I can't shake the feeling that I've forgotten something important. Well, no matter. How can I help you, traveler?
{{149328292-1-18241:}}I thought slacking off during drills would get me kicked out of the Legion. Turns out, that just bought me more training and one-on-one lessons.
{{149328292-1-18247:}}First, war breaks out to the east. Now we have fighting all over West Weald, and I'm stuck here, minding a shop. How boring!
{{149328292-1-18246:}}Have you heard? King Nantharion turned out to be a cultist! He fled Vashabar. Exciting times, friend. Now, what do you need?
{{149328292-1-18245:}}The right enchantment can make all the difference in a tough scrape. And believe me, I've seen a few!
{{149328292-0-17968:}}I'm so happy I could dance!
{{149328292-0-17969:}}The Divines will protect.
{{149328292-0-17966:}}My back is sore!
{{149328292-0-17967:}}Lift and carry, lift and carry ….
{{149328292-0-17964:}}That Medallus Valerius, such a noble soul! Always looking out for people like me.
{{149328292-0-17965:}}Through Zenithar's grace, I have caught the biggest fish!
{{149328292-0-17962:}}Wood Elves think they're tough, but this one can out-drink them all!
{{149328292-0-17963:}}So many people in town these days!
{{149328292-0-17960:}}Is there really honor among outlaws?
{{149328292-0-17961:}}This one could use new greaves. But the old ones might hold up for another season or two.
{{149328292-1-18708:}}Skingrad grows on you. Not enough for me to stick around if my work here goes, shall we say, badly?\n\nI'll miss the wine awfully if I have to leave, though.
{{149328292-1-18709:}}The merchants who brave the wilderness have my respect. They may traverse safer paths, but that doesn't wholly negate the dangers they face on a daily basis.
{{149328292-1-18702:}}This trading post is ours now.
{{149328292-1-18703:}}Hunt as you will, my creatures!
{{149328292-1-18700:}}The ritual must be completed.
{{149328292-1-18701:}}No one can defeat the Recollection!
{{149328292-1-18706:}}Do you see a focal point? I bet that's the key.
{{149328292-1-18707:}}Skingrad may not be the post I wanted, but I will research everything about this area before my next posting.\n\nToday I learned that the horseman statue is that of Rislav Larich, who helped keep this town independent from a theocratic hegemony.
{{149328292-4-18795:}}Let Mirrormoor reign again!
{{149328292-4-18796:}}Let Mirrormoor reign again!
{{149328292-0-18201:}}The power of the Green flows through me!
{{149328292-2-18651:}}With a team name like Fire Drake, you may expect us to breathe gouts of flame on you.\n\nI assure you that I have no such intention at the moment.
{{149328292-2-18650:}}If we ever face each other here, I hope we learn from each other. Knowledge gained while facing a Pit Daemon like me is knowledge you can use through life.
{{149328292-2-18655:}}I see. I see. Very well. The wisps see a golden path laid before you, and that you have the strength to walk it. I see good fortune ahead for you.
{{149328292-1-17989:}}Colovian bows are adequate, but Redguard crafting is superb.
{{149328292-1-17988:}}Anything happening at the Stonechip today?
{{149328292-1-17987:}}All we do is work and work.
{{149328292-1-17986:}}Crafting is a beautiful thing.
{{149328292-1-17981:}}Anyone see my Book of Circles?
{{149328292-1-17980:}}My master told me to be worthy of my weapon.
{{149328292-1-17983:}}So tired. I must have the fever.
{{149328292-0-18325:}}When you get to be my age, you know which tomatoes you can squeeze, and which ones you should just leave on the vine.
{{149328292-0-18324:}}I have a strange egg-mate in Abah's Landing. She sings loudly to no one in particular, but can never remember the words. Her mind hunts in strange marshes.
{{149328292-0-18320:}}My uncle set me up with this shop. I'll find no better teacher than experience, he told me. So here I am.
{{149328292-1-17938:}}I should remember to take some food to the grape stompers.
{{149328292-1-17930:}}I may need to range deeper into the new forest for game.
{{149328292-1-17931:}}All who come in peace are welcome in Vashabar!
{{149328292-1-17932:}}In Vashabar, we respect the Green Pact.
{{149328292-1-17933:}}Any gold to spare?
{{149328292-1-17934:}}For a few coins, you can buy the satisfaction of knowing you helped someone in need.
{{149328292-1-17935:}}Scars are just reminders of things that didn't kill you.
{{149328292-1-17936:}}Everyone expects a healer to be compassionate, even if we're not.
{{149328292-1-17937:}}The Legion could use more recruits.
{{149328292-3-18552:}}Mortals must learn to kneel.
{{149328292-8-19074:}}I'm fortunate. While I find the sun's gaze uncomfortable, exposure doesn't burn me like some with my condition. What do I feel? Hmm, how to describe?\n\nSunlight feels like someone rolling pine cones all over my skin without end.
{{149328292-1-18139:}}Does the status quo mean nothing anymore? At this rate, I might as well wear my shoes on my head and walk on my hands. By the egg, I can't take this!
{{149328292-1-18138:}}Nothing gets my heart pumping as much as watching legionaries in action. I may just have to pick up a sword and join them, although I usually prefer fighting with my fists.
{{149328292-1-18133:}}I'm supposed to be taking inventory. If my superiors catch me slacking off, they'll give me double drills when training picks up again.
{{149328292-1-18135:}}How does one get started as an adventurer, I wonder? I just need someone to trust me with some sacred duty or to present me with a epic quest. I would accept it in a heartbeat!
{{149328292-1-18134:}}Don't waste my time with your war stories, traveler. They're all the same. I'd rather drink skeever milk than listen to another one.
{{149328292-1-18137:}}Do not mind the Colovians, traveler. They care too much for names and titles, and not enough for sweet wine and idle moments basking in the sunshine.
{{149328292-3-17846:}}My day is done and so is yours, adventurer. Get some rest and we can find you more work on the morrow. Skingrad and the Legion can certainly use the help.
{{149328292-3-17844:}}If you encounter any problems as you go about this task, remember that the Legion may not be available to assist you. We're spread so thin across the region as it is.\n\nThat's why we hired you.
{{149328292-3-17845:}}West Weald has needs that the local Imperial Legion cohorts aren't quite equipped to deal with at the moment. I am authorized to pay very well for any services rendered. Would you be interested in such work?
{{149328292-3-17848:}}Return with news of success and I'll sing your praises to the Legion! Well, at the very least, my report will be filed correctly and my superiors will get multiple copies. \n\nBureaucracy is its own form of glory.
{{149328292-3-17849:}}Unlike my comrades, I don't care whether you're a trained warrior or a mercenary. If you know how to swing a sword and have allies you can count on, I'll gladly accept your assistance.
{{149328292-0-18428:}}I've got everything you need to make the other armies scream like hunted boars. \n\nWhat'll you be buying?
{{149328292-0-18429:}}The fighting always rages on. If you need anything to hold off those cultists or their Wood Elf leader, you can get those here too.
{{149328292-0-18426:}}A vampire army! Can I be a general?
{{149328292-0-18427:}}We are the lake.
{{149328292-0-18424:}}We should make the bloodfiends do guard duty.
{{149328292-0-18425:}}Folks around here whisper behind their closed doors, like we've never faced tense times before. \n\nBut you aren't here to listen to my ramblings. Your pack's a bit small, right? Some things never change.
{{149328292-0-18422:}}Balandrus's a genius, using the townsfolk against each other.
{{149328292-0-18423:}}I came here from Arenthia just a short time ago. Imagine my surprise when a whole lot of other wood elves settled here too! Obliterated my homesickness, I'll tell you that. \n\nNow, I haven't been here long, but my leather's the best in Skingrad.
{{149328292-0-18420:}}Do we really need all those bloodfiends?
{{149328292-0-18421:}}I'm glad we came back to Sutch. The locals just taste better here. Maybe it's the water.
{{149328292-15-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 16)
{{149328292-2-18552:}}These mortals do not deserve Mirrormoor's blessings.
{{149328292-3-17847:}}Oh good, you're back. I need a break from filing reports. Please tell me I have one less disaster to worry about.
{{149328292-0-18629:}}I have a few goods to trade. Nothing like what you can get in Skingrad, but I'll happily take anything extra you have off your hands.
{{149328292-0-18624:}}Everything is going according to plan.
{{149328292-0-18625:}}We must move faster. Overwhelm the mortals.
{{149328292-0-18626:}}Um … can you untie me, please?
{{149328292-0-18620:}}I understand stealing wine, but why are we trying to domesticate freakish wasps?
{{149328292-0-18621:}}That smell. That's crystaljack excrement, isn't it?
{{149328292-0-18622:}}I think I'm getting the hang of training these wasps!
{{149328292-0-18623:}}I'm not done with you.
{{149328292-0-18659:}}My echo will outlast me!
{{149328292-0-18654:}}Can you see a focal point?
{{149328292-0-18651:}}The others here offer tips on my technique despite fighting for different teams. I appreciate them.\n\nIf only my experience of the world outside this camp mirrored my experiences here.
{{149328292-0-18652:}}Hush now. Let's not talk too loudly. These grapes should be ready for the Lord of Revelry soon. Now we just need those … oh, you're not the person I was expecting. Forget I said anything.
{{149328292-1-18368:}}Do you think Kanashurr deserves his fate? Go ahead. Mock and belittle him. Everyone else does.
{{149328292-1-18369:}}Tethi grew up in Reaper's March. She has fought Wood Elves more than once. But those Elves never brought a whole new forest to a fight.
{{149328292-1-18360:}}We are everywhere!
{{149328292-1-18361:}}I suppose I'm a terrible disappointment to my ancestors. Well, they're not here but you are. What do you need?
{{149328292-1-18362:}}This is fine horse-country, friend. Anyone could do well dealing in mounts around here. Even me!
{{149328292-1-18363:}}Do not be too swift with the plane or the knife. What you cut away you can never put back.
{{149328292-1-18364:}}You picked an exciting time to visit Skingrad, stranger. Oh, they've got their troubles outside the city. But we've never been safer here.
{{149328292-1-18365:}}People worry about the Wood Elves. Turns out they're not our enemies—it was King Nantharion! King no longer, or so I hear. Now, how can I help you?
{{149328292-1-18366:}}What can I get you, friend? If you're arming yourself for some cultist-hunting, you're a bit late. People are saying that some hero killed their leader Nantharion.
{{149328292-1-18367:}}It's funny. That Recollection army and their Daedric allies are on the run. But no one seems to know why they were here, or how they were defeated.
{{149328292-1-18477:}}Nothing stands in my way now!
{{149328292-2-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 03)
{{149328292-2-18760:}}Yes, I can already feel the power of the well coursing through me! All will tremble!
{{149328292-0-18673:}}Always remember, never forget!
{{149328292-5-18609:}}Look at you. Standing there like you can stop me. I thought of everything!
{{149328292-1-19119:}}The currents of fate shall revitalize you.
{{149328292-7-19075:}}Even before my present condition, I rarely drank alcohol. But, I always kept a filled flask to offer people with useful information. Many investigations back then relied on a well-lubricated source letting slip a secret or two.
{{149328292-7-19074:}}Oh, have no fear! I never partake of unwilling blood donors! House Ravenwatch only ever uses paid and willing blood servants. We treat them very well, never drink to excess, and compensate them for their service.
{{149328292-6-18594:}}You will not hold me back!
{{149328292-6-18596:}}I will be fulfilled!
{{149328292-6-18597:}}I hope this hurts.
{{149328292-6-18598:}}These mirrors see everything!
{{149328292-6-18599:}}Look and panic!
{{149328292-0-18819:}}A kind face, at last. So very good to see you, my friend. Perhaps your presence will temper Shelaria's threats to kill me.\n\nYour wish to aid in this Draugrkin business is welcome. Shelaria is a competent warrior, but her injures are quite severe.
{{149328292-16-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 17)
{{149328292-2-18358:}}And forge a throne from the shards that survive.
{{149328292-2-18359:}}Danger! Protect us!
{{149328292-4-18598:}}You can't hide from the citadel!
{{149328292-4-18599:}}You're not seeing correctly!
{{149328292-0-18323:}}Oh, look. A customer. Just what I was waiting for. I was thinking about how I was bored out of my mind, and who should show up? You. Makes my day!
{{149328292-0-18138:}}Last week I saw a legionary cut down an attacking Daedra. It was incredible! I heard you couldn't kill Daedra, but it fell like a tree to a logger's axe!
{{149328292-0-18139:}}No, no, no. There cannot be a realm called Mirrormoor. It defies everything we know about the Daedra! Ugh, all this uncertainty is making my tail twitch.
{{149328292-0-18134:}}Sigh. Nothing ever happens around here. It's always the same story. Quash the rebellion. Stop the Daedra. Protect the count. It's mind-numbing.
{{149328292-0-18135:}}Legionaries tell the best stories! Blood, battle, beasts—it's thrilling! I'm no good in combat, but I'd love to see some action one day.
{{149328292-0-18137:}}Are you new here, traveler? This one can help. She finds the Colovians a bit particular, but complimenting their wine and buildings will have them purring and lapping the moon sugar out of your paws.
{{149328292-0-18133:}}All this fuss about Nantharion! He's dead, that's it. At least with everyone so distracted, drills are canceled for now.
{{149328292-1-18478:}}Oh, how you marvel. I'm flattered.
{{149328292-1-18479:}}Shh. Never interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake.
{{149328292-3-18523:}}I'm happy to be here, but the diet takes some adjustment. Not all these people are strict followers of the Green Pact, but many inherited the traditional cuisine.
{{149328292-1-18678:}}If you're considering becoming a priest of Julianos, be ready to argue every nuance of your attempts at logical discourse.\n\nAnd never take setbacks personally. Practice makes better. Not perfect.
{{149328292-1-18679:}}Just keep moving, we need to hold out a bit longer.
{{149328292-2-19050:}}I will not be defeated!
{{149328292-4-18655:}}Well, that's interesting. The wisps say your future is a muddle. Undetermined. Unresolved. That's odd, since they are usually so sure of themselves.
{{149328292-3-19045:}}I haven't found the knot. But stopping you will please Xoryn too.
{{149328292-3-19048:}}This will be your last fight.
{{149328292-3-19049:}}Pity. I thought you'd last longer.
{{149328292-0-18549:}}Keep searching! The Legion's gold must be here somewhere.
{{149328292-0-18548:}}Dibella sent me here to provide comfort and reprieve to the tired and the sick of Ontus. Unfortunately, none of my remedies have thus far helped against the fatigue fever.
{{149328292-0-18541:}}Mead. Just a barrel. Maybe three. Is that too much to ask?
{{149328292-0-18540:}}I wish we had some rabbit meatballs.
{{149328292-0-18543:}}How many more Goblins are there?
{{149328292-0-18545:}}Jerntann doesn't care how we kill them.
{{149328292-0-18544:}}I could use a break.
{{149328292-0-18547:}}The Aldmeri Dominion is the only just cause in Tamriel!
{{149328292-0-18546:}}I'll kill all of them!
{{149328292-12-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 13)
{{149328292-2-18546:}}There better be a tavern around here.
{{149328292-2-18544:}}Nearly slipped on a rock.
{{149328292-4-18686:}}I live by that old saying: idle gold doesn't do anyone any good.\n\nPut yours to work with some scripts or grimoires!
{{149328292-1-19068:}}This is the fever, I just know it.
{{149328292-1-19069:}}I hear the threat of fatigue fever is finally over. Even so, I think I'll continue to avoid crowds for now.
{{149328292-1-19064:}}I'm tired.
{{149328292-1-19065:}}I hope this isn't the fever.
{{149328292-1-19066:}}Got to keep digging ….
{{149328292-1-19067:}}I felt great, got so much done. Now I feel like horse dung.
{{149328292-1-19063:}}For months, I've been telling my wife everything will be all right. I'll find work, our neighbors will warm up to us, someone will address the violence in town. Never imagined it would actually turn out that way!
{{149328292-3-18488:}}Stop the mortals!
{{149328292-5-19075:}}Rivenspire is a … fine place to live. It's the seat of House Ravenwatch, so I shouldn't criticize it. But, by the stars is it dreary! Maybe I can eventually convince the others to at least buy a summer home. Even Skyrim would be better.
{{149328292-5-19074:}}While I still have duties to House Ravenwatch, I'd love to experience more of Tamriel. I want to study ancient Argonian rituals in Black Marsh, and I long to see the haunted Dunmeri mushroom forests.\n\nWherever something's uncanny, I want to go there.
{{149328292-3-18482:}}Psh. I'll show you the error of your overconfidence.
{{149328292-0-18101:}}Mud, muck, and filth of all kinds! It never ends! Travelers are disgusting.
{{149328292-0-18105:}}I despise Colovian wine. It's too sweet and it makes my scales itch. It's disgusting.
{{149328292-3-18481:}}Mortals always fight battles they can't win.
{{149328292-0-18104:}}I quit my job at the quarry. Decided my time was better spent here with my bees.
{{149328292-0-18107:}}Vyla uxun, vyla vesek. Vyla uxun, vyla vesek.
{{149328292-3-18480:}}No one survives us!
{{149328292-2-17883:}}The Weald will succumb to my illusions!
{{149328292-2-17881:}}Be right back. Need to water my fish!
{{149328292-2-18684:}}I hope to find a good wine in Skingrad to pair with my new Wood Elf pork recipe. Trouble is that I got distracted by the once-plentiful boars here.\n\nMaybe Biryth was right and I need to cut back on my boar hunting. But they taste so good!
{{149328292-2-18685:}}On my way here, I ran into some folk muttering about outsiders. I can't decide if they were talking about me or someone else.\n\nWell, that's on them, not me. I like meeting folks who are new to me!
{{149328292-2-18686:}}As a veteran of the guild with a penchant for the identification and illumination of ancient secrets, a little advice. The cute little coffers carved with inscrutable runes? Never worth the next-day headaches.\n\nSorry. You came to shop. Take a look.
{{149328292-2-18680:}}If I can't find my friend soon, I'm going to get my coin back from the mage who enchanted this compass. Unless … hmm. Maybe people can change into wisps. I should ask about that first.\n\nBe careful, friend, just in case.
{{149328292-2-18682:}}Another traveler informed me that the Wood Elves may have something to do with this house's condition. That's for later consideration, though.\n\nRight now, I want to lean at the same angle as the house, which doesn't help my painting technique.
{{149328292-2-18683:}}Looks like I'll have to find a new favorite wine. Even the grapes that look safe in this vineyard could give a Peryite-blessed skeever the runs.\n\nDon't ask me how I know that.
{{149328292-2-18688:}}This one should give up banditry and become a musician.
{{149328292-2-18689:}}Where did you learn that foul language?\n\nOh, not you, stranger. My companion Seremina. We were just talking about what happens after I … no. Best not to discuss that with anyone.
{{149328292-3-17843:}}Ah, if only my old cohort were back from Cyrodiil. But at least you have returned. Were you able to accomplish the task I assigned to you?
{{149328292-4-18623:}}I'll defeat you myself.
{{149328292-0-17852:}}I can see you're ready for another round with Mirrormoor's forces. Unfortunately, I can't hire you on at this moment. Check back again later, hero.
{{149328292-0-17853:}}Onsi be praised! It shouldn't take you long to find an incursion.\n\nYou must defeat the Mirrormoor champion leading the attack to repel its incursion. But first, you must eliminate the Shardborn valkynazes who protect it. Good hunting, hero!
{{149328292-0-17850:}}Incredibly, I don't have any work at the moment. The calm before the storm, I suppose.
{{149328292-0-17851:}}Ah, you're back! The West Weald Legion could use your help again, adventurer. The battle against the Daedra invading our world does not go well.
{{149328292-0-17854:}}Ah, you return! Do you come bearing a report of victory, adventurer?
{{149328292-1-18214:}}For a moment, I thought we'd have a run on Wood Elf deposits in holding. But it looks like they won't be run out of the city.\n\nWhich is good! I don't want them to get run out.
{{149328292-1-18215:}}I can no longer accept coin that behaves strangely or comes from worlds outside our own. My apologies for the inconvenience. Happy to take a normal deposit, though.
{{149328292-1-18216:}}I like a sense of safety more than danger. People put gold in the bank when they feel safe and take it out when they're in danger. That makes safety better, in my opinion.
{{149328292-1-18210:}}Someone do something!
{{149328292-1-18211:}}You saved me! I'll never forget this.
{{149328292-1-18212:}}I thought that was the end of me!
{{149328292-1-18213:}}I died from exhaustion. And now I am eternally tired. So, you know, boo. Whatever.
{{149328292-8-18615:}}Little mortals, little lives!
{{149328292-0-18079:}}Are we at war with Vashabar? I've heard conflicting stories about the Wood Elves and I'm very confused.
{{149328292-0-18071:}}My customers always say that my wares have dual purposes. Get it? Weapons? Duel? Ha! I slay me! Get it? Slay? Anyway, have a look.
{{149328292-0-18070:}}What you're wearing now couldn't stop a branch in a windstorm. No, you need Azimurr's famous armor. Best quality in Skingrad. Stops all blows from snapping your bones. Azimurr guarantees it.
{{149328292-0-18073:}}Me? You trust me with your gold? Not that you shouldn't! It's just that some people think Orcs aren't good with numbers. I am though. Really good.\n\nUm, what can I help you with?
{{149328292-0-18072:}}The master mages need to stop dueling the adepts. It's not fair.
{{149328292-0-18076:}}Vyla uxun, vyla vesek. Vyla uxun, vyla vesek.
{{149328292-0-17957:}}Finding that thief is hopeless.
{{149328292-0-17956:}}I wish the count would let me design the Legion uniforms. I'm sure I could come up with something better than those gaudy crests.
{{149328292-0-17955:}}Curse the legion! Kick me out, called me a deserter. The fools!
{{149328292-0-17954:}}Each little grape holds an infinite number of possibilities. I love that about them.
{{149328292-0-17953:}}What are the ranchers up to this time?
{{149328292-0-17952:}}We are surrounded by reminders of the Ayleids. We built our empire on the bones of titans.
{{149328292-0-17951:}}Let's see. I have turnips for the salad. Need to find some carrots. And pears! That's what I forgot. Pears!
{{149328292-0-17950:}}My brother just joined the Legion.
{{149328292-0-17959:}}This one must tend to her duties.
{{149328292-0-17958:}}It takes many years to become a strong warrior.
{{149328292-0-18383:}}Above us! Look out!
{{149328292-0-18382:}}Something's coming!
{{149328292-0-18387:}}Search the area for the source of the breach.
{{149328292-0-18384:}}Be on your guard.
{{149328292-0-18921:}}I grow tired of waiting. I'll end this now.
{{149328292-0-18594:}}How dare you!
{{149328292-1-18535:}}Sure, I deserted. Who wouldn't? But if you say another word about the Covenant, you'll get my boot in your arse!
{{149328292-1-18534:}}I hope a real Legion cohort shows up. I could use a real challenge!
{{149328292-1-18537:}}Dark Company. Whoever came up with that name deserves an extra share of the next haul.
{{149328292-1-18536:}}What's next on our list? Maybe some raids into Hammerfell?
{{149328292-1-18531:}}Those recruits didn't stand a chance against experienced soldiers from Cyrodiil.
{{149328292-1-18530:}}I'd rather die for myself than for the Ebonheart Pact.
{{149328292-1-18533:}}I could go for some fried thunderbug legs right about now.
{{149328292-1-18532:}}Once we secure this fort, let's go after an estate or a vineyard!
{{149328292-1-18539:}}The soldiers here were like kittens without any claws.
{{149328292-1-18538:}}This one wishes this place didn't have so many vermin.
{{149328292-2-18245:}}Business is good here, but things are just a little too quiet for me. I'm ready for some real action! Now, how can I help you?
{{149328292-3-18618:}}I can see you trying to rally against them.
{{149328292-3-18616:}}Erase all evidence of their existence!
{{149328292-3-18617:}}I don't believe this.
{{149328292-3-18615:}}Stop fighting. You can't win!
{{149328292-3-18613:}}You're challenging them? Do you think that will make them kill you faster?
{{149328292-3-18610:}}Change the mirrors!
{{149328292-3-18611:}}This one thinks you can trick that creature.
{{149328292-1-18733:}}We may have to work with these mortals, but I don't have to like it.
{{149328292-1-18731:}}Prepare the weapons for the next arrivals.
{{149328292-1-18730:}}I want to crush the mortal city!
{{149328292-1-18737:}}Die well, mortal!
{{149328292-1-18736:}}Prepare to be destroyed!
{{149328292-1-18735:}}In a city filled with wine, those with heavy purses and profligate ways may find themselves stalked by those with light purses and lighter fingers.\n\nBear that in mind as you walk these streets.
{{149328292-1-18734:}}Khifeh finds joy in the learning of new things. Perhaps this one should become a scholar, yes? Leave behind the life of a Skingrad servant?\n\nYet this one is paid well for serving, and coin leads to comfort. Decisions are hard.
{{149328292-1-18739:}}The glory of Mirrormoor returns!
{{149328292-1-18738:}}Remain vigilant, Shardborn!
{{149328292-1-18085:}}Tall Papa warns us not to consort with Daedra lest they lure us away from our walkabouts. So whatever mischief the Recollection was involved in, it's good they were stopped.
{{149328292-1-18084:}}Lately I have heard tales about dark plots and great deeds in this land. I have a feeling you played no small part in these doings, stranger.
{{149328292-1-18087:}}I've run with some gutless petal-pickers in the past. You know where they are now? Begging for scraps in Riften. Or dead. Well, maybe one's arranging flowers for a soft Skingrad noble.\n\nPoint is that you gotta live life with your tusks bared.
{{149328292-1-18081:}}You spill one bottle of priceless Colovian wine, and you never live it down. My employer has been calling me Awkward Augun for weeks now.
{{149328292-1-18080:}}All these new faces in the city really should watch their coin purses more closely. Makes my tail twitch seeing so many unsuspecting newcomers. Out of concern, of course.
{{149328292-1-18083:}}I suspected the miracle of Dawnwood was too good to be true. To think that a Wood Elf king would unleash something like the Wildburn!
{{149328292-1-18082:}}Just as the wind makes a dune walk across the desert, troubles drive my people to strange lands. West Weald isn't what I would choose for children of Yokuda, but here we are.
{{149328292-0-18228:}}It's hard to sniff out intruders when that wine is making me hungry.
{{149328292-0-18222:}}That wine … the smell makes me so hungry.
{{149328292-0-18224:}}Keep those blood fiends in line!
{{149328292-0-18225:}}Are the servants still off limits?
{{149328292-0-18226:}}Getting all these covens and clans together, it's not natural.
{{149328292-2-18608:}}No! I surrender!
{{149328292-2-18609:}}You think you're so clever and powerful. Just wait.
{{149328292-2-18605:}}The exit is close. We can make it.
{{149328292-2-18606:}}Return to the null arca!
{{149328292-2-18600:}}Look to the crystals!
{{149328292-2-18601:}}Your friend is still alive.

{{149328292-1-17940:}}Always give your opponent a fighting chance.
{{149328292-1-17943:}}Work hard enough and you'll be rewarded.
{{149328292-1-17942:}}I could go for a glass of wine right now.
{{149328292-1-17945:}}I suppose you're right.
{{149328292-1-17944:}}My ancestors will be so pleased with these gifts.
{{149328292-1-17947:}}Boils are the mark of a true follower of the Blighted Lord! Come, share in the bounty!
{{149328292-1-17946:}}Who knew a Dunmer would find a place with the Bosmer?
{{149328292-1-17949:}}Lord Sanguine, hear my prayer.

{{149328292-0-18754:}}Lure them over here!
{{149328292-2-18597:}}I don't even have to aim!
{{149328292-0-18417:}}Bandits outside the city. Rumors of Daedra spotted near some ruin or another. Nothing changes. Not even my brews. Those only change when I run out of one. \n\nSo, drink up if you want something different.
{{149328292-0-18416:}}Almost a shame what we did to the town. Almost.
{{149328292-0-18415:}}Keep vigilant! Enemies are everywhere.
{{149328292-0-18414:}}How much did we pay for that so-called expert?
{{149328292-0-18413:}}We've been searching forever! Are we sure this is the right place?
{{149328292-0-18412:}}If I see that Dark Elf, I'm aiming straight for his eyes!
{{149328292-0-18411:}}Stay alert. The Terror expects company and he wants us to be ready.
{{149328292-0-18410:}}What are we trying to find again?
{{149328292-0-18419:}}It's glorious. Magnificent even. The explosion of magic from the Wood Elves had a profound impact on other forms of thaumaturgical manipulation. \n\nIn other words, it is an excellent time to invest in some magical wares.
{{149328292-0-18418:}}I want a name like the Terror. How about the Fang? Too literal?
{{149328292-2-18479:}}I heard about these banners. They're an insult! Do we not look challenging enough?
{{149328292-2-18478:}}You were in such a hurry to get here. Now you hesitate. Pitiful.
{{149328292-1-17964:}}When the mistress of the house says jump, I ask how high.
{{149328292-1-17968:}}I feel like singing!
{{149328292-0-18628:}}Ignore the chaos and injured. Let's have a bit of normalcy here, shall we?\n\nWhat are you looking to buy?
{{149328292-0-18627:}}I may be injured, but my shop is still open. Perhaps it will do you some good.
{{149328292-1-18828:}}Your vision has faded once more. Find another focal point. Peer through the lens and break the wards to find the key fragment.
{{149328292-1-18313:}}As my old magister used to say—I'd rather be drinking than thinking. At least I think that's what he said. He tended to mumble a lot.
{{149328292-1-18315:}}I work in the morning for a vintner, who gives me breakfast. I work for a merchant in the afternoon, who gives me lunch. I work for a tavern-owner in the evening, who provides dinner. Three squares, and three salaries! I do all right.
{{149328292-1-18314:}}The count's a greedy bastard.
{{149328292-1-18317:}}We build our business on trust. Trust and the thickness of our vault walls, of course.
{{149328292-1-18319:}}This is the finest Inn in all Skingrad! This structure has stood for a thousand years. With luck and hard work, it will stand for a thousand more!
{{149328292-1-18318:}}Feel free to browse. I'll try to stay out of your way. You look like someone who knows what they want.
{{149328292-2-18319:}}Count Calantius is the one of the craftiest leaders in the Empire. He keeps the streets swept, the wars far from our walls, and the coffers full of coin!
{{149328292-1-18605:}}Keep your hope!
{{149328292-1-18604:}}That creature looks powerful.
{{149328292-1-18609:}}Such tiny creatures. I cannot wait until they crush you.
{{149328292-1-18608:}}Please spare me!
{{149328292-2-18363:}}I see you're interested in my work. Each piece I shape upon the lathe shapes me in turn. The things we make, make us as well.
{{149328292-2-18362:}}We cannot teach horses to run faster or farther. But take good care of them, and they figure it out on their own.
{{149328292-2-18361:}}Draughts? Philters? Lockpicks? The coin you spend today is just a small investment to secure the trove you'll find tomorrow!
{{149328292-2-18360:}}Split at the stem.
{{149328292-2-18364:}}Welcome, traveler! I bet you've got an interesting story or two … but I can see you're here to shop. How can I help you?
{{149328292-1-18162:}}Servants glean a lot of information, you know. We're always there—sweeping the floors, serving the food—while the Colovian elites conduct their business.
{{149328292-1-18160:}}Others may not understand it, but I find immense satisfaction in the service of others. There is a joy in a job well-done, even when the task is as menial as sweeping the floor. And I sleep better at night knowing the floor is clean.
{{149328292-1-18166:}}Ah, sweet wine and celebration. There is little else this one would ask for, except a story, perhaps? She thinks she is forgetting an enemy that worked with the Recollection.
{{149328292-1-18164:}}Is it true? There is a new Daedric Prince? How can that be? This one does not believe it!
{{149328292-1-18165:}}Daedric invaders and Wood Elf plots. It's enough to drive one wild with curiosity, and this Khajiit is no exception. It's an exciting time, no?
{{149328292-0-18497:}}To arms!
{{149328292-0-18492:}}Take them out!
{{149328292-0-18490:}}Minions! Tear them apart!
{{149328292-1-18401:}}These spirits cannot defy their fates.
{{149328292-1-18400:}}Wood Elves and Imperials …. \n\nIt's a surprise I haven't found a way to bottle all the trouble they're brewing.
{{149328292-1-18403:}}There has to something worthwhile here.
{{149328292-1-18402:}}I thought we dealt with these meddling necromancers?
{{149328292-1-18405:}}This business with the Recollection really angers people. If I see a Wood Elf brave enough to face the world right now, I make sure to fill their tankard up.
{{149328292-1-18404:}}These ancient Elves loved their stonework, eh?
{{149328292-1-18407:}}Narsis Dren? Never heard of him.
{{149328292-1-18406:}}The relic must be here somewhere.
{{149328292-1-18409:}}That Dark Elf was insufferable.
{{149328292-1-18408:}}That Wood Elf King is dead. We all die, there's nothing special about it. Still, I'll drink to a death. What about you?
{{149328292-2-18764:}}The mirrors are important!
{{149328292-2-17847:}}There you are, thank Julianos! I thought I might need to send a search party. The logistics of such an endeavor would have been difficult, to say the least.
{{149328292-0-18653:}}Orbs, watch out!
{{149328292-2-17872:}}Does that tree look right to you?
{{149328292-2-17873:}}Anyone! Please help! It's horrible!
{{149328292-2-17846:}}No more assignments are available, adventurer. Come back later. Some new threat or danger is sure to appear eventually. It always does.
{{149328292-2-17876:}}Not my children! You will suffer for this!
{{149328292-2-17875:}}Flee, fool, or behold my wrath!
{{149328292-9-18615:}}Defying me was your last mistake!
{{149328292-1-18649:}}Why battle for the Storm Lords? If you're shallow, I'd say because of our beautiful purple heraldry.\n\nBut I hope you're not shallow. Take up our mantle and fully experience the righteousness that comes with fighting for the right team.
{{149328292-1-18648:}}The Legion's no match for the Recollection!
{{149328292-1-18647:}}I don't like fighting under all this rock.
{{149328292-1-18646:}}Find the ward, dispel it!
{{149328292-1-18645:}}Those legionaries never had a chance.
{{149328292-1-18644:}}The ultimate test.
{{149328292-1-18643:}}Something around here has to dispel these orbs.
{{149328292-1-18642:}}Return, my twin!
{{149328292-2-17844:}}I remember when the Legion was beyond number, when we had no need of adventurers-for-hire. Alas, those days are gone.\n\nStill, I expect you to bear in mind that Skingrad and Count Calantius are funding your efforts. Conduct yourself accordingly.
{{149328292-1-18399:}}We can't survive much more of this!
{{149328292-1-18398:}}Listen. There are voices on the wind!
{{149328292-1-18391:}}When do we get to fight somebody?
{{149328292-1-18390:}}I better not catch anyone sneaking around down here.
{{149328292-1-18393:}}As hiding spots go, this place isn't half bad.
{{149328292-1-18392:}}When will we be ready to strike?
{{149328292-1-18395:}}Do you hear chanting?
{{149328292-1-18394:}}Where's that chanting coming from?
{{149328292-1-18397:}}A storm! Brace yourselves!
{{149328292-1-18396:}}Something's coming. Something bad.
{{149328292-0-18354:}}So Nantharion rests with the Ayleids, eh? Thought that would happen. Never trusted any of his lot when they came through here.\n\nNot sure I trust you either, but that's not important. What can I hide for you?
{{149328292-0-18355:}}I've heard about you. You're kind of a big deal. Took down Nantharion. Not that that is any skin off my nose, but I know you're a dangerous one. Still, I can deal with you.
{{149328292-0-18357:}}Vyla uxun, vyla vesek. Vyla uxun, vyla vesek.
{{149328292-0-18350:}}The news from Dawnwood troubles my mind. I hear Nantharion's plans were foiled, but plenty of Daedra still roam the area.\n\nA good thing I have plenty of stock on hand.
{{149328292-0-18351:}}Yes, life as a Wood Elf in Skingrad was difficult for a while. But my neighbors have known me for years. They believe I'm trustworthy, as is my merchandise.
{{149328292-0-18352:}}Perhaps you came to do some business. Or are you just a spy for Count Calantius? They're all around.\n\nI think that server next door is one of them. Too honest. You can't be that honest in a place like this.
{{149328292-0-18353:}}You don't look like one of Nantharion's people. They walk around trying not to look sneaky, but they stand out like a sore thumb.\n\nNot like you. When you're being sneaky, you look like you're being sneaky.
{{149328292-0-18358:}}We three, shrouded in glass, summon the forgotten realm.
{{149328292-0-18359:}}Pelt and hooves. Attack! Attack!
{{149328292-2-18738:}}The Prince must not be interrupted.
{{149328292-2-18739:}}We will never forget again!
{{149328292-2-18736:}}For Mirrormoor! For glory!
{{149328292-2-18737:}}For Mirrormoor! For our Prince!
{{149328292-0-18736:}}Foolish mortals!
{{149328292-0-18737:}}Despair, mortal! You face the Shardborn.
{{149328292-0-18734:}}This one watches the artisans and crafters of Skingrad most assiduously, yes. But Khifeh also listens, ears a-twitching, for useful knowledge.\n\nAnd all knowledge is useful, Khifeh believes.
{{149328292-0-18735:}}Never join the dance until you know the steps, stranger.\n\nNow, by Dibella's kiss, shift yourself out of my own little dance.
{{149328292-0-18732:}}Mortal weapons are so fragile.
{{149328292-0-18733:}}The glory of Mirrormoor returns!
{{149328292-0-18730:}}Mirrormoor rises, my kyn!
{{149328292-0-18731:}}We shall overrun this puny realm!
{{149328292-0-18739:}}The Loom will soon be ready!
{{149328292-3-18073:}}One of the local merchants sends a dog to bring in her deposits. Those transactions are my favorite.
{{149328292-0-18590:}}Keep going!
{{149328292-0-18591:}}Can't a fellow enjoy a nice view of a cave without being interrupted?
{{149328292-0-18596:}}You never stood a chance!
{{149328292-0-18597:}}Take this!
{{149328292-0-18598:}}Take a good long look!
{{149328292-0-18599:}}I'm better than you!
{{149328292-1-19095:}}You'd be amazed at the wonders I've found within these walls. One thing I've learned so far? Everything is connected to that altar. Everything.\n\nIncluding my wares.
{{149328292-1-19091:}}You know, I once acted as a Chronicler for Vanus Galerion himself! A very important service role at a limited-time event with incredibly prestigious patrons.\n\nNot important right now. How can I help you today?
{{149328292-1-19098:}}I'm so glad the threat of fatigue fever is behind us. Now we can get back to business!\n\nSo, what can I sell you today?
{{149328292-2-18504:}}There's no way this plan backfires. It's better than the last one.
{{149328292-2-18503:}}Our guards are useless!
{{149328292-2-18502:}}Keep up that yammering and I'll split you in two.
{{149328292-2-18501:}}Let's test your strength.
{{149328292-2-18500:}}I'm going to expire from boredom alone. How does anyone stand this?
{{149328292-2-18485:}}We haven't fought anyone in ages!
{{149328292-2-18480:}}We will feast on your pain!
{{149328292-2-18481:}}I won't waste my time on you.
{{149328292-3-18796:}}Let that which has been forgotten be remembered.
{{149328292-3-18795:}}Let that which has been forgotten be remembered.
{{149328292-3-18499:}}You should have stayed outside.
{{149328292-4-18474:}}You're surprisingly hard to kill, Keshargo. But I think I'll succeed this time.
{{149328292-3-18490:}}Care to join us?
{{149328292-1-18271:}}Champion, the path is prepared!
{{149328292-0-18149:}}Keep your wits about you in this city. Wood Elves aren't the only ones who are good at thieving. In fact, you may want to sew your pockets shut.
{{149328292-0-18144:}}Life here is so different from Summerset. There are opportunities to be found in Skingrad, but there is also strife. The people are restless and rash. It's something the High Elves of my homeland would never stoop to.
{{149328292-0-18147:}}Shh! Don't be suspicious. We're not doing anything illegal—at the moment, anyway—but the Legion knows my face and they're always looking for a reason to toss me in the stocks. My neck is still sore from last time.
{{149328292-0-18146:}}I'm not sure what to make of the news about Nantharion. He was undoubtedly a villain, but I concede that this is a difficult time for the Wood Elves. It's akin to the upheaval here in the Empire.
{{149328292-0-18141:}}What brings you here, traveler? Everyone comes here for something. Coin. Glory. Work. It's the main draw of Skingrad—there are opportunities everywhere. If you know where to look.
{{149328292-0-17867:}}Right behind you, friend.
{{149328292-0-19236:}}Ah, apologies. This one is fine.
{{149328292-1-18489:}}Rise now and accept my will!
{{149328292-1-18488:}}Your trespass ends here!
{{149328292-1-18481:}}You're far beneath me.
{{149328292-1-18480:}}And so it begins!
{{149328292-1-18483:}}I bring forth an unstoppable army!
{{149328292-1-18482:}}You mortals think you're so talented. Very well, I'll make sure to test you.
{{149328292-1-18485:}}This place makes me itch.
{{149328292-1-18487:}}I am basking. Do not interrupt.
{{149328292-1-18486:}}Keep them from the light!
{{149328292-2-18204:}}The finest wares in all Tamriel, collected here for your convenience and pleasure! Now a show of gratitude would be nice.
{{149328292-2-18205:}}Ah. You seem like the kind of warrior who appreciates perfection. Not everyone is worthy of my wares!
{{149328292-11-19075:}}House Ravenwatch remains unique among our kind, but vampires have a reputation for savagery for good reason. Now that I experience the crushing hunger, I understand. Slipping into evil isn't as unthinkable as before.\n\nI must never forget that.
{{149328292-2-18208:}}I come from a line of alchemists. We would never adulterate our work with fillers like chalk, mushroom dust, or day-old bread. Only the best produces the best!
{{149328292-0-18557:}}Was the titan really the first of us?
{{149328292-1-18564:}}Soon the shards of Mirrormoor will be everywhere!
{{149328292-1-18565:}}Avoid the Black Books. They aren't what they seem.
{{149328292-1-18562:}}Torvesard really is the best of us.
{{149328292-1-18563:}}Too many books fill this place.
{{149328292-1-18560:}}Look how the realm changes!
{{149328292-1-18561:}}Let no aid reach the Prince of Fate!
{{149328292-4-18609:}}Go back to your little camp. Fighting these two will just give you more dead to bury.
{{149328292-4-18606:}}The knot is unstable. Go!
{{149328292-4-18605:}}The large mirror. We are almost there!
{{149328292-3-18597:}}Die alone or together. Your choice!
{{149328292-0-18518:}}Now the champion comes!
{{149328292-0-18519:}}Miserable mortals. Your world ends in glass and fury.
{{149328292-0-18512:}}Minotaur guts on my fur, ugh!
{{149328292-0-18510:}}Silorn is quite impressive. Too bad it's full of beasts.
{{149328292-0-18511:}}Goblin blood! It gets on everything!
{{149328292-0-18516:}}A lot of Colovians are upset about Dawnwood. But I see the Wood Elves as a strong new ally for West Weald.
{{149328292-0-18517:}}Mirrormoor is upon you.
{{149328292-3-18599:}}Stop trying.
{{149328292-3-18598:}}I want to see this from all angles!
{{149328292-3-18627:}}Given what just happened, I thought I should offer some discounts on my goods. \n\nDon't believe me? You should have seen what I was charging before.
{{149328292-3-18623:}}I'll ensure your defeat!
{{149328292-3-18628:}}I didn't want to be here! I thought it would be a good opportunity for me, but it isn't at all. I nearly died!\n\nSorry. I need to calm down. Get what you need and give me some space. Please.
{{149328292-1-18764:}}Change the mirrors!

{{149328292-1-18766:}}Wipe out the Daedra before they break through!
{{149328292-1-18760:}}Behold! Not even the mighty minotaurs could stop me!
{{149328292-0-18251:}}Sounds like some adventurer finally put a stop to Nantharion and his Wildburn. No complaints here—mass destruction is bad for business.
{{149328292-0-18250:}}I deal with shady customers, but I have my limits. Now that Nantharion's exposed as a Recollection sympathizer, maybe things will feel safe for ordinary thieves again.
{{149328292-0-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 01)
{{149328292-0-18252:}}Watch your step out there. I hear there are some Recollection bandits still skulking around. And some Daedric knights, too. What brought them here, anyway?
{{149328292-0-18259:}}Vyla uxun, vyla vesek. Vyla uxun, vyla vesek.
{{149328292-2-19236:}}Mizzik needs to stop doing that.
{{149328292-4-19074:}}Even before my condition, vampirism fascinated me. The disease seemed to corrupt people spiritually as well as biologically. I felt sympathy for those transformed against their will.\n\nNow I understand that, for many, the corruption is a choice.
{{149328292-4-19075:}}I definitely see Kallin's usefulness as a blood source. All the members of House Ravenwatch treat him with the utmost respect and kindness. To claim that I haven't filled my flask from him would be a lie. But, yes, it's an very odd arrangement.
{{149328292-0-18202:}}Embrace the power of our ancestors!
{{149328292-0-18203:}}Leave the fallen legionaries as a warning to their comrades.
{{149328292-0-18200:}}This place could use more trees.
{{149328292-0-18206:}}By the Green, what's happening?
{{149328292-0-18207:}}By Y'ffre, they're everywhere!
{{149328292-5-18478:}}I should thank you for the opportunity to try out my masterpiece before I reveal it to the world. But I won't.
{{149328292-17-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 18)
{{149328292-0-18729:}}We don't need this mortal scum!
{{149328292-0-18728:}}I learned all about the process for making wine at each vineyard I know of. One thing the best vintners have in common is that they top up the barrels so that the wine doesn't go sour.
{{149328292-0-18727:}}I find it difficult to pick a favorite wine among those produced in Skingrad. Perhaps another round of tasting is in order.
{{149328292-1-18267:}}Irnak hizaal, sumi zagh! Irnak hizaal, sumi zagh!
{{149328292-1-18266:}}Irnak hizaal, sumi zagh! Irnak hizaal, sumi zagh!
{{149328292-1-18261:}}Fools! I am your end!
{{149328292-1-18260:}}Behold the power of Mirrormoor!
{{149328292-1-18262:}}You dare defy Mirrormoor?
{{149328292-1-18269:}}Champion of Mirrormoor, we summon you!
{{149328292-1-18268:}}Irnak hizaal, sumi zagh! Irnak hizaal, sumi zagh!
{{149328292-2-18427:}}Protect us!
{{149328292-2-18423:}}I wonder if I'll ever get a nickname. Like Quickawl, or Strongthread. Something that shows my mastery, you know?\n\nAnyway, what are you looking for?
{{149328292-2-18428:}}What do you need? I have it in stock. Don't believe me? Take a look for yourself, but I know I'm right.
{{149328292-2-18389:}}You're scared, but you don't have to attack!
{{149328292-2-18543:}}Goblins are a blight.
{{149328292-2-18547:}}Ready for exciting, fulfilling work? Join the Aldmeri Dominion!
{{149328292-2-18545:}}I thought this would be more interesting.
{{149328292-6-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 07)
{{149328292-0-18686:}}You come around the corner. You see old Firandil and you know. You just know I have something good for you today. \n\nLet's see if I'm right! Hah!
{{149328292-0-18687:}}The guards around here know their duties, but everyone's fallible. I caught a pickpocket just the other day.\n\nThat one won't be dipping their hands into pockets again for months!
{{149328292-0-18684:}}Don't mind me. I'm just reading this cookbook I found. It has a maple-glazed bacon recipe that I hope to try after I hunt down another of these boars around here.\n\nI'm salivating just thinking about it.
{{149328292-0-18680:}}This can't be right. Why is this annoying compass bringing me here? All I've seen so far is wisps. My friend is not dead. Did she get turned into a wisp?\n\nNo, surely not. I refuse to believe it.
{{149328292-0-18681:}}That did it!
{{149328292-0-18660:}}We may fall, but our power remains!
{{149328292-1-19107:}}I could teach you a thing or two.
{{149328292-2-19107:}}No sudden moves now.
{{149328292-1-17912:}}I hear there are Daedra roaming the wilds.
{{149328292-1-17913:}}I need a good wallow in the mud.
{{149328292-1-17910:}}Burn one and two more sprout!
{{149328292-1-17911:}}Bah, who needs schooling? Especially when I am plenty smart already!
{{149328292-1-17916:}}Soon, I'll have more than rags to wear. My husband is extremely wealthy. And very late.
{{149328292-1-17917:}}Maybe I should try the battlegrounds ….
{{149328292-1-17918:}}Is there supposed to be a forest southwest of the city?
{{149328292-1-17919:}}Colovians are stuck-up prigs.
{{149328292-4-18601:}}Work quickly and work together!
{{149328292-3-18477:}}Your death means less than my victory!
{{149328292-3-18474:}}Nothing stands in my way. Not this barrier and not you.
{{149328292-13-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 14)
{{149328292-9-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 10)
{{149328292-2-18334:}}Commerce such as mine relies on trust from both the sellers and the purchaser. Even here, honesty is the best policy.
{{149328292-2-18335:}}I have the perfect thing for you! I put it somewhere. I had it in my hand just moments ago. No, maybe I don't have it. But please, feel free to browse.
{{149328292-2-18330:}}Dazhiir offers solid merchandise at a fair price. Think of fair as if it is a carnival of value. Minus the clowns, of course.
{{149328292-2-18331:}}I once showed off my talents on the battlefield. After I healed up from that experience, I decided to become a merchant. I never regretted that decision.
{{149328292-2-18332:}}I have fought on the battlefields, and never did I live so much as when I risked death. I quake even at the memory of it!
{{149328292-2-18333:}}Think of us as Skingrad's lost and found. You find it, and we help you lose it again. Works out well for both of us, eh?
{{149328292-1-18153:}}Truly, Skingrad is a city of immigrants. Everyone is welcome here. Even those who have no skills and no apparent use. But I suppose even the dullest knife can still spread butter. Perhaps that is where your path lies, wayfarer.
{{149328292-1-18152:}}What is it? Do you wish to be blessed with Hircine's Gift? Bah, the Father of Manbeasts only bestows such a blessing on those who are worthy. Lycanthropy is not for the faint of heart.
{{149328292-1-18156:}}Raise a toast, traveler! All of Skingrad celebrates today. The Legion has conquered—or, no, that's not right. They vanquished—what was it again? It is becoming difficult to discern when one victory celebration ends and another begins.
{{149328292-1-18154:}}What brings you to Skingrad, traveler? I must document your journey for my studies! Did you come for work? To join the Legion? To taste the wine? Please, I can't stand the blank pages in my notes!
{{149328292-1-18158:}}The Imperials are strong soldiers, but they lack imagination. When their ranks break on the battlefield, they can't do a thing without a commander's orders. Say what you will about the Nords, but at least our fighters are independent.
{{149328292-0-18655:}}Ah is that so little ones? They say you will face great victories, but at the cost of your own death. Wait, deaths. Plural. That's … interesting.
{{149328292-0-18657:}}I fall, but my echo lingers!
{{149328292-0-18656:}}We've been discovered!
{{149328292-19-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 20)
{{149328292-0-18198:}}Aren't my beasts magnificent?
{{149328292-0-18199:}}Was someone feeding my welwa?
{{149328292-0-18196:}}We remember! We never forget!
{{149328292-0-18197:}}That was the Legion? They're not so tough.
{{149328292-0-18194:}}Have you been here long, traveler? My study of the elves has brought me far from the stronghold where I was raised. It may seem strange, but I feel more at home here than I ever did among my own people.
{{149328292-0-18195:}}Welcome, traveler. Fancy sharing a story? You look like you've got some good ones. The dust from the road sticks to you like musk on a boar.
{{149328292-0-18192:}}I came here to get away from the Legion, but these Wood Elves have their own way of dealing with outsiders. I don't understand it, and I don't want to. What kind of religion stops you from growing crops? Bah, it's nonsense.
{{149328292-0-18193:}}You know, Wood Elf beliefs aren't so different from those in the Empire, once you get past the Green Pact. They worship Mara here too, as I do, just in a different form. It's fascinating to compare my stories with theirs.
{{149328292-0-18190:}}I always loved woodland creatures. I once let a prairie dog nest inside my tunic for three days because it looked so comfortable. And by once, I mean last week.
{{149328292-0-18191:}}Everyone knows the best rotmeth takes time to brew. That's why it's so hard to experiment with new ingredients. One wrong choice could literally waste years of your life. But even so, scamp guts have real potential.
{{149328292-0-18650:}}I smoke a pipe in the same way that others meditate. It clears my mind so I can achieve perfect focus. That's why I always win at battle.
{{149328292-0-18448:}}The baron's a great man to work for.
{{149328292-0-18449:}}The sound these crystal wasps make! It's driving me up the wall!
{{149328292-0-18440:}}Quiet! Did you hear something?
{{149328292-0-18441:}}Back on guard duty, you shirkers!
{{149328292-0-18442:}}Who knew deserting would be so profitable?
{{149328292-0-18443:}}I'm hungry but I'm not sure about the food today.
{{149328292-0-18444:}}I hope I don't get fatigue fever.
{{149328292-0-18445:}}When did we go from ranch hands to enforcers?
{{149328292-0-18446:}}What's Cook been doing? His food tastes much better!
{{149328292-0-18447:}}Is it time for lunch yet?
{{149328292-1-17896:}}You never saw me, understand?
{{149328292-1-17895:}}Read this. Remember that. I have so many better things to do.
{{149328292-1-17894:}}What is going on over on Valenwood's borders? What does it mean?
{{149328292-1-17893:}}I'd almost forgotten what a clear mind felt like. Thank you.
{{149328292-1-17892:}}I thought we'd be under their spell forever! Thank you, friend!
{{149328292-1-17891:}}We're … free at last!
{{149328292-1-17890:}}The voices … are gone!
{{149328292-3-18589:}}Do not let it hit you!
{{149328292-0-17980:}}A sharpened sword cuts both ways.
{{149328292-0-17981:}}I need to find a better job.
{{149328292-0-17982:}}Seems like all I ever do is pack.
{{149328292-0-17983:}}Feel my head! Am I hot?
{{149328292-0-17984:}}I lost many friends to the fever.
{{149328292-0-17985:}}The afterlife has plenty of room for all. Point to my next target and I will send them there!
{{149328292-0-17986:}}You need to listen to your material.
{{149328292-0-17987:}}I hope I don't get the fever.
{{149328292-0-17988:}}A new constable? What happened to the old one?
{{149328292-0-17989:}}The people of Ontus need to learn more about hunting.
{{149328292-0-18606:}}Quickly now!
{{149328292-0-18604:}}It's not working. Get creative!
{{149328292-0-18605:}}We are close to the exit!
{{149328292-0-18602:}}Animating Crux split 1
{{149328292-0-18603:}}What is that thing?
{{149328292-0-18600:}}Break the crystals!
{{149328292-0-18601:}}The knot is less stable than I thought!
{{149328292-0-18608:}}No, I don't want to die!
{{149328292-0-18609:}}You really think you can win? You have no chance here.
{{149328292-4-18600:}}That barrier is powered by something.
{{149328292-1-18698:}}Mirrormoor's victory is assured.
{{149328292-1-18699:}}This mortal town is ours!
{{149328292-1-18690:}}I'm told this area contains spirits who kill those with evil intentions. But I believe killing someone who has evil intentions is also an act born of an evil intention. So should these spirits not kill themselves?\n\nThis question keeps me up at night.
{{149328292-1-18691:}}If you're going to stomp grapes, you need a song. A rousing song. A song that lets you scream your love for stomping these grapes into the best damned wine you'll ever drink.\n\nI haven't yet found my song, but with enough stomping, I will! I swear it.
{{149328292-1-18692:}}These loggers deserved worse.
{{149328292-1-18693:}}Nature will not be denied.
{{149328292-1-18694:}}Cut down a tree, we cut down a score of you.
{{149328292-1-18695:}}Let the animals and the forest have this place.
{{149328292-1-18696:}}The mortals are somewhat useful.
{{149328292-1-18697:}}This area will make a perfect camp for the legions of Mirrormoor.
{{149328292-1-18342:}}I went out to this Dawnwood and found it filled with Wood Elves! They're chasing away the locals! Count Calantius should do something about this!
{{149328292-1-18343:}}There's a whole new forest sprouting up near the Gold Road. And that means opportunities! I'm going to head out there and see what I kind of work I can find.
{{149328292-1-18340:}}Things are getting back to normal, but I still don't trust the Gold Road. I'm staying in Skingrad.
{{149328292-1-18341:}}Did you hear? The king of the Wood Elves is dead. But I understand the real power behind the throne in Dawnwood is a Daedric Prince!
{{149328292-1-18346:}}Pity about Nantharion, but at least he improved the neighborhood. Now if someone could only do something about all these Daedra running about!\n\nStill, I have some goods you might be interested in.
{{149328292-1-18344:}}What brings you to Vashabar? A bargain, I'll bet. Well, you have come to the right place. If this old Wood Elf doesn't have it, you probably don't need it!
{{149328292-1-18345:}}Maybe he was in the wrong, but King Nantharion gave us incredible opportunities—a new land and a new forest! Now, what can I get for you?
{{149328292-1-18348:}}Come, look at what I offer. I specialize in furnishings not only from the Highlands, but Valenwood as well. My people keep me well-supplied.
{{149328292-1-18349:}}All the sudden changes to Dawnwood interrupted my regular supplies. Fortunately, I've set aside a good amount of back stock.
{{149328292-2-18741:}}Our day of reckoning is at hand.
{{149328292-2-18740:}}Everything lost shall be restored!
{{149328292-2-18743:}}Any orders from the shardmarshal?
{{149328292-1-18626:}}Not to sound ungrateful, but can you please untie me?
{{149328292-1-18621:}}Someone grab that damn dog!
{{149328292-1-18620:}}So, can I open one of those bottles of wine now?
{{149328292-1-17867:}}You lead while I look around.
{{149328292-3-18503:}}You won't get the best of me!
{{149328292-7-18615:}}End them! I don't care how!
{{149328292-2-18603:}}You cannot let them succeed!
{{149328292-0-18116:}}It matters not where the Wood Elves' allegiance lies. I care only that my blade is sharp and sure, and my target is clear.
{{149328292-0-18117:}}The people of Skingrad think they're safe simply because the Recollection has been thwarted. They forget that there are always enemies—even within the walls of their city.
{{149328292-0-18114:}}It does my heart good to see all this chaos cleared up. In fact, I can't seem to remember what the fuss was about in the first place ….
{{149328292-0-18112:}}These times certainly are strange. I don't know what to make of that business with Nantharion, but it does my heart good to know the Wood Elves were never truly our enemies.
{{149328292-0-18113:}}One thing at a time, that's what my father always told me. Today, we are safe from the nefarious plot of the Recollection. That is no small thing!
{{149328292-0-18118:}}My mind is usually as sharp as my blades, but something doesn't feel right. It's as though my thoughts have been blunted. Am I losing my edge?
{{149328292-2-18457:}}We get rid of you and the evidence at the same time!
{{149328292-2-18456:}}Once you're dead, the elixir goes in the water!
{{149328292-1-18452:}}The boss told us to be ready for a fight.
{{149328292-1-18453:}}Wood Elves and Reachfolk are both quite skilled in the healing arts. Imagine what we could learn from each other!
{{149328292-1-18450:}}The next crystaljack that stings me gets a sword up its arse!
{{149328292-1-18451:}}I've never worked on a ranch quite like this before.
{{149328292-1-18456:}}First you, then this whole damn town!
{{149328292-1-18457:}}Finally. I haven't hurt anything all day.
{{149328292-1-18454:}}Serving as one of Ard Caddach's few ambassadors is a true honor. He leapt at the chance to send someone to this fledgling kingdom. I was fortunate to win the post.
{{149328292-1-18455:}}You need a dose of my wonderful elixir!
{{149328292-3-19095:}}Chroniclers in the Mages Guild have a policy of neutrality. I'll happily sell to anyone, as long as the price is right.
{{149328292-3-19091:}}The key when shopping is never to have your heart set on just one thing. I offer so many treasures, so many secrets. \n\nI mean how can you choose just one? Take a look.
{{149328292-1-18222:}}We better get our share from this auction.
{{149328292-1-18470:}}Can't wait to get back to the mortal realm for more bloodshed.
{{149328292-1-18471:}}Death comes for you!
{{149328292-1-18472:}}It's slaughtering time!
{{149328292-1-18473:}}They cannot hear you. That doesn't mean you cannot kill them.
{{149328292-1-18474:}}The knot belongs to me. You can't have it.
{{149328292-1-18475:}}Oh, how you marvel. I'm flattered.
{{149328292-1-18476:}}Well done. We killed them.
{{149328292-1-18610:}}The mirrors are the source!
{{149328292-1-18611:}}Lead it to an orb!
{{149328292-1-18614:}}Your fate is sealed.
{{149328292-1-18615:}}Don't toy with them! Kill the mortals!
{{149328292-1-18616:}}It is time! Destroy them!
{{149328292-1-18617:}}That was a lucky hit. Nothing more.
{{149328292-0-18093:}}My wife isn't sure we should have come to Ontus. I tell her everything will be all right—the work is plentiful, the streets are safe, and the Colovians are friendly. None of it's true, but it makes her feel better.
{{149328292-0-18092:}}There is always work for those with sharp knives and silent steps. I have both, and Ontus has a plethora of disgruntled residents. If you practice the same trade I do, move on. This is my town.
{{149328292-0-18096:}}The Legion let me come home to help my family after my mother died from the fever. I hear the new constable is a legionary, too.
{{149328292-0-18095:}}There is room for all in service to the Prince of Trickery and Bargains! My master handsomely rewards those who obey his commandments. Abandon your foolish quests, and join with the illustrious Clavicus Vile.
{{149328292-0-18094:}}I wish my husband believed in himself more. I'm sure he could find work if he was just a little more confident. I'll pray to Zeht to make the farms here flourish. Then, there will be plenty of work.
{{149328292-2-18073:}}I may seem young, but I'm good with numbers and handling gold. Nothing's ever gone missing from my coffers. I swear by Mauloch!
{{149328292-2-18071:}}Trust me, my weapon prices are a steal. Get it? Because they're made of steel! Hmm, except the items that aren't. This joke may need some work.
{{149328292-0-18327:}}My travels show me wonders all over Tamriel. But, I feel no greater thrill than finding things a good home.
{{149328292-0-18326:}}It's a fine day for shopping, and you won't find a better selection in Skingrad. Just move aside the stuff you don't like.
{{149328292-0-18322:}}This one knows you can deal with other merchants! Charlatans! Thieves! No, only by dealing with this humble one can you truly find what you are after!
{{149328292-0-18329:}}The key to durable clothing is thread-count. Look at this weave. Look at the fibers we use. You could never count so many threads.
{{149328292-0-18328:}}You want to buy something. I can see it in your eyes. The way you cast them upon my wares. You are one who does not know what you want, but you know you want it.
{{149328292-0-19054:}}Go gently, visitor—this is a difficult time for Vashabar. Half the elves here are appalled at how easily King Nantharion fooled them. And the other half are hoping it all turns out to be a misunderstanding.
{{149328292-0-19055:}}You picked an interesting time to visit, traveler. A new Bosmer cultural tradition is taking shape here—the Dawnway. It is a great time to be a scholar! Although the King Nantharion scandal muddies the waters a bit.
{{149328292-0-19056:}}I like to think I can smell trouble before I see it, but this business with King Nantharion and the Recollection at Hoperoot caught me completely off-guard. It makes me wonder what else I've missed around here.
{{149328292-0-19057:}}King Nantharion fooled me twice. First he hid his dealings with the Recollection. Then he returned to Vashabar with a small army of Daedra after I thought he was gone for good.\n\nBut I guess he won't get a third chance, will he?
{{149328292-0-19050:}}Die quickly or suffer!
{{149328292-0-19051:}}It's impossible. West Weald is full of Ayleid ruins for me to study, but the Recollection hovers around them like senche-tigers guarding a kill! What was King Nantharion thinking, involving himself with those fanatics?
{{149328292-0-19052:}}To think that long-lost Miscarcand was right under my feet this whole time! No wonder Nantharion chose this site for our town. If only he hadn't taken up with those cultists and Daedra!
{{149328292-0-19053:}}I don't know what to think about King Nantharion and the Recollection. It's beyond me. The forest and the little creatures are the only complexities I need in my life.
{{149328292-0-19058:}}It's good to see Vashabar back on its feet. When Nantharion and his Daedric friends seized the old ruins here, I thought the town was finished. But the wind's blowing in a new direction now.
{{149328292-1-18557:}}Follow our orders to the letter!
{{149328292-1-18556:}}These ruins. I remember the mortals who lived here. What happened to them?
{{149328292-1-18555:}}Why do we even bother with mortals?
{{149328292-1-18554:}}We must guard the ancient one!
{{149328292-1-18553:}}Put these foolish mortals in their place.
{{149328292-1-18552:}}This realm will be ours!
{{149328292-1-18559:}}No one must approach the ancient one.
{{149328292-1-18558:}}Keep watch for fate's lackeys.

{{149328292-7-19095:}}Scripts and grimoires. I have them, and you can too, if the price is right. Care to take a look?
{{149328292-0-18523:}}Hello there! Are you a citizen of Vashabar? No? That's fine, I'm still happy to meet anyone passing through this area.
{{149328292-0-18522:}}Bathe this world in prismatic glory!
{{149328292-0-18521:}}Remake this realm in glass!
{{149328292-0-18520:}}Let the shards of Mirrormoor consume all!
{{149328292-0-18527:}}Fighting for ourselves is better than dying over in Cyrodiil.
{{149328292-0-18526:}}They certainly eased up on the qualifications for joining the Legion since I was a recruit.
{{149328292-0-18529:}}We're all deserters! What of it?
{{149328292-0-18528:}}Did you see how fast those legionaries ran when they saw us?
{{149328292-1-19046:}}I can't believe it. King Nantharion, in league with the Recollection? What else have I missed while I've been rummaging through the roots for skulls and such?
{{149328292-1-19047:}}I actually admired Nantharion. He said we didn't have to let a king in Elden Root tell us how to live. Yet all he wanted was a throne of his own.\n\nI'm a fool for listening to him.
{{149328292-1-19044:}}Vashabar seemed like a nice quiet place to drop out of sight for a time. I never imagined the ex-king and his Recollection fanatics planned to upend it all with Ayleid magic!\n\nGood thing they're dead.
{{149328292-1-19045:}}Don't worry about getting out of the sunken ruins, you won't be leaving.
{{149328292-1-19043:}}Quite a few Wood Elves in Vashabar are very unhappy with Nantharion and his supporters today. There are scores to settle. A promising development for someone in my line of work.
{{149328292-1-19048:}}Let's see how long you last.
{{149328292-1-19049:}}You never stood a chance.
{{149328292-1-18795:}}From our three fonts we remake this world.
{{149328292-1-18794:}}Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh. Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh.

{{149328292-1-18228:}}Anyone have any extra arrows?
{{149328292-2-18589:}}Get ready!
{{149328292-1-18184:}}Careful. You never know what's buried in these old ruins.
{{149328292-1-18186:}}My mind drifts like a leaf on the breeze sometimes. I can't help it, leaves are so pretty when they get blown around! Why would I want to be stuck on a branch? Surely it's better to follow the wind!\n\nThere I go again. What were you saying?
{{149328292-1-18187:}}An assassin can find work anywhere, if they're clever. Even smaller settlements like this have their tensions. Just need to find the thread and pull on it until it closes around someone's neck.
{{149328292-1-18180:}}I once honed my ax so fine, I sliced a man's hand off and he didn't even notice. It's true! That's what good blade maintenance will get you.
{{149328292-1-18181:}}It's easy to find jobs here. Finding anyone who pays enough, that's the hard part.
{{149328292-1-18182:}}Criminals like us aren't so hard to get along with. We've got our own rules and traditions here. Just keep moving, carry a sharp blade, and always sleep with your back to the wall.
{{149328292-1-18183:}}I don't understand why this place is important.
{{149328292-1-18188:}}Every bone is its own work of art. I'm especially fond of the hands. So many interconnected pieces make up the fingers alone! Just think what would happen if one tiny section was out of place. Well, you'd have a broken hand, for starters.
{{149328292-1-18189:}}Our work is more vital now than ever. Dawnwood's growth has covered archaeological sites in the area. We have to document every detail before the ruins are completely buried beneath the Green.
{{149328292-1-18040:}}Stay alert, my friend.
{{149328292-1-18234:}}Can you imagine? Eat wine sodden mortals and become more powerful!
{{149328292-1-18232:}}Careful! You're as clumsy as a blood fiend!
{{149328292-1-18233:}}I'm so hungry!
{{149328292-1-18230:}}So far, Valente's a better boss than Bogvir ever was.
{{149328292-1-18231:}}Lot of powerful vampires attending the auction.
{{149328292-0-17971:}}I'm not a criminal!
{{149328292-0-17970:}}I must speak with Count Calantius about the sorry state of the city's walls.
{{149328292-0-17973:}}Bears aren't scary. You know what's scary? Skeevers!
{{149328292-0-17972:}}This city is so confusing.
{{149328292-0-17975:}}Ah, the start of another fine day in Skingrad! I can't wait to get to work!
{{149328292-0-17974:}}Ach, my shoulder!
{{149328292-0-17977:}}Where did he go? We were in the middle of an argument.
{{149328292-0-17976:}}The longer you temper the steel, the stronger the sword will be.
{{149328292-0-17979:}}Blast it! The fencing for the new vineyards didn't arrive. We can break up some old barrels, but that's just a half-measure.
{{149328292-0-17978:}}What's with all the adventurers?
{{149328292-0-18638:}}You! You are just another riddle to be solved!
{{149328292-0-18633:}}Sic 'em!
{{149328292-1-18676:}}King Nantharion is a great leader!
{{149328292-1-18677:}}Ah, you represent the break I needed from pondering thought. Focusing too long provides diminishing returns.\n\nIndeed, a fellow priest of Julianos spilled tea on me yesterday, which helped me reach an important conclusion on the role of mistakes.
{{149328292-1-18674:}}What are we looking for here again? A stein?
{{149328292-1-18675:}}Look what our ancestors created here!
{{149328292-1-18714:}}You get to see it all in my line of work. The richest of the rich and the poorest of the poor. Knaves and nobles bump shoulders while the tavern wench watches. Sometimes she sees too much. That's when It's time to move on.
{{149328292-2-18627:}}I think the Khajiit knew that we'd experience some trouble here. He told me to stock up before we left Fargrave.\n\nSee for yourself.
{{149328292-2-18624:}}We're certain to make this battle a short one.
{{149328292-2-18625:}}I thought these legionaries would be more trouble.
{{149328292-2-18623:}}I will destroy you this time!
{{149328292-2-18628:}}This isn't the expedition Keshargo promised. He never said we'd be attacked. \n\nAre you here to help us? Please, buy whatever you need!
{{149328292-0-18204:}}Don't handle the merchandise unless you plan to buy it. I don't want to have to check your pockets.
{{149328292-0-18205:}}I can see that you know your steel, traveler. You'll find no better blades west of Windhelm.
{{149328292-0-18208:}}The key to perfect alchemy is perfect ingredients. Only by sourcing the best and freshest materials can I produce the finest potions, poultices, and poisons.
{{149328292-0-18209:}}Help me! Please!
{{149328292-1-17929:}}I hear the Colovians plan to drive us out.
{{149328292-1-17928:}}Baan Dar's playing tricks on me again. I can't seem to win a Tribute match here.
{{149328292-1-17923:}}Arguments among the clan are the worst.
{{149328292-1-17922:}}Y'ffre smiles on those who share their bounty, traveler.
{{149328292-1-17921:}}Is the devastated area spreading?
{{149328292-1-17920:}}Let's toast a hard day's work!
{{149328292-1-17927:}}Can't the Mages Guild do something about the Daedra?
{{149328292-1-17926:}}Maybe I'll go back to the vineyard for a bit. The wine here is watered down with tears.
{{149328292-1-17925:}}The greenspeakers are investigating the devastated area.
{{149328292-1-17924:}}I hear a spinner has a new tale to tell us!
{{149328292-14-19075:}}Alchemy is my first love and my constant passion. The anticipation for an unknown reaction is unlike any other. If you haven't tried the art, I highly recommend it. Many find the experience intoxicating. And sometimes you can drink the results!
{{149328292-3-18476:}}We agreed that I was going to choose what happened to these ones.
{{149328292-3-18475:}}Take your time. I'm just considering where to mount you.

{{149328292-1-18104:}}Quarrying was all right, but I prefer collecting honey over stacking and chipping rock.
{{149328292-1-18105:}}Why do the quarriers and the ranch hands not get along? Just because the bosses are in competition, doesn't mean they have to be, too.
{{149328292-1-18106:}}A glass of wine a day keeps the fever away.
{{149328292-1-18107:}}Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh. Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh.
{{149328292-1-18101:}}Maybe if those stinking travelers actually had to clean up their own messes, they would stop tracking filth through my freshly cleaned town!
{{149328292-1-18102:}}All my life, I've loved fish. Not fishing—the creatures themselves. Oh, not to eat! They're so agile in the water, easily navigating the currents and waves. If only our lives were as simple as theirs.
{{149328292-3-17850:}}Your dedication is admirable, adventurer, but I must focus on bureaucratic matters for now. Never fear. I'm sure I'll have work for you again soon.
{{149328292-2-18183:}}Check over there.
{{149328292-2-18184:}}Ugh, I hate wasps.
{{149328292-0-18431:}}Uprisings and cults pop up all the time. Don't lose sight of the battles which really matter. Or on the upkeep of your gear, which matters even more.
{{149328292-0-18430:}}I'm glad all that nonsense with the Recollection is over. Means there's more time to focus on winning the next fight!
{{149328292-0-18433:}}I got into this profession to make coin fast. So why do good flavors take so long to develop? \n\nIt still tastes good. Salt solves everything.
{{149328292-0-18432:}}Psh. Newcomers! So stingy with their purses. I'd much rather see our long-absent legionaries return. At least they send some coin home from their military pay.
{{149328292-0-18435:}}This pays better than the Legion ever did.
{{149328292-0-18437:}}I saw a quarrier carry a stone bigger than his head!
{{149328292-0-18436:}}Guarding a fussy noble is boring.
{{149328292-0-18439:}}I like being a mercenary. We're our own boss!
{{149328292-0-18438:}}Keep a look out for the constable and her deputy.
{{149328292-2-18454:}}I thought I'd miss the rocks and crags of the Reach, but the Dawnwood is growing on me. It's growing on everything for that matter.
{{149328292-2-18453:}}Thank you all for attending! I plan to offer an exchange of culinary culture soon. I have a hearty coney stew recipe.
{{149328292-1-18521:}}Purge this realm of mortal filth!
{{149328292-0-18639:}}The riddles call to me ….
{{149328292-0-18637:}}My head is spinning. So much to decipher, so much to unravel. Why?
{{149328292-0-18636:}}Find the Unseen! Don't stop searching.
{{149328292-0-18635:}}Hircine, take my soul ….
{{149328292-0-18634:}}Cut down any who dare breach these walls!

{{149328292-0-18631:}}Let no enemy pass!
{{149328292-0-18630:}}You were quite the challenge, little fawn.
{{149328292-0-18725:}}Dawnway this, Green that! Can't we just pick one already?
{{149328292-0-18724:}}These Ayleid ruins are significant.
{{149328292-0-18726:}}Why is making friends so difficult?
{{149328292-1-18379:}}We are many. We are powerful!

{{149328292-1-18370:}}Tethi thought for sure there would be war between Skingrad and Dawnwood. Now she hears that Nantharion was the true villain. A crooked tale indeed!
{{149328292-4-18473:}}Yes. You're right. They are quite a bit smaller this time around.
{{149328292-1-17850:}}Thank you for your service to the Legion. I have many reports to complete at the moment and I'm terribly behind on my paperwork. I'm sure I'll have a need of you again soon.

{{149328292-2-18491:}}I suppose I raised you for combat and not entertainment.

{{149328292-3-18317:}}I know where every item is in our vaults. I keep it all in my mind and can send a runner at once to fetch it. What I don't know is not worth knowing.
{{149328292-0-18475:}}I gave you the chance to run away. That moment has long passed.
{{149328292-0-18476:}}Is it over already?
{{149328292-0-18128:}}I have a nagging feeling I've forgotten something. Eh, it's probably the amount of wine I've had recently.
{{149328292-0-18124:}}My friend told me to meet him here, but I seem to have forgotten when we arranged to meet. Was it supposed to be yesterday, perhaps? Or maybe he simply hasn't arrived yet. I'm not sure. I'll just wait.
{{149328292-0-18473:}}Guests. Challengers. Corpses. Do we toy with them or kill them quickly?

{{149328292-5-18599:}}I am everywhere!
{{149328292-5-18598:}}Your reflection will hurt!

{{149328292-1-18663:}}If you aren't making full use of everything you trap, you need to do better.\n\nAt least make sure whatever's left over is available to vultures, ants, and other scavengers.
{{149328292-1-18667:}}Almost time to feed the tharrikers.
{{149328292-1-18666:}}I know this place is sacred, but it's also kind of creepy.

{{149328292-1-19078:}}Hello, I'm not available due to unforeseen circumstances. As I don't know the nature of the reasons for my absence, which will happen later, I cannot fully explain. I hope that makes sense. So, I apologize for my future disappearance in your present.
{{149328292-1-19077:}}No doubt you've heard stories about the origins of our condition. I wouldn't let them worry you overmuch. We cannot be held responsible for actions beyond our control. All that matters is how we behave in the here and the now.
{{149328292-1-19076:}}Adusa-daro expressed skepticism when she heard about our adventures. She seemed to think you did more of the work than I let on. Maybe we should carefully document my contributions the next time you and I go into the field. I always bring a notebook.
{{149328292-1-19075:}}I see Count Ravenwatch as more than a father figure. My birth father was quite cruel, whereas Verandis showed compassion from the moment he found me.\n\nHere's the truth. If not for him I may have descended to become a bloodfiend. How shameful of me.
{{149328292-1-19074:}}People often ask what formal training I needed to become an arcane investigator. I had none, aside from a brief alchemy apprenticeship. No, all one needs is immense curiosity and determination.\n\nOh, yes, and a wild disregard for personal safety.

{{149328292-0-17845:}}Count Calantius has authorized the Imperial Legion of West Weald to hire capable individuals to handle delicate situations throughout the region. Would you be interested perhaps?
{{149328292-0-17844:}}Everything is recorded and official. Now get to it. The sooner you complete the task, the sooner you get paid.
{{149328292-0-17847:}}Have you completed your task? I'm eager to get the report filed away.
{{149328292-0-17846:}}No more work available today. I must finish these reports for Count Calantius. Return tomorrow and I am sure to offer you something intriguing.
{{149328292-0-17843:}}That was fast. Report, mercenary!
{{149328292-0-17849:}}I have more problems than soldiers to handle them. Please tell me you're available to lend your strength to the Legion for a time.
{{149328292-0-17848:}}I appreciate your help. My superiors are pleased with my results lately, which would be a point of pride, if it didn't mean they keep giving me more to do.
{{149328292-1-17843:}}You return. Tell me, has the assignment been completed?
{{149328292-1-17844:}}The wilds of West Weald have become increasingly more dangerous. I assume by your dress and weaponry, you're no stranger to trouble. Still, it pays to be cautious.\n\nShould you survive and do well, I'm sure we can extend this arrangement.
{{149328292-1-17845:}}You have the look of someone who likes to get things done. Care to help out the Imperial Legion and earn some gold along the way?
{{149328292-2-17889:}}The song … so beautiful ….
{{149328292-2-17888:}}Such a captivating melody .…
{{149328292-2-17885:}}Feel the roots entangle you!
{{149328292-2-17884:}}Get lost in the illusions I spin!
{{149328292-1-18207:}}No! Stay away from me!
{{149328292-1-18206:}}No! They're everywhere!
{{149328292-1-18205:}}Any smith can sell you something sharp. But perfect balance? A grip that won't slip, an edge that won't dull? You need Dangurd.
{{149328292-1-18204:}}Let me guess—you're just looking today. Everyone's always just looking. Might be nice if someone surprised me by buying now instead of just looking.
{{149328292-1-18203:}}They think us small and weak, but we are strong!
{{149328292-1-18202:}}The Legion warriors were unimpressive.
{{149328292-1-18201:}}Those Daedra creatures are helpful, but they still scare me.
{{149328292-1-18200:}}We recall, we remember!
{{149328292-1-18209:}}No, stay back!
{{149328292-1-18208:}}Yes, you can make a bog-standard poison from off-the-shelf components. But a careful ingredient selection will make that concoction sing.
{{149328292-1-17957:}}Why does no one get out of the way?
{{149328292-1-17951:}}They are serving roasted steaks for dinner. I should really make sure we have enough red wine.
{{149328292-2-18796:}}And forge a throne from the shards that survive.
{{149328292-0-18044:}}Thank you, stranger. May the Divines bless you.
{{149328292-0-18040:}}The vampires are dangerous. We need to be on guard.
{{149328292-0-18041:}}Official business. Don't come any closer.
{{149328292-0-18042:}}I have suffered your interference long enough, outsider!
{{149328292-0-18043:}}Might not be a bloodsucker anymore, but I can still hunt with the best of them.
{{149328292-0-18677:}}Welcome, friend. Here in Skingrad, we revere the Divines, especially Julianos, who grants us all opportunities to hone our epistemological thinking.\n\nIf you need practice, I recommend reading Lectures on the Theory of Knowledge.
{{149328292-0-18676:}}We're so much better off than we were in Valenwood.
{{149328292-0-18675:}}I love exploring these old ruins.
{{149328292-0-18674:}}I can't wait until our forest covers the land!
{{149328292-0-18679:}}Fancy footwork, now. Don't get hit.
{{149328292-0-18678:}}Word choices matter. For example, think well upon whether you wish to categorize something as, say, a mineral. Do you know the definition of mineral? If not, then start there.
{{149328292-15-19075:}}I believe in balance. Perhaps that comes from my alchemical studies. As a vampire, I'll always tip in the direction of darkness. I have to accept that.\n\nMy wish is to perform enough good deeds that I get closer to the balance I desire.
{{149328292-1-18508:}}Anyone tried to raise a minotaur yet?
{{149328292-1-18509:}}Stay alert. Those Goblins are tricky.
{{149328292-1-18500:}}The knot is mine by right. I deserve it.
{{149328292-1-18502:}}The only bad part about this plan is that I'm standing here doing nothing.
{{149328292-1-18503:}}Where'd they come from?
{{149328292-1-18504:}}This time we will see victory. Right?
{{149328292-1-18505:}}We need more skeletons. Raise any corpses you find.
{{149328292-1-18506:}}The wraiths are restless. I don't like it.
{{149328292-1-18507:}}I hate fighting Goblins!
{{149328292-3-18360:}}We cannot be stopped!
{{149328292-0-18689:}}Not again, Seremina!\n\nSorry about that. She doesn't want to go for a swim, but she must. And she hates being put away while I talk to others.
{{149328292-0-18685:}}When you see your usual fishing holes start to play out, it's time to find new ones. Overfishing is good for no one.
{{149328292-0-18682:}}When I set out to study the architectural practices of various Imperial cultures, I never thought I'd be standing here painting a tilted house.\n\nNature seems really angry with this particular structure.
{{149328292-0-18683:}}I go away for a few weeks to hunt and I come back to this? This water smells foul. Like when my brother stuck some fish in a basket and forgot about them. But a hundred times that.\n\nNo fish you'd want to eat swim in that water.
{{149328292-6-19095:}}Have you scribed that perfect skill yet? Spilled ink to perfect your favorite spell? \n\nLet's see, maybe I can help.
{{149328292-3-18601:}}Not now! We are exposed here.
{{149328292-3-18600:}}Bring down the barrier!
{{149328292-3-18605:}}This room is familiar!
{{149328292-3-18606:}}Bring the knot back to camp.
{{149328292-3-18609:}}Soon I'll have everything I'm owed and you'll be dead.
{{149328292-3-18608:}}Mercy! I'm too young to die.
{{149328292-1-18742:}}I remember more and more all the time!
{{149328292-1-18743:}}We failed in our duty before. Not this time.
{{149328292-1-18740:}}Mortals are not worthy of the Many Paths.
{{149328292-1-18741:}}The hordes of Apocrypha? Let them come!
{{149328292-0-18233:}}No one will get past me.
{{149328292-0-18232:}}When the time comes, I want my pick of the servants.
{{149328292-0-18231:}}I'm a hunter. No blood vassals for me.
{{149328292-0-18230:}}Too bad Valente couldn't add the elixir to the mead.
{{149328292-0-18234:}}I can't wait to drink someone's blood and try the wine.
{{149328292-2-18618:}}Still alive? Well, I doubt that will last.
{{149328292-2-18617:}}That actually hurt!
{{149328292-2-18616:}}Obliterate the mortals! Leave nothing behind!
{{149328292-2-18615:}}Crush them! End them! Destroy them!
{{149328292-2-18613:}}One extra banner isn't going to keep you from dying like the insects you are.
{{149328292-2-18612:}}The arcane knot is mine. As it always would be. Pathetic.
{{149328292-2-18611:}}Make it hit one of those orbs!
{{149328292-2-18610:}}Focus on the mirrors. Get it to stop!
{{149328292-1-17974:}}My knees creak like the mast of a ship.
{{149328292-1-17975:}}I have so much to do! So many irons in the fire right now! So much to be done!
{{149328292-1-17976:}}My swords are too heavy? Perhaps his arms are too weak.
{{149328292-1-17977:}}He took my book. It had all my notes.
{{149328292-1-17970:}}Skingrad is an oasis of peace and calm in a world of strife.
{{149328292-1-17971:}}That's slander, friend.
{{149328292-1-17972:}}I must have taken a wrong turn.
{{149328292-1-17973:}}Skeevers, they're everywhere!
{{149328292-1-17978:}}Better hang on to your coin purse, friend.
{{149328292-1-17979:}}There is never enough time to do things right, but always time to do things over again.
{{149328292-9-19075:}}I greatly struggled with my condition at first. Still do, if I'm honest. But some of the benefits are amazing.\n\nTraveling while in the form of mist? Incredible. Dexterity and strength improved, too. A shame that becoming undead was the cost.
{{149328292-9-19074:}}While vampirism isn't my most important feature, people always ask about it first. What about my treatise on witch familiars, or my skill as a glass-smith? No, everyone asks about drinking blood.\n\nOh, I just realized! It's because they're scared!
{{149328292-4-19095:}}Ah, hello! Always happy to see your countenance bless these hallowed halls. What do you need?
{{149328292-4-19091:}}I'm glad I'm here, these adepts can barely look out for themselves without someone with a little experience to guide them. Eh?\n\nNot your problem, what can I get you?
{{149328292-0-18742:}}The shardmarshal demands vigilance.
{{149328292-0-18741:}}Our Prince will not be stopped this time!
{{149328292-1-18288:}}Witness Mirrormoor's might!
{{149328292-1-18287:}}Your defiance ends now!
{{149328292-1-18286:}}See your doom in the sky!
{{149328292-1-18285:}}Face the wrath of Mirrormoor!
{{149328292-1-18284:}}We strike as one!
{{149328292-1-18283:}}Together, we spell doom!
{{149328292-1-18282:}}Defeated? Think again!
{{149328292-1-18281:}}We aren't done yet.
{{149328292-2-18402:}}Unlike the Ayleids, Mirrormoor endures.
{{149328292-2-18400:}}Things aren't going to improve around here. Well, they might for me. Hard times are always good for brewers.
{{149328292-2-18401:}}The power of these ruins is ours for the taking.
{{149328292-3-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 04)
{{149328292-0-17922:}}I'll take any coins you don't want, visitor. I know how to spend them!
{{149328292-0-17923:}}Dawnwood is beautiful don't you think?
{{149328292-0-17920:}}There's work for everyone! And more importantly, wine!
{{149328292-0-17921:}}I hear they call the new forest Dawnwood.
{{149328292-0-17926:}}Safer to be here than my usual haunts.
{{149328292-0-17927:}}The Mages Guild has too many rules.
{{149328292-0-17924:}}I can't wait to explore an Ayleid ruin!
{{149328292-0-17925:}}Every tree is part of Y'ffre's domain.
{{149328292-0-17928:}}They sure know how to prepare meat around here. Blunt as a cudgel with their words, though.
{{149328292-0-17929:}}Our town grows larger every day!
{{149328292-4-18618:}}Your plan isn't going to work.
{{149328292-0-18766:}}Target the burning cart! Take them out!
{{149328292-0-18760:}}Once my ritual is complete, no mortal or beast will be able to stop me!
{{149328292-4-18611:}}Use your enemy against themselves.
{{149328292-4-18610:}}Don't let it continue!
{{149328292-1-18580:}}Remain watchful and report anything suspicious!
{{149328292-1-18581:}}Who but King Nantharion could accomplish all this?
{{149328292-1-18582:}}With the Prince's help, the Ayleid Empire will be reborn!
{{149328292-1-18583:}}The rest of Vashabar will see. They'll come crawling back to us.
{{149328292-1-18584:}}West Weald has no idea what's about to happen.
{{149328292-1-18585:}}I hear that traitor Beragon is helping our enemies. If I ever see him ….
{{149328292-1-18586:}}Allying with Dremora? I hope King Nantharion knows what he's doing.
{{149328292-1-18587:}}Remember, we're not supposed to let anyone get by us.
{{149328292-1-18588:}}This land is ours, and the wildburn will prove it!
{{149328292-1-18589:}}Careful!
{{149328292-1-18324:}}Do not waste my time. I know my way around various implements, sharp and blunt, and have no qualms about using them.
{{149328292-1-18325:}}A brave traveler like yourself might be interested in my more adventurous vegetables.
{{149328292-1-18326:}}I just acquired some new items. They have a few leagues and adventures behind them, but they look as good as new.
{{149328292-1-18327:}}I've been working this job for many, many years. I know a bit about what I'm selling, and what I have for you are some of the finest wares I've seen in a while.
{{149328292-1-18320:}}I just received some new soul gems. See if there is anything here that tickles your fancy. If your fancy needs to be tickled, of course.
{{149328292-1-18321:}}We do not apply the word "used" to our stock. Instead we say "vintage" or "well-traveled" or "gently handled.
{{149328292-1-18322:}}Have you seen what the other merchants are offering? The clutter from someone's backyard shed or closet! This one only deals with the most reputable of guilds and brings the savings to you.
{{149328292-1-18323:}}You think it is easy, stuck here among these Imperials? Their politics are childish squabbling compared to the finesse of the Telvanni Masters.
{{149328292-1-18328:}}I have everything that the discerning homeowner needs. You need rocks? I have rocks! You need plants? I have plants! You need weapons? Well, I recommend you find a good blacksmith.
{{149328292-1-18329:}}Come, browse my wares. Run your fingers over the materials. Feel that texture. Drink in those dyes. Have you seen anything so wonderful?

{{149328292-3-18686:}}My accommodations here are somewhat less … prestigious than I'm used to. But it's worth it, to ensure you're adequately supplied in the pursuit of Scribing.
{{149328292-4-18475:}}If you're worried about harming this magnificent specimen, that should be least of your concerns.
{{149328292-4-18477:}}I knew it was going to end this way.
{{149328292-1-17879:}}Take a peek in that barrel. I'm sure it's harmless.
{{149328292-1-17877:}}Did you see that?
{{149328292-1-17876:}}You will feel a mother's vengeance!
{{149328292-8-19075:}}Ever since Count Verandis brought me into House Ravenwatch, I've felt a sense of belonging. I never experienced the lust for power or desire to cause suffering that some vampires display. A loving family like this is precisely what I need.
{{149328292-0-19107:}}Hail.
{{149328292-10-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 11)
{{149328292-2-18318:}}I just got a shipment in from High Isle. I mean, if you like High Isle. I hope you do.
{{149328292-0-18126:}}Out of my way, traveler. I may have been dismissed from the Legion but that doesn't mean I'm ill-prepared for a fight.
{{149328292-2-18317:}}My family came to Cyrodiil from Hammerfell centuries ago, and we have met with nothing but success. This shows what can happen when you don't shy away from hard work.
{{149328292-1-17847:}}Welcome back. West Weald hasn't crumbled yet, so I trust you bear good news?
{{149328292-3-18764:}}Turn the mirrors!
{{149328292-3-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 04)
{{149328292-1-18175:}}I like a heavy sword. My sister says it slows down my attacks, but I like to think my opponents get up a little slower, too. Plus, strong arms mean strong punches.
{{149328292-1-18174:}}Bear in mind, traveler, a smile is not always sincere, and a simple glass of wine may conceal many things. Especially when it is such a delectable red hue. Hmm, I'm getting thirsty.
{{149328292-1-18177:}}I have learned that Colovians appreciate authenticity. That is why I tell them all my goods are genuine Redguard artifacts, even though I make them here in Skingrad. After all, my purse is genuinely empty.
{{149328292-1-18176:}}All this celebrating means the city's going to be a mess tonight. [Sigh.] I suppose I should get back to my post … but no one has to know if I nip a little wine on the way.
{{149328292-1-18173:}}I say, leave the Daedra to the Legion. Between them and Tall Papa, we will be safe. I prefer it when the Legion is out of the city, anyway. Makes my line of work easier.
{{149328292-1-18172:}}A sharp sword is a clean sword. Never forget to clean and maintain your equipment between skirmishes. That was the first thing my masters taught me.
{{149328292-2-18482:}}Are you so confident, or do you just want to die quickly?
{{149328292-2-18483:}}I will feed your souls to Xalvakka myself!
{{149328292-2-18488:}}This is as far as you go!
{{149328292-2-18489:}}Most bones are too brittle. These bones are eternal!
{{149328292-0-18466:}}Whatever that was, I'm glad it's over.
{{149328292-0-18467:}}Thank the Green that's over!
{{149328292-0-18469:}}There's mortals around. I can smell 'em.
{{149328292-1-18435:}}Make sure you don't eat the special food.
{{149328292-1-18436:}}We don't like those ranch rowdies, right?
{{149328292-1-18437:}}What were we hired to do again?
{{149328292-1-18430:}}A few of those Recollection tried to join up here to hide from their problems. I chased those gangly boars back to the forest where they belong. We only have time for the real warriors, not some cultists with memory issues.
{{149328292-1-18431:}}Some fools think they can change the world. I know the only thing that changes is who controls the battlefield.\n\nNow, how can I help you make the change you wish to see?
{{149328292-1-18432:}}If I have what you need, who cares what the price is? You need it. And in these troubled times, who knows if I'll have it the next time you stop by?
{{149328292-1-18433:}}I carefully learned what flavors the Imperials like, and now the Wood Elves want the same treatment? It's a good thing they don't all stick to meat. That would get boring after a few seasons.
{{149328292-1-18438:}}Not sure I like taking orders from a prissy noble.
{{149328292-1-18439:}}When do we get to fight something?
{{149328292-0-18672:}}I still don't understand how Hoperoot fell.

{{149328292-0-18661:}}Feel my arrows' sting!

{{149328292-0-18663:}}Rules, rules, rules. I just want to live my life as fully as possible, but rules keep getting in the way.

{{149328292-0-18665:}}The forest is on our side!
{{149328292-0-18666:}}Once we started the ritual, Ostumir never stood a chance.
{{149328292-0-18667:}}My tharrikers can deal with anything.
{{149328292-0-18668:}}We remember, we rise!
{{149328292-0-18669:}}Soon Dawnwood will cover all of West Weald!

{{149328292-0-18346:}}Sad to say, Nantharion's gone. We won't see his like again. Now who's going to deal with all these Daedra bouncing about?
{{149328292-0-18345:}}I heard that Nantharion and the Recollection were responsible for the Wildburn. To think, I trusted that Elf as my king! Anyway, how can I help you?
{{149328292-0-18344:}}I can tell by the glint in your eye that you're looking for a bargain or three. Take a peek at my wares and see if there is anything that piques your interest!
{{149328292-0-18343:}}When I say I will be there in the morning to start work, I mean any time before midday. Well, midday-ish. Usually by late afternoon, if not sooner.
{{149328292-0-18342:}}My boss said he expected me to work a full day. And I asked, all of it?
{{149328292-0-18341:}}I don't like to sleep in. It interferes with my afternoon nap.
{{149328292-0-18340:}}You know, Skingrad is a good place to find work. I've wandered up and down the Gold Road, and this city is by far the best!
{{149328292-0-18349:}}I understand that Nantharion is responsible for the Wildburn. And that a Daedric Prince supports his activities. Imagine that!\n\nNow, how can I help you?
{{149328292-0-18348:}}I can see at a glance you are a worthy soul. Please, browse through my humble wares. See if I have anything you wish to make your own.
{{149328292-5-19095:}}The key when shopping is never to have your heart set on just one thing. I offer so many treasures, so many secrets. \n\nI mean how can you choose just one? Take a look.
{{149328292-0-18585:}}The people of Skingrad think they are safe. Ha!
{{149328292-0-18584:}}Let our enemies come! I'm ready!
{{149328292-0-18587:}}Those Shardborn are powerful warriors!
{{149328292-0-18586:}}Mirrormoor Daedra are kind of disturbing … but I'm glad they're on our side.
{{149328292-0-18581:}}Soon the Well of Miscarcand will be ours!
{{149328292-0-18580:}}I expected the Colovians. But our own people? They're fools to oppose us!
{{149328292-0-18583:}}We will never forget again!
{{149328292-0-18582:}}Tensions are as taut as my bowstring. What do you think is happening down there?
{{149328292-0-18589:}}Prepare to dodge!
{{149328292-0-18588:}}Have you seen the Prince? Isn't she wondrous?
{{149328292-1-18041:}}Move along. This doesn't concern you.
{{149328292-1-18043:}}Let's find Grivier and Tham.
{{149328292-1-18044:}}They captured me and were taking me to Fort Colovia. Thank you.
{{149328292-2-17849:}}The Legion may be short on time, resources, and soldiers, but there is one thing I can offer you. Gold.\n\nSo, how many items can you help me strike off my list today?
{{149328292-2-17848:}}Return to me when your task is done. In the meantime, my superiors seem to think I need more duties to fill my day. If this keeps up, I'll be buried in paperwork until next season's grape harvest!
{{149328292-0-18172:}}You look weary, traveler. The grime of the road clings to you. Surely your business is not so urgent that you cannot stop for a meal and a bath.
{{149328292-0-18173:}}So much fuss, and for what? The problem has dealt with itself. With the traitorous elf king dead, we can all move on with our lives. Excuse me, wayfarer, I see a coin purse in need of lightening.
{{149328292-0-18174:}}Before you ask, yes, I am what you think I am, and no, I will not tell you how I feed. It's a rude question to begin with. Mortals truly have no manners. No matter. Your lifespans are as flies to us.
{{149328292-0-18175:}}The harder you train, the harder you hit! That's what I always say. If you don't end the day with fresh bruises, you didn't learn anything.
{{149328292-0-18176:}}I'm glad things are quieting down, now. Makes it much easier to do my duty when I don't have to worry about cultists or Daedra or Daedric cultists. Whoever it was, I'm just glad they're gone.
{{149328292-0-18177:}}I wonder if the trees of the new forest are good for woodworking. Do they continue to grow even after you cut them down? Truly a conundrum.
{{149328292-0-18794:}}Vyla uxun, vyla vesek. Vyla uxun, vyla vesek.
{{149328292-0-18795:}}We three, shrouded in glass, summon the forgotten realm.
{{149328292-0-18796:}}We three, shrouded in glass, summon the forgotten realm.

{{149328292-0-19227:}}<Caal glances at Firandil. Seeing a quick nod in response, the scamp fixes you with a wide, slightly sickening smile.>
{{149328292-2-18578:}}Arkay's wrath will find you!
{{149328292-1-18633:}}Hounds! Attack.
{{149328292-1-18631:}}None shall reach our Prince.
{{149328292-1-18636:}}We fight for the Prince of Fate!
{{149328292-1-18634:}}Defend the shrine at all costs!
{{149328292-2-18553:}}Mirrormoor will triumph!
{{149328292-0-19078:}}Just a quick casting in case I'm indisposed. Knowing myself, I may have wandered into circumstances that far exceed my ability to manage. If this is the case, I formally request your help. Please accept my appreciation of your rescue in advance.
{{149328292-0-19076:}}I'd like to properly thank you for your companionship on our adventures. After a life spent in a laboratory, facing real danger feels invigorating. I'd say it makes me feel alive, but, well ….\n\nAnyway, let's chase some danger together again soon.
{{149328292-0-19077:}}As vampires, you and I have a responsibility to the world. We cannot feed on the unwilling or pass on this disease. I understand that hunger you feel. It overrides good sense and morality. But you must stay resolute. Be a force for good, not evil.
{{149328292-0-19074:}}I'm Fennorian of House Ravenwatch. I'm an arcane investigator of sorts. And yes, I'm a vampire. But I'm one of the good ones. Really.
{{149328292-0-19075:}}Of all the downsides, the hunger has always been the worst for me. Before, I could ignore my need for food with sufficient distraction. Now, the blood thirst never leaves my mind. My flask has preserved my sanity on more than one occasion.
{{149328292-0-19072:}}Hard to find opponents these days ….
{{149328292-0-19073:}}Goat races are always so unpredictable, but the most fun to watch!
{{149328292-0-19070:}}If this is fatigue fever, I want it to be over now.
{{149328292-2-17887:}}No! You resisted my illusions!
{{149328292-17-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 18)
{{149328292-2-17886:}}Fodder for the soil!
{{149328292-1-19227:}}<The scamp points to small hand-written sign nearby. Caal: Assistant Chronicler, Familiar to Firandil, Merchant.>
{{149328292-1-18571:}}A lot of preparation goes into the ritual.
{{149328292-1-18570:}}After the wildburn passes, the entire Weald will be ours!
{{149328292-1-18575:}}A change is coming. What was lost will be restored.
{{149328292-1-18574:}}Stay alert. The keepers expect trouble.
{{149328292-1-18577:}}Soon all of West Weald will be ours!
{{149328292-1-18576:}}Keep your eyes open. Unbelievers are everywhere.
{{149328292-1-18579:}}The wildburn destroys the old and gives birth to the new.
{{149328292-1-18578:}}Arkay protect us!
{{149328292-4-18615:}}You're delaying the inevitable.
{{149328292-4-18617:}}You will die. I just need to rest.
{{149328292-4-18616:}}Show them your power!
{{149328292-3-18359:}}Destroy the intruders!
{{149328292-3-18358:}}Let that which has been forgotten be remembered.
{{149328292-2-18336:}}It is good to see a friendly face out here in the hinterlands. How are you this fine day? Can I help you with anything?
{{149328292-0-18509:}}Did you hear something?
{{149328292-0-18508:}}I hope this well is worth the effort.
{{149328292-0-18505:}}Curse these minotaurs and Goblins! They won't keep us from our goal.
{{149328292-0-18504:}}Nothing can go wrong. This plan is great.
{{149328292-0-18507:}}We need to clear out these foul beasts!
{{149328292-0-18506:}}I love working with Ayleid remains.
{{149328292-0-18501:}}Let's fight.
{{149328292-0-18500:}}I sat on a throne made from mortal organs once. It squelched.
{{149328292-0-18503:}}Attack!
{{149328292-0-18502:}}I don't care what your opinion is, roasted flesh smells the best.
{{149328292-0-18264:}}So futile. The kyn will destroy you.
{{149328292-0-18265:}}A small victory. You will not fare as well with the others.
{{149328292-0-18266:}}Vyla Myrr-Mahr, vyla vesek! Vyla Myrr-Mahr, vyla vesek!
{{149328292-0-18267:}}Vyla Myrr-Mahr, vyla vesek! Vyla Myrr-Mahr, vyla vesek!
{{149328292-0-18260:}}You will regret this interruption.
{{149328292-0-18261:}}Witness the power of Mirrormoor!
{{149328292-0-18262:}}Mirrormoor bears witness to your demise.
{{149328292-0-18263:}}You failed, mortals, and you shall keep failing!
{{149328292-0-18268:}}Vyla Myrr-Mahr, vyla vesek! Vyla Myrr-Mahr, vyla vesek!
{{149328292-0-18269:}}Come forth, champion of Mirrormoor!
{{149328292-0-18380:}}What is this strange mosaic?
{{149328292-0-18385:}}Watch for more Daedra.
{{149328292-0-18388:}}Find whatever powers this breach!
{{149328292-2-19227:}}<Caal eyes your coinpurse, muttering something in incomprehensible Daedric to herself.>
{{149328292-10-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 11)
{{149328292-5-18597:}}Suffer together!
{{149328292-3-18492:}}You'll stay here forever!
{{149328292-3-18497:}}Let's see how you fight.
{{149328292-0-18714:}}I've worked in far worse taverns than this. The kind that only serve cheap ale and unkind stares. I haven't had to break up more than two or three fights a night here!
{{149328292-0-17896:}}It's best not to ask too many questions.
{{149328292-0-17894:}}Count Calantius has done a good enough job, for an Imperial. But he should keep his legion at home.
{{149328292-0-17895:}}Ugh, studying is such a bore.
{{149328292-0-17892:}}Thank you for setting us free! The Green bless you!
{{149328292-0-17893:}}We'd still be their puppets if not for you! Y'ffre bless you.
{{149328292-0-17890:}}My head … is clear again!
{{149328292-0-17891:}}I—I don't hear the music anymore!
{{149328292-1-18259:}}Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh. Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh.
{{149328292-1-18250:}}I know some Wood Elves. They're furious with that would-be king of theirs. Furious! Nantharion wore out his welcome in Vashabar.\n\nNow, what do you need?
{{149328292-1-18251:}}I'm glad someone dealt with those Recollection fools. But I still hear rumors about strange Daedric knights running around West Weald. What's that about?
{{149328292-1-18252:}}I don't know what that whole Recollection business was about, but I'm glad it's over. Some kind of Daedric cult, I guess. Well, whoever they were—good riddance!
{{149328292-1-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 02)
{{149328292-2-18433:}}Everyone always has some recipe or dish in mind when they come to me. Well, too bad! I make delicious food. It's incredible. I slaved over this cook fire. I made sure it didn't boil over or burn.\n\nYou will buy my food, and you will enjoy it!
{{149328292-2-18432:}}How large is your purse? I ask only because I have a great deal to sell you. Knowing how much you can spare will make our dealings much easier.
{{149328292-2-18795:}}And forge a throne from the shards that survive.
{{149328292-0-17919:}}Where can I find a mug of rotmeth?
{{149328292-0-17918:}}What's the deal with that new forest?
{{149328292-0-17913:}}My scales feel like sun-baked stones.
{{149328292-0-17912:}}I swear I heard little claws scratching.
{{149328292-0-17911:}}Where have my friends gone? They better not have started drinking without me!
{{149328292-0-17910:}}You dare harm my mushrooms?
{{149328292-0-17917:}}I only fight for a worthy cause.
{{149328292-0-17916:}}I don't need your money. My husband is a prince, you know. I'm sure he'll be back soon.
{{149328292-2-19091:}}I've just come back from another expedition searching for scripts, seeking out secrets. I am quite frankly exhausted.\n\nAnd yet somehow I am still here. Ready and willing to sell you these precious materials.
{{149328292-2-19095:}}If you're looking for something and don't see it, just be patient. If you please. What I have available changes with the whims of the adepts. Whims, I say! \n\nIn the meantime, here's what I do have.
{{149328292-0-18691:}}I live for this time of year. When I'm not stomping grapes, I'm practicing for stomping grapes.\n\nBring on the grapes, I always say! They will be stomped. By me. Bring them all to me!
{{149328292-0-18693:}}Let this be a lesson. The forest belongs to us.
{{149328292-0-18692:}}The wildburn creatures will deal with any survivors.
{{149328292-0-18695:}}They dared harm a tree!
{{149328292-0-18696:}}Search every structure. Leave no survivors.
{{149328292-0-18699:}}It is good to be among clan mates again.
{{149328292-0-18698:}}The ritual proceeds smoothly.
{{149328292-13-19075:}}I'm told that some people find me attractive. My sister Gwendis said that a woman in Northpoint called me cute. I find this confusing, but not unwelcome. Romantic relationships have eluded my investigations so far. Maybe that should end.
{{149328292-3-18655:}}Oh really? The wisps tell me you are mighty and powerful, and don't need their advice to attain your goals. Excellent!
{{149328292-2-18642:}}My twin, come back!
{{149328292-2-18644:}}Prove your worth.
{{149328292-2-19119:}}Let fate renew your vigor, proxy!
{{149328292-4-18590:}}You are powerful.
{{149328292-14-18253:}}(Goblin GIbberish 15)
{{149328292-2-18327:}}I've lived through a couple rulers, and Count Calantius is probably the best one, as far as merchants are concerned. He protects us, and then steps out of the way to let us do our jobs.
{{149328292-2-18325:}}Settle down with a grocer, my friend. Then you will never lack a decent meal.
{{149328292-2-18324:}}I can tell at a glance if someone is serious about their carpentry purchases. Convince me of your intent.
{{149328292-2-18323:}}You see something you want? Great. Purchase it and move on. Let's make this transaction as painless as possible.
{{149328292-2-18322:}}This one should have a better spot to sell such fine wares. But no, this one lacks the influence among the Imperials for such favors. Bah!
{{149328292-2-18321:}}Our wares have seen the heat of battle and survived. The stories they could tell! Yes, they might be a bit scuffed, but that buffs out with a little elbow grease.
{{149328292-2-18320:}}There's nothing like a good book, my uncle always said. But I assume someone as well-read and well-traveled as yourself has seen all of these volumes before.
{{149328292-5-18600:}}It's always crystals here.
{{149328292-5-18474:}}Keep waiting, mortals. It won't change anything.
{{149328292-5-18475:}}I should thank you for the opportunity to try out my masterpiece before I reveal it to the world. But I won't.
{{149328292-5-18477:}}Everything is as it should be.
{{149328292-3-18757:}}Unseen goddess guide my hand, and let the winds be a crutch to my soul.\n\nWell met, traveler.
{{149328292-1-18126:}}What do you want, traveler? I'm no longer a soldier in the Legion, which means brawling with civilians isn't a punishable offense anymore.
{{149328292-1-18124:}}Visiting the cathedral always makes me wonder if the Eight Divines are friends. Do they get together? Share a meal or a drink?\n\nI like to believe they do. After all, eternity is a long time to spend with people you're not fond of.
{{149328292-1-18128:}}Everyone's in high spirits at the moment, but I need something to settle my nerves. Better get moving before the wine runs out.
{{149328292-0-18181:}}Never thought I'd wind up serving criminals and thugs. This is beneath my station. Maybe I should have joined the Legion after all.
{{149328292-0-18180:}}Always know your escape route before you start making trouble. Always! No quicker way to a Legion swordpoint than a bad plan and a dead end.
{{149328292-0-18183:}}This place is enormous.
{{149328292-0-18182:}}You look new here, traveler. Better find some trouble quick, or it will find you first. Speaking of, you should count your coins if you haven't in a while.
{{149328292-0-18184:}}Nothing here but old bones.
{{149328292-0-18187:}}A smile and a laugh can hide many things, including a dagger to the back. Don't forget that while you visit here, traveler. The Wood Elves seem friendly, but they can be fierce as a wolf on the hunt when they want to be.
{{149328292-0-18186:}}My work is good, I swear it! I've become much better at remembering things like taking measurements and sewing up the seams of trousers. By the Green, I'm something of an artist at this point.
{{149328292-0-18189:}}Y'ffre's beard! I've never resented the Green Pact more than right now. Some of the greatest Ayleid ruins are being consumed by this new forest, and no one cares! \n\nI wish I could cut it down. Well, not all of it, obviously. Just a bit.
{{149328292-0-18188:}}Ayleid ruins are a treasure trove of skeletal wonders. The Green reclaimed their flesh long ago, leaving perfectly clean bones behind. Even maggots don't strip the meat so well.
{{149328292-0-18453:}}Reachfolk healers are some of the finest in the world! In our next cultural exchange, I will demonstrate a Reach healing spell.
{{149328292-0-18452:}}I wish we knew what was happening around here.
{{149328292-0-18451:}}Watch out for the new constable and her deputy.
{{149328292-0-18450:}}Who thought training these strange wasps was a good idea?
{{149328292-0-18457:}}I hope you put up a fight.
{{149328292-0-18456:}}This is going to be fun!
{{149328292-0-18455:}}Hey, no one's allowed near my stuff!
{{149328292-0-18454:}}Hello there! Are you a citizen of Vashabar? No? That's fine, I'm still happy to meet anyone passing through this area.
{{149328292-1-17875:}}You'll pay for disturbing us!
{{149328292-1-17874:}}Those roots nearly devoured me. Thank you, traveler.
{{149328292-1-17873:}}The corruption's too strong! Please help!
{{149328292-1-17872:}}Something feels wrong about this tree.
{{149328292-4-18765:}}(Goblin GIbberish 05)
{{149328292-0-18619:}}Bees I can handle, but these wasps? There's not enough gold in Skingrad to make this worth my while.
{{149328292-0-18618:}}How's the morale? Plummeting in the face of your defeat?
{{149328292-0-18611:}}Get it to destroy those orbs!
{{149328292-0-18613:}}Some cloth isn't going to change anything. But if you want to anger your opponents, I won't stop you.
{{149328292-0-18612:}}You never stood a chance.
{{149328292-0-18615:}}Why aren't you dead?
{{149328292-0-18614:}}Kill the mortals quickly.
{{149328292-0-17992:}}Why do I bother? I never win.
{{149328292-0-17991:}}A short visit, than back to the Legion.
{{149328292-0-17990:}}Tava's red feathers! My deepest apologies!
{{149328292-0-18578:}}Get back, foul creature!
{{149328292-0-18574:}}Hoperoot is the first of our living fortresses!
{{149328292-0-18575:}}I'm remembering more and more every day.
{{149328292-0-18576:}}King Nantharion will restore the glory of our people!
{{149328292-0-18577:}}Only fools challenge King Nantharion!
{{149328292-1-18689:}}No more arguing, Seremina. I need to talk to this stranger.\n\nSorry about that. She does go on.
{{149328292-1-18688:}}This esraj is the best thing Fahuren has ever stolen.
{{149328292-1-18683:}}Something happened after I left Skingrad to go on my usual hunting expedition. I'm glad I had plenty of provisions for the return trip because it's dangerous to forage off this land.
{{149328292-1-18682:}}Don't make the mistake of thinking this scholarly artist isn't prepared for whatever the wilds throw his way. The armor I wear isn't for show.\n\nMy companions here left some fool of a bandit for the vultures a few days ago, in fact.
{{149328292-1-18681:}}Great work!
{{149328292-1-18680:}}Keep your eyes open, friend. This place is overrun with wisps and worse.\n\nAnd no sign of my missing friend. Z'en's price, I hate this place.
{{149328292-1-18687:}}Some folks around here expect me to turn down wine because of the Green Pact. But if the wine has the Surilie Reserves label, I'll drink it and then some. It's when the grapes are forcibly plucked from the vines that I have issues.
{{149328292-1-18686:}}Apologies for my poor demeanor today. Sometimes the mystical properties of the Scholarium result in … well. My hair looks terrible right now! \n\nNot your problem, of course. How can I help you?
{{149328292-1-18685:}}My usual spots around the Strid River needed a break from fishing, so here I am! So far, so good.\n\nIt's good to make changes and push yourself from time to time.
{{149328292-1-18684:}}I once adapted a recipe from a Telvanni alchemy primer to use pork as its base meat. The mushroom sauce was creamy and delicious.\n\nOdd to find such a thing in an alchemy book, but I won't judge a horker by its tusks!
{{149328292-1-18355:}}Things have calmed down since the Wildburn has stopped spreading. There are still bandits and creatures about, so you're best off keeping your valuables safe.
{{149328292-1-18354:}}You heard that Nantharion's dead? I'm not surprised. Nothing good comes of dealing with Daedric Princes. Attracts too much attention.
{{149328292-1-18357:}}Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh. Irnak Myrr-mahr, suni zagh.
{{149328292-1-18351:}}Life in Skingrad has calmed now, but that can always change. If you want reliability, take a look at my selection of furnishings.
{{149328292-1-18350:}}I regret the damage Nantharion inflicted on West Weald. However, I can happily report that shipments of new merchandise have resumed.
{{149328292-1-18353:}}Can I hold onto something for you? You can't trust anyone these days, what with Nantharion's people scurrying about. Keep your eyes on your belongings.
{{149328292-1-18352:}}Who are you? What do you want? Oh, perhaps need someone to hold something for you? I can do that. Provided you're the trustworthy type.
{{149328292-1-18359:}}Furried friends. Defend!
{{149328292-1-18358:}}From our three fonts we remake this world.
{{149328292-1-18732:}}I grow bored with all this waiting.
{{149328292-3-18389:}}Try not to hurt them too badly!
{{149328292-0-18291:}}We failed.
{{149328292-0-18293:}}We will return!
{{149328292-0-18292:}}No!

{{149328292-0-18102:}}Have you ever seen anything as magnificent as a glassfish in the current? Many people think fish are simple creatures, but that's not true. There's much we can learn by studying them.
{{149328292-0-18106:}}Winemaking is an art, especially here in the Weald. Much more important than ranching or quarrying. Ontus would be better off if we planted more vineyards.
{{149328292-1-18445:}}Anyone want to play cards at the Stonechip tonight?
{{149328292-1-18444:}}The baron said to watch for intruders.
{{149328292-1-18447:}}I heard those quarriers were up to no good.
{{149328292-1-18446:}}Remember, no one's allowed on the ranch.
{{149328292-1-18441:}}Did the noble order you to chop stone, too?
{{149328292-1-18440:}}I ate some of the lamb stew. Is that a problem?
{{149328292-1-18443:}}Baron Carvain says we need to double production. Again.
{{149328292-1-18442:}}Dark Company, stay alert!
{{149328292-1-18449:}}You think they'll grow big enough to ride? That'd be pretty neat.
{{149328292-1-18448:}}I prefer this work to regular ranching.
{{149328292-2-17877:}}Malacath's mandible! Look at that!

{{149328292-0-18319:}}Felicitations! Are you seeking a restful recumbent position for recovery? Or perhaps a set of serious sundries for your adventuring life?
{{149328292-0-18313:}}So you stop … hang on, let me think this through. So you stop the fermentation process with a neutral spirit, and the wine becomes port. And I say any port in a storm, eh?
{{149328292-0-18314:}}Arrogant Imperials! I miss the Longhouse Emperors.
{{149328292-0-18315:}}Give me a proper lever, I can lift castles. Give me a proper wheel, I can move mountains. Give me the proper tools, and I can work wonders.
{{149328292-0-18317:}}I have run this bank for thirty years, and my mother for thirty years before that. And her mother for thirty years before that. Never in all our time have we mislaid a single coin or valuable.
{{149328292-0-19047:}}I can't believe I followed King Nantharion out of Valenwood without suspecting anything. It all sounded so good—a place where no one could tell us what to do. But it was all a lie, wasn't it?
{{149328292-0-19046:}}I spend my days looking down, searching for beautiful bones. But maybe I should look up every now and then. I might have seen that King Nantharion wasn't who he said he was.
{{149328292-0-19045:}}If you think you have anywhere else to go, you're mistaken.
{{149328292-0-19044:}}I expected better from King Nantharion. He thought he fooled everyone, did he? Ha! In Morrowind, we don't let plots come to light before it's too late to do anything about them.\n\nAmateur.
{{149328292-0-19043:}}I have to admit, I was shocked to hear that King Nantharion was behind the Recollection all along. I thought I left that sort of conspiring behind when I left Morrowind.
{{149328292-0-19049:}}You fight in my army now.
{{149328292-0-19048:}}Finally! I hope you fight well.
{{149328292-1-18625:}}I'm ready to sink my blade into mortal guts.
{{149328292-1-18624:}}Mortal homes always smell awful.
{{149328292-1-18627:}}Tragedies bring travel companions closer, but coin does endear them to me more.
{{149328292-1-18623:}}You are no match for me.
{{149328292-1-18622:}}All this for some wine? I hope it's worth it.
{{149328292-3-19075:}}Adusa-daro's clarity of mind never fails to impress me. I try to mimic her decisiveness, but often get lost in the analysis of details.\n\nShe has trained me in some excellent taunts, though. May your fur itch and grow patchy! See?
{{149328292-3-19074:}}I once investigated a woman and her bird. She claimed to still hear her beloved creature's song weeks after her pet's tragic death.\n\nTurns out the fox who ate the bird now sung the very same tune outside her window each night. Quite eerie.
{{149328292-0-18556:}}I remember everything now.
{{149328292-0-18554:}}Another mortal ruin. Why is our Prince so interested in these?
{{149328292-0-18555:}}Soon, Mirrormoor shall be fit to inhabit again.
{{149328292-0-18552:}}The valkynaz leads us to victory.
{{149328292-0-18553:}}For Mirrormoor!
{{149328292-0-18558:}}Are we looking for something? No one tells me anything.
{{149328292-0-18559:}}Do you remember what Mirrormoor was like before the shattering?
{{149328292-0-18690:}}I advise you to leave the area. My egg-kin are shy. They will not show themselves while you are here.\n\nPlease do not take it personally. They simply do not like strangers.
{{149328292-0-18694:}}We remember. We never forget.
{{149328292-0-18697:}}It's no fun when they die so fast.
{{149328292-6-19074:}}Blood? An acquired taste. My first few days as a vampire required choking down that viscous liquid.\n\nBut I've come to accept and even appreciate its nuanced flavors. My favorite comes from a highly relaxed Nord. I would describe it as crisp.
{{149328292-6-19075:}}My interest in the healing arts began as a way to study alchemy, but it's since grown very important to me. Once I became a creature that typically heralds death, I wanted to move in the other direction. Sustaining life feels more valuable now.
{{149328292-3-18454:}}I'm happy to be here, but the diet takes some adjustment. Not all these people are strict followers of the Green Pact, but many inherited the traditional cuisine.
{{149328292-1-19058:}}The sun is shining bright and the air smells sweet, yet I have a feeling something terrible just missed us. Call it a soldier's hunch.\n\nThe funny thing is, I have no idea what it was.
{{149328292-1-19051:}}My faith in the Dawnway is shaken. I've been fascinated by my Ayleid heritage my whole life, but I'm embarrassed to admit it now. I have nothing to do with the Recollection—or that fugitive king of ours.
{{149328292-1-19050:}}Don't underestimate me!
{{149328292-1-19053:}}I hear King Nantharion was allied with the Recollection, but I never noticed. The flowers and the forest creatures told me nothing of these troubles. And I was happier for it.
{{149328292-1-19052:}}King Nantharion made terrible mistakes, yet I am saddened by his death. Embracing our Ayleid heritage—parts of it, at least—was a lofty goal. But nothing good grows in soil watered by lies.
{{149328292-1-19055:}}I was about to return to the Imperial City and publish my research on Bosmer cultural traditions. But how can I leave? I must see how Vashabar's clans choose a new leader now that the king's perfidy is known to all!
{{149328292-1-19054:}}I'm glad to see a hero here. King Nantharion's disappearance leaves Vashabar with a hole in its heart. These elves must decide who they are without him.\n\nSomeone like you could be an inspiration to them.
{{149328292-1-19057:}}I'm glad someone put an end to Nantharion's mischief. I can't tell you how much it galled me to learn he was behind everything our Colovian neighbors feared about us. Some king he turned out to be!
{{149328292-1-19056:}}I've been looking for a chance to cross blades with some of those Recollection fanatics, and it turns out Hoperoot was full of them. If only I had known it sooner!
{{149328292-8-18596:}}I will not be defeated!
{{149328292-8-18594:}}Meddle somewhere else!
{{149328292-3-18553:}}This realm belongs to Mirrormoor now!
{{149328292-4-18596:}}This is my destiny!
{{149328292-4-18594:}}You are nothing!
{{149328292-0-18330:}}This one has traveled to the far corners of the globe, which is quite an accomplishment when you realize that globes do not have corners.
{{149328292-0-18140:}}You forget to place one little glyph on one little sword, and all of a sudden everyone's pointing fingers at you. What were they doing that was so important? Training? I was on a very good part of my book!
{{149328292-1-18197:}}The legionaries never knew what hit 'em!
{{149328292-1-18196:}}We claim this fort in the name of the Recollection!
{{149328292-1-18195:}}You can relax here, traveler. The clan doesn't bite. Usually. Just don't bring up the Green Pact. Or the Dawnway. As a matter of fact, you should keep your opinions to yourself.
{{149328292-1-18194:}}My research here continues to yield results. Insights like these mean I'll be able to continue my studies in the Imperial City. With any luck, I'll never have to return to my old stronghold. I prefer to leave the brute force to others.
{{149328292-1-18193:}}I still haven't adjusted to the high amount of meat the Wood Elves consume. Last night, I nearly offered to gather some fruit to share with them before I remembered their aversion to harvesting crops. I'll just have to wait for a windfall.
{{149328292-1-18192:}}I never thought I'd miss Skingrad, but there's nothing to drink here except fermented milk and meat juice. I'd take an axe to the face for a bottle of wine to toast a job well done.
{{149328292-1-18191:}}Look, I know it doesn't look appetizing, but I promise my scamp gut rotmeth will change your life. Or at least your taste buds. It leaves a very strong taste in the mouth. I'm still balancing the flavors.
{{149328292-1-18190:}}If you're ever lost in the woods and need a place to rest, don't trust the birds. They have terrible taste. And by the Green, it's hard to sleep in a tree.
{{149328292-1-18199:}}This place, like all of this land, belongs to us!
{{149328292-1-18198:}}The next legionary I find gets fed to my welwa.
{{149328292-1-18225:}}Why aren't we allowed to attend the auction?
{{149328292-1-18224:}}Remember, no one's allowed down here.
{{149328292-1-18226:}}Valente talks big, but he better follow through on his promises.
{{149328292-0-18381:}}What a strange design.
{{149328292-2-17910:}}My illusions can't be broken so easily!
{{149328292-0-18389:}}Please don't attack!

{{149328292-4-18481:}}Fight someone else.
{{149328292-0-17944:}}So many lovely things for sale!
{{149328292-0-17945:}}Magic makes life easier.
{{149328292-0-17946:}}I appreciate that the Wood Elves welcomed me into their community.
{{149328292-0-17947:}}Come closer, friend! One touch and I'll share with you the blessing of Peryite!
{{149328292-0-17940:}}My honor is worth more than a bag of coins.
{{149328292-0-17941:}}I told my dearest not to leave! Now I'm all alone here.
{{149328292-0-17942:}}Doesn't anybody want to spar?
{{149328292-0-17943:}}I plan to return to Necrom and become an Oathman, like my sister.
{{149328292-0-17948:}}Ah, the clink of coins. I love the bank.
{{149328292-0-17949:}}Are there no revels in this town?
{{149328292-0-18390:}}What's so special about this seed again?
{{149328292-0-18391:}}We're really related to these old Wild Elves?
{{149328292-0-18392:}}I'm still not comfortable working with Daedra.
{{149328292-0-18393:}}We really got the drop on those legionaries!
{{149328292-0-18394:}}Those things … they're unnatural.
{{149328292-0-18395:}}Keep clear of those tendrils!
{{149328292-0-18396:}}Those storms look dangerous.
{{149328292-0-18397:}}Such wind! Where's it coming from?
{{149328292-0-18398:}}Lightning! Avoid it if you can!
{{149328292-0-18399:}}These storms! They're coming from the breach!
{{149328292-1-18545:}}What is a Goblin good for anyway?
{{149328292-1-18543:}}This is no where near as bad as a Tharriker.
{{149328292-1-18549:}}Stay alert! The Legion could send a real cohort at any time.
{{149328292-4-18523:}}The death of Nantharion … well, it doesn't impact my diplomatic mission in Vashabar. Yet I still regret it. All deaths impact the living to one degree or another.
{{149328292-0-18756:}}Was something supposed to happen? Maybe check the book again.
{{149328292-0-18757:}}Blessed be the name of Stendarr, the God of Mercy. He strengthens and unifies …. \n\nAh, greetings.
{{149328292-0-18758:}}A tribute aspirant. Wonderful. I pray to Dibella, to hear her beautiful music as I face this challenge.
{{149328292-0-18759:}}Use Abolisher to close the portal!
{{149328292-1-18522:}}Transform this realm to crystal!
{{149328292-1-18523:}}Serving as one of Ard Caddach's few ambassadors is a true honor. He leapt at the chance to send someone to this fledgling kingdom. I was fortunate to win the post.
{{149328292-1-18520:}}Destroy all who oppose Mirrormoor!
{{149328292-1-18526:}}Anyone have any extra arrows to spare?
{{149328292-1-18527:}}Once word gets around, the Dark Company will be famous!
{{149328292-1-18528:}}This fort has certainly seen better days.
{{149328292-1-18529:}}One of those recruits called me a deserter. We're mercenaries now, damn it!
{{149328292-1-18724:}}Even wild growth needs tending.
{{149328292-1-18725:}}New forest? Looks like old Valenwood to me.
{{149328292-1-18726:}}No one to talk to in Black Marsh and no one to talk to here.
{{149328292-1-18727:}}Some around here seek to protect their own safety at the expense of another's freedoms. I hope they learn that uncertainty is a part of life before their fears stifle the rest of us.
{{149328292-1-18728:}}I visit the traders here each day. Some have new wares. Some have standard stock, but like to share things they've learned from visitors.\n\nErgo, I recommend you visit the traders not only for goods, but also for information that can keep you alive.
{{149328292-1-18729:}}Keep the portal open!
{{149328292-1-18092:}}Ontus is overflowing with new arrivals. I suppose I'm one, too, although I keep a lower profile than these Redguards. My employers generally prefer discretion in my line of work.
{{149328292-1-18093:}}I do my work and rush right home. The fever isn't going to catch me!
{{149328292-1-18096:}}I wonder if I should resign from the Legion and stay here in Ontus to help my family. I like being a soldier, but my father needs me.
{{149328292-1-18094:}}Have you heard about all the workers who died? They say it's some kind of illness!
{{149328292-1-18095:}}I yearn for the day when the Prince of Trickery brings me to his side. I will stroke the fur of Barbas, and enforce my master's pacts on Nirn. That day cannot come soon enough.
{{149328292-1-17846:}}All of my tasks have been dealt with for the moment. Return later and I am certain to have something else for you to do. Count Calantius and the Imperial Legion appreciate your interest.
{{149328292-1-17848:}}Remember, the Legion is relying on you. Moreover, I am relying on you. Please, do not become another problem for me to solve.
{{149328292-1-17849:}}Joining the Legion was supposed to be a great honor. I never imagined it would be this stressful.\n\nHonestly, West Weald faces threats on all sides and the Legion could use all the help we can get.
{{149328292-2-18631:}}Mirrormoor shall not fall this day.
{{149328292-0-18215:}}I can never tell from the day's rumors whether we're in danger or everything is fine. Either way, I'm glad you stopped by. Hopefully you'll find me trustworthy.
{{149328292-0-18214:}}This bank has no affiliation with any ruler. If something like that Nantharion business happens here, your valuables won't be seized. That's the Kharzurz promise.
{{149328292-0-18216:}}Over the years, I've built a reputation as a trustworthy banker. So, I hope no one finds out I sometimes forget to lock the door.\n\nNo, wait, why did I say that out loud?
{{149328292-0-18211:}}I thought I was done for.
{{149328292-0-18210:}}Help! Someone! Anyone!
{{149328292-0-18213:}}Don't mind me. No one cared when I was alive, and no one cares now that I'm dead.
{{149328292-0-18212:}}Thank you for saving me!
{{149328292-1-17958:}}Sometimes you only need a friend to hear your sorrows.
{{149328292-1-17959:}}This one wonders what the count plans to do about that jungle.
{{149328292-1-17956:}}Ugh, please don't remind me of the town gowns. I know I designed them, but they're incredibly out of season. Why did I ever think draping sheer linen was a good idea? \n\nNo matter. Skingrad's fashion only moves forward, as do I.
{{149328292-1-17954:}}I can't wait for the next vineyard expansion. More vines means more grapes means more wine!
{{149328292-1-17955:}}My family had an estate once. The Shadowed Path burned it down.
{{149328292-1-17952:}}Narsis Dren? A fabulist, of course, but there are bits of truth in his wild tales.
{{149328292-1-17953:}}Are the quarriers starting trouble again?
{{149328292-1-17950:}}I'd never make a good legionary.
{{149328292-0-18482:}}I suppose I can incite my minions to kill you faster.
{{149328292-0-18483:}}The time of Xalvakka draws near!

{{149328292-0-18764:}}The mirrors. Focus them!
{{149328292-1-18118:}}Those Recollection bandits aren't long for this world. My employer has already provided my next assignment. Excuse me, my blades need sharpening.
{{149328292-1-18117:}}Whether or not Skingrad is at war with its neighbors, there will always be work for assassins here. Politicians have opponents, soldiers hold grudges, and Colovians have long memories when it comes to the ways they've been wronged.
{{149328292-1-18116:}}I prefer to stay out of current affairs. My job's easier the less I know about my targets.
{{149328292-1-18114:}}Everyone is celebrating, but it feels like a cold wind just passed over me. I can't quite remember what I was doing before this. Strange. I'll have to see what wisdom my ancestors can offer.
{{149328292-1-18113:}}With the Legion at our side, I'm positive they'll have this business with the Daedra cleared up shortly. In fact, I think a celebration may soon be in order. I'll alert the ancestors!
{{149328292-1-18112:}}Perhaps we ought to do something for the Wood Elves in their time of strife. I'm not sure what though … I'll consult my ancestors at their tomb and see what wisdom they can offer.
{{149328292-0-18404:}}Look sharp! Imperials could be anywhere!
{{149328292-0-18405:}}You hear funny stories in a tavern. I don't much care if they're real or not. A new Daedric Prince? That's a story worth spreading. It'll sell the ale.
{{149328292-0-18406:}}That fool Dark Elf played right into our hands.
{{149328292-0-18407:}}That fool's notes are barely legible. They're useless!
{{149328292-0-18400:}}We'll all get torn to pieces by those monsters in the green woods one of these days. Might as well drink while you can.
{{149328292-0-18401:}}There is powerful energy here.
{{149328292-0-18402:}}I remember when the Ayleids were vibrant and alive.
{{149328292-0-18403:}}I miss Valenwood.
{{149328292-0-18408:}}The Recollection never tempted me. I'm in the business of helping people forget things. Not dragging bad memories back up.
{{149328292-0-18409:}}No one stands in the way of the Recollection.
{{149328292-9-18594:}}I will kill you all!
{{149328292-2-18469:}}Only good mortal is a dead one.
{{149328292-2-18473:}}No, they're not here for architecture. They are here to die.
{{149328292-2-18472:}}I needed some action!
{{149328292-2-18471:}}Fresh blood to spill!
{{149328292-2-18477:}}You should have died earlier and saved us both some time.

{{149328292-1-17992:}}Dice, cards, wagers … doesn't matter. I can't win a thing.
{{149328292-1-17991:}}I wonder where the Legion will send me next?
{{149328292-2-17853:}}We've learned that you must defeat a powerful Mirrormoor champion to repel an incursion. Be warned: You can't overcome the champion until you kill the Shardborn valkynazes shielding it.\n\nReport back after you stop an incursion. And good luck!

{{149328292-2-17854:}}It is said that Onsi sets a light in the face and a spring in the stride of a victorious warrior. If I am not mistaken, that is what I see now.\n\nHow did you fare, hero?
{{149328292-2-18486:}}Some mortals to practice on!
{{149328292-2-18487:}}Remember your oaths. Hold this chamber and let no one pass.
{{149328292-2-18371:}}You may ask, what does a Khajiit know of these lands? Rakamati will tell you. He walked the Gold Road with old Imperials. They taught his feet and eyes the way. You can trust Rakamati.

{{149328292-0-18489:}}This place adds so much to my army.
{{149328292-0-18485:}}That lofty Dremora won't get far. Not here.

{{149328292-0-18487:}}The energy is changing. Something shifted, can you feel it?
{{149328292-0-18480:}}You should run from the darkness.
{{149328292-0-18481:}}I don't want to deal with you.
{{149328292-1-18418:}}Open your eyes! Balandrus expects trouble.
{{149328292-1-18419:}}To what do I owe the honor of your patronage? Interest in magical assistance? The looming threat of conflict? Curiosity? \n\nRegardless, I welcome it and you. Please, let me know what you'd like to purchase.
{{149328292-1-18416:}}Where's the latest group of townsfolk? I'm hungry!
{{149328292-1-18417:}}You missed some fool spouting off about how we were all safe thanks to the Legion. I had to cut him off for drinking too much. Thinking things are safe is a sign you've had too much.
{{149328292-1-18414:}}We should have killed that fool Dark Elf when we had the chance.
{{149328292-1-18415:}}We claim this ruin in the name of the Recollection!
{{149328292-1-18412:}}I hope I find the relic.
{{149328292-1-18413:}}Don't let anyone else enter the ruins.
{{149328292-1-18410:}}Stay alert. These ruins are covered in traps.

{{149328292-3-18544:}}Which camp is this one from?
{{149328292-3-18545:}}These Goblins are so stupid.
{{149328292-0-18648:}}Those Shardborn look dangerous!
{{149328292-0-18649:}}Your presence here indicates that you're interested in Storm Lord matters. If that's not the case, then please don't interrupt my post-battle recovery time.
{{149328292-0-18642:}}Return to me, my other half!

{{74148292-0-549:}}Alternative paths to Gold Road include traveling by cart or boat from the alliance capital cities or by employing the Wayshrine network.
{{74148292-0-560:}}Scribing quest progress is specific to each character, and the full questline is always available. Each character will have to complete the tutorial quest "The Second Era of Scribing" to gain access to the Scholarium.\n\nHowever, once you complete a quest in the Scribing questline the benefits you gain from that quest are available to all characters on your account from that point forward.
{{74148292-0-562:}}Completion of each Wing also unlocks Scripts of the relevant type on vendors. Seek out Chronicler Firandil in the Scholarium and Filer Ool in the Infinite Archive, both of whom rotate their stock each week.\n\nThe benefits of completing Scholarium Wings are available on all characters across your account. That said, you cannot access the Scribing Altar or the Scholarium without completing the quest "The Second Era of Scribing" on your other characters.\n\nA variety of Scripts will become available thanks to the generosity of the Mages Guild Archmagister upon completion of the Wing of the Dragon. Seeking those Scripts is detailed in the Help file "Mages Guild Subsidized Scripts." The Class Mastery Signature script is only available by seeking out Class Script Scraps, detailed in the Help file "The Class Mastery Script.
{{74148292-0-558:}}As account-wide unlocks, these benefits are available immediately upon playing other characters. However, you must still complete the quest "The Second Era of Scribing" to give a character access to the Scribing Altar and the Scholarium. \n\nIf you have completed "The Wing of the Indrik", Chronicler Firandil will be at his station in the Scholarium immediately upon completing "The Second Era of Scribing.
{{74148292-0-551:}}When you arrive, pick up the quest The Knot Awaits from Keshargo. This quest is repeatable, so you can experience Lucent Citadel as often as you like. But remember, you can only receive the rewards from this quest once per week.\n\nPlayers can compete for fame and glory on the Trials Leaderboards.
{{74148292-0-550:}}The Scribing quest content consists of six exciting new quests. As you progress through these quests, your new allies will unlock access to the Scribing system and materials. You'll gain the ability to purchase powerful Grimoires, the basic templates for your unique and customizable new skills. \n\nThese skills are then crafted at the Scribing Altar by adding powerful Scripts to their pages. There are many different types of Scripts, each of which fundamentally changes how the resulting Scribed Skill works … right down to who the skill targets and what kind of damage it does.
{{74148292-0-553:}}From the Scribing menu, select the Grimoire you wish to craft as a Scribed Skill.\n\nChoose the Focus, Signature, and Affix Script you want to use. You must choose one Focus, one Signature, and one Affix Script to craft a Scribed Skill. Note that not all Scripts are compatible with all Grimoires, and not all Scripts are compatible with each other. \n\nOnce the Grimoire has one of each Script type, |cFFFFFFPress|r <<1>> to craft your Scribed Skill. Luminous Ink will be consumed for each Script you add or change to your Scribed Skill. For example, three Luminous ink will be consumed the first time you Scribe a skill.\n\nYou can change the Scripts on a Scribed Skill as many times as you like, creating new versions of the skill for as long as you have enough Luminous Ink. Only Luminous Ink is consumed in crafting a Scribed Skill, Grimoires and Scripts are permanently unlocked and may be used as many times as you wish. Experiment as much as you like to find the right Scribed Skill for your build.
{{74148292-0-555:}}There are three types of Scripts: Focus, Signature and Affix.\n\n|cFFFFFFFocus Scripts|r define the main function of a Scribed Skill. This might change the type of damage the skill does, or whether the ability targets enemies or allies. Focus Scripts also determine the cost of the ability and whether it takes Magicka or Stamina to use.\n\n|cFFFFFFSignature Scripts|r can enhance the effects of the Focus Script, trigger a unique interaction with an existing mechanic, or add secondary attributes to the Scribed Skill.\n\n|cFFFFFFAffix Scripts|r adds buffs or debuffs to the Scribed Skill, depending on the targets the resulting Skill affects.\n\nNot all Scripts can be applied to all Grimoires. Also, not all Scripts that are compatible with a Grimoire are compatible with each other. Collect and experiment to discover combinations that work for you.
{{74148292-0-563:}}Skill Styles can be earned by unlocking achievements and completing quests, as well as by purchasing them in the Crown Store.
{{74148292-0-554:}}Grimoires also require having completed specific achievements related to the skill line associated with the Grimoire. For example, you must complete the Achievement "Bow Apprentice" to purchase the Grimoire for the Bow skill Vault.\n\nOnce a Grimoire has been acquired on a character, other characters on your account can purchase them from Chronicler Firandil in the Scholarium at a discounted price.

{{15453358-2-689:}}Good catch with those trees. The Gentle Prince was very popular among Colovian children in the early Second Era. Most likely this was hung in a child's bedroom or playroom. Merchant families loved the story of a Prince gaining wealth from hard work.
{{15453358-2-688:}}Ah, another classic tapestry from the great weaver Rhea Truiand. Her work was in high demand among estates in the last First Era. In fact, a brutal feud started between two families over one of her pieces. Perhaps this very one!
{{15453358-2-687:}}It's not for merchants. This is a Redguard military map. See the emphasis on the landscape over cities or towns.? An invading force needs to know the safest paths through the region. Based on its age, I suspect this comes from the War of Rihad.
{{15453358-2-685:}}Spot-on as always, Reginus! In fact, the carvings around this mirror are indicative of Daedric worship, specific to the First Era. With the right spell, this mirror could be used to view other planes. I wonder if those other planes could look back?
{{15453358-2-684:}}I'm also intrigued by the engraved decorations. Looks like a ring of bears dancing around the outside of the decanter. I suppose Count Calantius's love for his ursine companion has historical precedent.
{{15453358-2-683:}}After Reginus' time with the Aureal cameo I thought it might be interesting to bring both companion pieces together for co-examination. A note here for the files: never do that again. My eyebrows are still growing in and Reginus will be bruised for weeks.
{{15453358-2-669:}}My colleagues did not recognize this as Dwemer work. The Dwemer had few sources for leather of exceptional quality, so they sometimes obtained materials from Ayleid artisans. But they would have only used it for work of great importance.
{{15453358-2-698:}}Focus on the lenses. It appears to concentrates light rays when the sun is at its peak and stores it in the crystal. Simple, yet resourceful. Even now, welkynd burns bright in their ruins.
{{15453358-2-699:}}Actually, this slab may be even older than Verita thinks. The polish of the stone, the smoothness of the lines, they all point to Ayleid culture! Rocks can teach us so many things!
{{15453358-2-690:}}Be fair to yourself, Gabrielle. This isn't your specialty. The tapestry depicts the long-destroyed gateway to the Cruscellio lands. That family line was supposedly wiped out, but claiming lineage has become popular.
{{15453358-2-691:}}This painting is of the 'Lady of the Vine' folkstory. It's confirmed by the scroll at her feet. The Lady also looks a lot like a portait of Countess Ornelda Calvus, which makes sense since she published the first record of that story as well.
{{15453358-2-692:}}There was a master vase painter in Cropsford in the early second era who specialized in black figure pottery. All the details you see here are extremely difficult to get precise with the pottery slip. This has to be Martina Russus's work.
{{15453358-2-693:}}I found a book from called 'Scholar's Rite' by Telburnalin. It looks like these trees were crafted for Ayleid scholars. Each branch represents the students they guided to enlightenment.
{{15453358-2-694:}}I looked into the combination of the tree shape and materials used to make this tree and I think it was connected to a ritual of Magnus. The Ayleids had temples dedicated to sight, light, and insight and it's possible this was created by one of them.
{{15453358-2-695:}}I'd wager it was how you put it to them, Verita. As for this sculpture, the Ayleids in the past used Welkynd to store magicka. Small cracks in the crystals might be letting it seep through.
{{15453358-2-696:}}I sense a faint trace of Daedric influence on parts of it, far from dangerous now. This might be the remnants of a Daedraphile kingdom after the Alessian slave rebellion. No, I'm certain of it!
{{15453358-2-697:}}I've never known welkynd to crack from too much magic. But you're right, Amalein. This window wasn't meant for simple gazing. And someone saw something they shouldn't have with this.
{{15453358-2-676:}}Verita's correct. I read a story of a watchman in Alinor who accidentally embedded a fleck of gloamium in his eye in 2E 367. The story goes that he lost sight during the day, but could see perfectly well at night . I bet these rivets do the same.
{{15453358-2-677:}}We found several more writings about this liquid that were previously viewed as farcical. If enough of it is used, the material becomes nearly impossible to detect. I'm glad this sample is tightly sealed.
{{15453358-2-674:}}I strongly sense the chill of Evergloam, good guess Amalien. Imagine what a thief might do with a set of gloves or a mask stitched with these? The power of the Shadow Queen herself imbued into a garment. Oh my.
{{15453358-2-672:}}Ah, I know this design! This repeating squared-arrow pattern comes from Santaki, a Dwemer city that stood in what is now the Alik'r Desert. This was part of a mighty armored gauntlet crafted by the Rourken smiths of Hammerfell long ago.
{{15453358-2-673:}}My colleague's insight serves her well. I have seen similar mechanisms in the Dwemer ruins of Stros M'Kai. The smiths of Bthzark were skilled in the art of tonal architecture. I think these pipes were fitted to gauntlets that harnessed tonal magic.
{{15453358-2-670:}}Aetherium crystals powered many Dwemer marvels, yes. But this is not a simple power source. Somehow, this crystal has been hollowed out. I believe this is a resonance chamber for a device harnessing Dwemer tonal magic. An incredible find!
{{15453358-2-671:}}These are no common picks. The high artisans of Volenfell often began important projects by forging the tools they would need for the work. I believe these tools were made to craft a special piece of armor, and likely never used again.
{{15453358-2-678:}}The poems reference knights and knaves so I think they deal with the Blackfeather Court. There's a record of an Imperial scribe going missing in 2E 219. The scribe was found several days later with a pocket full of jewels. Payment, I suppose.
{{15453358-2-682:}}The other artisan to this piece was, for lack of a better phrase, a mad genius. Artistry for the sake of it, needless complexity, to the point where their half of the yoke is most likely quite difficult to actually slip into place against a chain.
{{15453358-2-681:}}I can confirm after a visit Reginus' desk that this cameo is indeed "making faces" at him. I've arranged a consulation with an Arcanist Gabrielle knows through her correspondence series, perhaps he will have some insights into this phenomenon.
{{15453358-2-680:}}I referenced the University's collection of Dementia-crafted items, to great success. Originating in that cursed county seat within the Shivering Isles, this clasping no doubt bears a tragic tale all its own.
{{15453358-2-708:}}Gabrielle is spot-on. It's the trigger for a music box. I had one as a child, and it had the same sort of teeth at the end. The crystalcruft ornament is decorative, probably made to complement the overall design of the music box it came from.
{{15453358-2-706:}}I knew it! I couldn't sleep last night and found myself musing over the mirror. The cracks are intentional! When gently manipulated, the shards can slide together to create a smooth reflective surface. Ayleid craftsmanship never ceases to amaze me.
{{15453358-2-707:}}I haven't seen one of these since I was a child. It's a music box. Amalien was surprisingly astute with the keys, but even her nimble fingers can't get the melody to play. I'm eager to hear whatever ancient song this box contains.
{{15453358-2-702:}}Don't strain yourself, Gabrielle. The markings aren't runes or enchantments. It's an inscription. It reads: 'To my stalwart smith with love. May your back never ache and your fire never dim.'
{{15453358-2-703:}}Moreover, has anyone noticed how relatively small the anvil is? Its size suggests the smith had a proclivity for forging precision tools like daggers or arrowheads over swords or axes. You can't overlook the details on these things!
{{15453358-2-701:}}Yes, Ugron, strength and flexibility are important, but we're talking about the Ayleids here! Their culture was infused with magic. Their decoctions probably contained elements to enchant their tools and weapons as they forged them.
{{15453358-1-699:}}An astute observation from Gabrielle, but the cut of this slab is what intrigues me. It's certainly not natural - perhaps it had some use among historic Nedic peoples.
{{15453358-1-695:}}Gwylim has a similar sculpture. I once pointed out how similar Ayleid and Aldmeri architecture are and was met with glares from students. I wonder if they're even aware of who our founder is.
{{15453358-1-694:}}See how the tree grows right out of the base? I'm certain this was cast all at once from Meteoric Iron. The Ayleids used Aetherial materials a lot in their construction. Meteoric Iron binds really well to the stone used in their carvings.
{{15453358-1-679:}}I quite like transfixing. Definitely Daedric, but the links are made from an alchemical admixture of saltwater. The tomes I referenced indicate there are only a few realmic bodies that might fit the bill. Notes back to you Amalien.
{{15453358-2-704:}}Finally got a chance to examine this again when Verita wasn't looking. Further analysis suggests this is an Ayleid decoration of some kind. It resembles the ornaments we've found on some of their larger remnants, like their palanquins and staffs.
{{15453358-2-705:}}Of course it's miniature, it's a child's toy! Or a novelty item of some sort. Not everything is as serious as Ugron wants it to be. This item broke off at some point long ago. Even so, it would have been an exquisite gift, from all the detail.
{{15453358-2-700:}}I can tell you've both been neglecting your arcane studies a bit. Don't those cracks remind you of anything? Perhaps some magically-charged Ayleid ruins? This smith likely made enchanted weapons.
{{15453358-1-698:}}Alessia and her rebellion were quick to attack. Creating a weapon with something they knew little about would be impractical. This must be when they were just testing its capabilities.
{{15453358-1-697:}}Of course! Welkynd stores magical energy. The dials help distribute the energy and act as pockets for them. To peer into other realms, maybe? Perhaps the magic was too great and caused the cracks?
{{15453358-1-696:}}I treated those that brought it here to some mead. Many Ayleid ruin structures hold meteoric iron, but part of me feels that this one's eerie grandeur was meant to be flaunted outside. Not a ruin.
{{15453358-1-693:}}I know that Aylied's held trees in high regard. There are known symbols of knowledge which include threes and branches. I haven't seen a tree sculpture in any of the ruins I've been to, but it does not seem out of place for this to carry the same meaning.
{{15453358-1-692:}}That vibrant red comes from crushed hot peppers imported from Esroniet. They were unbelievably popular in Cyrodiil around 2E 53. I found evidence of a growing Sanguine cult gaining footholds in the Imperial City at the time as well.
{{15453358-1-691:}}I'm more interested in the story behind the painting than the trees in it. There aren't many folktales that this fresco could be showing but I think it's either the 'Lady of the Vine' or 'The Widow's Bull'. Both originated in Colovia around 2E 107.
{{15453358-1-690:}}I agree with your analysis, Reginus, though which estate could it be? That type of architecture came into fashion during the Second Empire, and that vine work has always been popular. However, I don't recognize the region.
{{15453358-1-675:}}It strikes me as odd that there would be runes for successful hunts etched into the inside of these leathers. Unless the wearer didn't want to give their intentions away, or they didn't want to show an allegiance to Hircine.
{{15453358-1-674:}}I wouldn't just call this "quite magical," but extremely magical. I believe this stitching is made from creatia, the very substance, the substrate, of the Daedric Realms. Evergloam, I'd guess, given they seem to be made from the shadows themselves.
{{15453358-1-677:}}Verita would hate this, but I spread a drop of some of this oil on a rag I use for keeping my chair in good condition. I didn't think anything would happen, but then the rag darkened. I think this oil imbues whatever it contacts with shadows. '
{{15453358-1-676:}}Materials from Nocturnal's realm have strange effects here on Mundus. Darkling mana makes paint so black no light escapes from it and court fletched arrows never fly where they're aimed. It's not beyond reason to think these rivets have odd properties.
{{15453358-1-671:}}I have seen similar etching tools in the Nedic ruins of Hammerfell. Many Nede artisans salvaged tools left behind by the Dwemer of Volenfell after the Dwarves disappeared. They were far better than anything the Nedes could craft for themselves.
{{15453358-1-670:}}This is aetherium, one of the rarer forms of aetherial fragment. It is only found in the caverns beneath Skyrim. How glass that falls from the sky winds up underground, I could not say. The Dwemer powered many devices with crystals such as these.
{{15453358-1-673:}}The decorative element is actually quite functional. When I tap the pipes with a hammer, they ring like a bell. I suspect they were fitted to an armor plate or the casing of a mechanism. Something to do with Dwemer tonal magic, perhaps?
{{15453358-1-672:}}Not a piece of a machine, but a piece of armor. The length and the curvature are a good match for a muscular forearm, and the articulated section aligns with the wrist. I believe this is a Dwemer vambrace, but I'm afraid it's incomplete.
{{15453358-1-678:}}I am not a fan of poetry. Still, I admit that the poems stole my focus. I lost an entire days work in their pages. When I finished, I found a feather tucked into the last page that I do not remember seeing there before.
{{15453358-0-669:}}How lovely! I don't recognize the pattern, but I think these gloves are very old. This is wamasu-hide, magically cured. Wamasu are native to Black Marsh, but the design looks Elven. The Barsaebic Ayleids, perhaps?
{{15453358-0-685:}}A stunning find. The artistry demonstrated on the crystalline back of this hand mirror indicates it must have belonged to someone very important. The Ayleids weren't known for excessive vanity, but this would've been a precious keepsake.
{{15453358-0-684:}}This looks to be a lovely representation of the historic Imperial metalsmithing style. Note the ornate handle on the decanter. The care taken in its construction indicates the Imperial appreciation of winemaking goes back further than I once thought.
{{15453358-0-687:}}Take care with this map. The vellum is quite fragile. Such a beautiful depiction of the West Weald should be treasured. It does highlight the roads and other travel features. Perhaps this was meant for Colovian merchants?
{{15453358-0-686:}}This is not just any scabbard. Most Legion equipment, even historic armaments, tend toward practicality over ostentatious shows of rank. But the gilding on this scabbard suggests it was presented to its owner, perhaps as a commendation for their duty. King Rislav's crest is impressed in the metal. It's impossible to say if the king himself presented it, but certainly the recipient would have been a member of his court.
{{15453358-0-681:}}An exquisite likeness of an Aureal Daedra and the companion piece to a similar cameo of a Mazken Amalien is examining. The detail on this is remarkable, perhaps done with specialized tools. At the very least, would require a master craftsman's skill.
{{15453358-0-680:}}If I was a scholar at a lesser institution like Shad Astula I might presume this necklace clasping was crafted at a bucolic jewelery near Cyrodiil. Instead, as I am rigorous, I tested it and found a number of Daedric micro-etchings beneath my lens.
{{15453358-0-683:}}A cameo of a Dark Seducer, companion to a Golden Saint cameo being examined by Reginus. The detail is remarkable, almost as if the artisan made this piece at a larger scale to capture fine details and somehow reduced it in size again to fit on a necklace.
{{15453358-0-682:}}A yoke to a necklace of exquisite beauty, the style of crafting is something I've never quite seen before. It seems almost as if made by two pairs of hands, two different artisans, though its diminuative size makes that almost impossible.
{{15453358-0-689:}}I love the weight of a nice wool tapestry. And they last a long time. The pastoral scene is quite pleasant, but I can't tell exactly where it's supposed to depict.
{{15453358-0-688:}}Despite its age, the tapestry's linen has held up quite well. My research suggests the gold pattern comes from Breton make. At least, I assume it was gold. Difficult to tell through the years of dirt.
{{15453358-1-688:}}You should double-check your research as this is decidedly of Imperial crafting. Colovia, in particular. We've found tapestries of similar color and design across the region. This quality of weaving implies it hung in one of the local estates.
{{15453358-1-689:}}It may surprise you to hear that it doesn't depict a real location at all. I believe this is a scene from that old tale of The Gentle Prince. Those trees are exactly as Colovian retelling describes. The Prince wandered that forest looking for love.
{{15453358-1-680:}}An excellent observation. And quite true, these were done by a follower of a Prince with pretensions of normalcy. Or delusions. Hmm. These micro-runes also contain a surprising amount of magickal power.
{{15453358-1-681:}}This relic sat on my desk as I worked on other artifacts, and I would swear this thing is looking at me. Making strange faces. I wouldn't mention it in an official note I had not caught it trying to sneak a peek at my notes on its Dark Seducer twin.
{{15453358-1-682:}}One artisan clearly was an arrogant master of their craft. They took extravagant glee in showing off their skill, though the half of the yoke they've made seems somewhat sterile as a result.
{{15453358-1-683:}}After some odd comments from colleagues I took up outside my office after hours to read a book and listen. A strange sort of lilting song started up as dusk settled in. I confirmed it with my own eyes, this cameo sings when no one is around to observe it.
{{15453358-1-684:}}You'll note, Reginus, that this decanter is also quite large. It could easily have held several bottles of wine. This wasn't used for average meals, but large feasts and celebrations. It's a centerpiece of sorts.
{{15453358-1-685:}}While my own knowledge of ancient beauty practices is limited, I don't think this mirror was purely for superficial purposes. The carvings around the glass suggest a religious purpose to me. Perhaps a symbolic way of looking within oneself?
{{15453358-1-687:}}While the map does depict the West Weald, it is definitely not of Colovian make. Redguard maps frequently use this style of coloration and goatskin vellum. Merchants from Hammerfell could use this to navigate trade routes.
{{15453358-1-669:}}These are not gloves, Amalien. They are the inner lining for a pair of armored gauntlets. You can tell by the grommets and reinforced panels where armor plates would be attached. Yet I am not familiar with the style.
{{15453358-0-678:}}The inner cover proclaims this as a book of poetry to dazzle and capture the attention of others. Given the content, I doubt the attention is amorous. Unless the author believed that guts are a suitable gift for their beloved.
{{15453358-0-679:}}Our consulatations for the Circle regularly force me to look up variations on the word fascinating. Just to be sure my missives to the group don't sound repetitve. Daedric in origin, I would say this chain is mesmeric. Reginus?
{{15453358-0-670:}}Ah, an aetheric fragment! There are many varieties, of course. Welkynd stones, varla stones, skyshards, and more. All are very rare, and very valuable. I am not sure I know this particular type.
{{15453358-0-671:}}Interesting. These fine tools are gravers, picks used for etching fine designs in metal or stone. They're made of Dwarven metal, which makes sense.  You need a very hard metal to scratch another metal. What was made with them, I wonder?
{{15453358-0-672:}}Armor plate, articulated, made of dwarven metal. I think it must be a piece of a Dwemer animunculi, an animated machine used for labor or for war. Beyond that, I can't say.
{{15453358-0-673:}}I confess, I am not sure what to make of this. It appears to be a series of hoops or pipes made from dwarven metal, connected in the center by a piston-like mechanism. I suspect it is a decorative element or embellishment for a Dwemer animunculi.
{{15453358-0-674:}}This stitching is so light, so thin. Under normal circumstances I would assume it was used in creating a nobleman's wardrobe. Someone with money to spend who doesn't care about durability. But this substance seems quite magical. Amalien?
{{15453358-0-675:}}There are runes etched into the soft leather that look like others I've seen from the Hunting Grounds. I consulted Runes and Daedric Symbols by Zirpar Giralvel and discovered that these runes promise the wearer a successful hunt.
{{15453358-0-676:}}Gloamium is an odd material. It looks like ordinary silver and it melts like iron, but these rivets don't feel like either of those metals. They're cold to the touch and won't warm even after I set them down by the fire.
{{15453358-0-677:}}I read about an experiment conducted in Valenwood around the turn of the era to suspend a shadow in liquid. The experiment supposedly didn't succeed. I think you just discovered proof to contradicting that assumption.
{{15453358-0-696:}}You'd not believe how many it took to unearth an arch of this size. The meteoric iron used suggests Ayleid heritage. Possibly from a caved-in ruin? I know who'd like this one.
{{15453358-0-697:}}Strange to have a window that's riddled with cracks and that you can barely see though. But, oh, surely there's more to it than that! I'll sleep on this and have another look in the morning.
{{15453358-0-694:}}There are a lot of Welkynd Stones embedded in the material of this tree, but only on the branches. If I were to use these stones to store energy, I'd place them within reach. Perhaps the Ayleids didn't intend to use the stones' power.
{{15453358-0-695:}}The crystals embedded on this tree sculpture resemble some I've seen in Ayleid ruins off the Gold Coast. Surely it's welkynd, but I've never seen blue mist emit from them. No odor, but harmless.
{{15453358-0-692:}}Pottery is often repaired long after the piece has been fired, but these cracks that are filled with vibrant red look about as old as the Pitcher. Perhaps they were intentional. Given the artwork, the red could represent blood or wine.
{{15453358-0-693:}}This sculpture is enormous! I can't imagine how long it took to make. It seems odd to me that the Ayleids needed to cast such large tree sculptures. Trees are common enough in the environments surrounding some ruins.
{{15453358-0-690:}}Underneath the wear from age, this is quite a beautiful piece. I'll wager a guess it depicts one of the nicer Colovian estates. The ornate gateway in the Imperial style gives it away.
{{15453358-0-691:}}This fresco is fairly weathered and cracked. The artist clearly took inspiration from the rolling hills of the Gold Road. If you look closely, some of the leaves in the top left corner look like Bird Cherry leaves.
{{15453358-0-698:}}Clearly the Ayleids were trying to craft something of importance out of welkynd with this. A weapon to fight the rebellion? A shame they only discovered it near the cusp of their demise.
{{15453358-0-699:}}This is a sturdy find! Based on the texture and color of the stone, I can confidently say this slab originated in the Heartlands, near Cyrodiil. The River Niben is known for the quality of its basalt.
{{15453358-2-675:}}Verita interpreted the runes too literally. When etched into armor these would help them hunt victory on the battlefield. These runes are etched in a place where they are easy to conceal. These are thieves' leathers blessed for successful heists.
{{15453358-2-679:}}The Shivering Isles. Under magical examination the salt crystals appear to the same as those taken from the Enjaen Sea to the East of the realm's main landmass. I read a paper once noting that the seawater also held trace metals in the water. Riveting.
{{15453358-0-704:}}Now this is truly ancient! First Era, maybe? I can't place what this artefact would be used for. The crescent shape suggests some form of lunar worship, but the material is an unusual metal that's been treated to resemble stone. Very intriguing.
{{15453358-0-705:}}I wish my fingers were as clever as whoever carved this! The fine details on this metal brace indicate a level of diligence and attention to detail that even Ugron could appreciate. Looks to be part of something larger, but I'm not sure what.
{{15453358-0-706:}}Few relics survive the eons unscathed. This mirror is no exception, it's got cracks running all over the surface. Still, it would have been a lovely vanity item for some ancient lady's compact. I wonder when it was broken.
{{15453358-0-707:}}The cogs and gears contained inside this base rival anything created by the Dwemer. But the style of the exterior is distinctly Ayleid. It's a conundrum. I need to consult my books and see if the two cultures ever shared their crafting skills.
{{15453358-0-700:}}This looks to be an excellent example of an ancient blacksmithing component. The quality of this artifact is quite remarkable, especially given the fissures that seem to run across the exterior.
{{15453358-0-701:}}I haven't seen one of these in a while, good find! It's typical for blacksmiths to use decoctions of various metals in their work. The right mixture of ores can strengthen a forged item, much like finding the right balance of flavors in a cooked meal.
{{15453358-0-702:}}Leave it to the Ayleids to inscribe even their bracing with runes and enchantments. I can't make out what the markings may have imbued this artefact with. Maybe a blessing of strength or durability on whatever was forged here?
{{15453358-0-703:}}You really need my help with this? It's an anvil, obviously. Looks decently worn, but from use, rather than time. It's in the Ayleid style, which places it firmly from the First Era. Anything else?
{{15453358-0-708:}}Too large to be an earring, too small to be a key. The crystal at the end is clearly worn from touch, and it fits nicely in the hand. This was made to be used and handled, I just don't know what for.
{{15453358-1-708:}}Reginus was right on his second guess. It's a key or trigger of some kind. The teeth at the other end from the crystal certainly make it seem it should lock into place somehow. The Ayleids never cease to surprise me.
{{15453358-1-701:}}It's not just about strength, though many may believe so. The addition of differing ores and decoctions can also increase the flexibility of a tool. An important characteristic, unless you want your sword to shatter the first time you hit something.
{{15453358-1-700:}}You know, it's not uncommon for cracks like these to form on smithing stands that have been exposed to the enormous heat and pressure of sustained use. It's the sign of a successful smith and enviable craftsmanship.
{{15453358-1-703:}}Good start, but there's more here. The shape of the anvil itself is reminiscent of the Wild Elves. This smith may have had a penchant for imbuing their creations with nature magic. Magical farming tools, maybe?
{{15453358-1-702:}}It's the strangest thing. I've been studying the carvings on this bracing, and I still can't make it out. It's non-reactive to any spells I've tried on it. I need to dig deeper. There must be some ancient form of magicka I've overlooked!
{{15453358-1-705:}}Reginus wanted me to look at this one. The craftsmanship is apparent, even with age. Looks to me like a miniature carved pillar. It could have something to do with Ayleid tombs or burial customs. More study is needed.
{{15453358-1-704:}}I practically had to pry this out of Reginus's hands. But it was worth it. There are some notches on the back that suggest this item wasn't an object of worship itself, but part of a larger piece. I suspect it may be a sculpture or art piece.
{{15453358-1-707:}}I've never seen Ugron so grumpy as when I noticed the tiny metal keys hidden beneath the gears. They're aligned for the gears to hit them, but I'm not sure what will happen when they do. We're still missing something.
{{15453358-1-706:}}Perhaps the shattering was intentional? A meditation on the perils of vanity and selfishness? There's something about this mirror that doesn't sit right with me. It's cracked, but how have all the pieces stayed together over the years?

{{20958740-0-8780:}}An investigator?
{{20958740-0-8787:}}Why are you interested in crystaljack venom?
{{20958740-0-8789:}}What do you need me to do?
{{20958740-0-8788:}}Can you tell me anything about this ritual?
{{20958740-1-8884:}}I'll go speak with the Crow. Good luck, Nahlia.
{{20958740-0-8769:}}What kind of help do you need?
{{20958740-0-8765:}}What are you trying to get from inside the ruins?
{{20958740-0-8767:}}What do you want me to do?
{{20958740-0-8766:}}What do you need from me?
{{20958740-0-8761:}}So you were invited to this auction?
{{20958740-0-8763:}}You're a vampire?
{{20958740-0-8762:}}What's so important about this keep?
{{20958740-1-8914:}}I'll convince your facets to return to you.
{{20958740-0-8841:}}I need more details, legionary.
{{20958740-0-8746:}}What do you think the Recollection's looking for?
{{20958740-0-8745:}}Could Vashabar's Wood Elves be involved with the Recollection?
{{20958740-0-8744:}}What was that about the threads of fate?
{{20958740-0-8749:}}So what do you suggest?
{{20958740-0-8748:}}What do you mean?
{{20958740-1-8788:}}I'll stop Spinner Urthrendir and burn the mushrooms.
{{20958740-1-8771:}}I'll accompany Legionary Calvo into the fort and ring the warning signal for you.
{{20958740-1-8770:}}I'll search Fyrelight Cave for your stolen dowry.
{{20958740-1-8773:}}I'll help you find a way to calm the warring Goblins.
{{20958740-1-8778:}}I'll help Votary Nahlia assess this magical anomaly.
{{20958740-0-8896:}}Who's Pim?
{{20958740-0-8895:}}What do you need me to do?
{{20958740-0-8899:}}Do you think you're in danger, too?
{{20958740-0-8917:}}All right. Tell me about your orders.
{{20958740-0-8914:}}You fractured your personality?
{{20958740-0-8915:}}The final wing is your wing?
{{20958740-0-8913:}}Sorry to hear that. How can I help?
{{20958740-0-8910:}}All right. Give me the orders.
{{20958740-0-8918:}}So what do I need to do?
{{20958740-1-8847:}}I'll talk to <<1>>.
{{20958740-1-8759:}}I'll help you find your research and the Emblem.
{{20958740-1-8899:}}I'll help you find the remaining Scarlets.
{{20958740-1-8895:}}All right. I'll help fight off a Mirrormoor incursion.
{{20958740-1-8896:}}I'll go find Pim and see if I can help her.
{{20958740-1-8751:}}All right, I'll place the relics and cast the spell. Where do I need to go?
{{20958740-1-8750:}}All right. I'll go with you to Apocrypha and use the Skein of Secrets.
{{20958740-1-8756:}}All right. I'll help you find the missing Legion cohort.
{{20958740-1-8905:}}I'll help you stop Xoryn and secure the arcane knot in the null arca.
{{20958740-1-8780:}}I'll speak with Mizzik Thunderboots.
{{20958740-1-8781:}}I can help Tribune Alea. Where can I find her?
{{20958740-1-8782:}}I'll help the people of Leftwheal.
{{20958740-0-8753:}}What's the favor? And why won't your fathers let you wed?
{{20958740-1-8904:}}I will look for Trapper Marcien.
{{20958740-1-8908:}}I'll talk to Neletai.
{{20958740-0-8794:}}What exactly do you need me to do?
{{20958740-0-8795:}}What kind of dangers do you want me to look for?
{{20958740-0-8796:}}This thing defeated a squad of legionaries?
{{20958740-0-8797:}}What exactly are you asking me to do?
{{20958740-0-8790:}}Tell me about these high-quality tools.
{{20958740-0-8792:}}Why are you interest in old Reachfolk trinkets?
{{20958740-0-8793:}}What sort of calamitous error?
{{20958740-0-8798:}}Where can I find Hessedaz the Baleful?
{{20958740-0-8799:}}Tell me about this lead.
{{20958740-0-8778:}}Is the Mages Guild keeping this a secret?
{{20958740-0-8773:}}If warring Goblins are so dangerous, why not let the hunters handle it?
{{20958740-0-8770:}}Where did the brigand run off to?
{{20958740-0-8771:}}What kind of help are you looking for?
{{20958740-1-8787:}}All right. I'll gather the crystaljack venom crystals from Legion's Rest.
{{20958740-1-8789:}}All right. I'll help fight off a Mirrormoor incursion.
{{20958740-0-8747:}}The Staff of Many Paths? Didn't Shardmarshal Vargas give that to Nantharion at Hoperoot?
{{20958740-0-8758:}}New forest?
{{20958740-0-8759:}}What's the Emblem of the Last King?
{{20958740-0-8750:}}Apocrypha's a pretty big place. How will we find her?
{{20958740-0-8751:}}That's it? Just place the three relics in specific locations?
{{20958740-0-8756:}}If you command the cohort, why weren't you here with them?
{{20958740-0-8757:}}What do you want me to do?
{{20958740-1-8797:}}I'll put down the tharrikers and destroy the goblins' training supplies.
{{20958740-1-8796:}}I'll destroy Stri the Fate-Eater and recover the Legion armaments.
{{20958740-1-8795:}}All right. I'll investigate Nonungalo and record my findings in this journal.
{{20958740-1-8844:}}I'll go to Beragon's townhouse and see what he has to say.
{{20958740-1-8762:}}I'll join in Feldagard Keep's defense. How do we start?
{{20958740-1-8763:}}I'll help you stop Balandrus and his gang of vampires in Sutch.
{{20958740-1-8761:}}I'll help you investigate the auction at the Valente Vineyards and Winery.
{{20958740-1-8766:}}I'll help stop their rituals and rescue the remaining townsfolk.
{{20958740-1-8767:}}I'll help you find Lazen and recover the stolen wine.
{{20958740-1-8765:}}I'll help you gather Aetherial shards from the ruins.
{{20958740-1-8769:}}All right, I'll help you stop the ritual.
{{20958740-0-8868:}}Do you have proof that your father was murdered?
{{20958740-0-8887:}}Where's Leramil now?
{{20958740-0-8882:}}Meaning?
{{20958740-0-8888:}}What do you need me to do?
{{20958740-1-8746:}}I'll help you look into the Recollection's plans. Where do we start?
{{20958740-1-8790:}}I'll return with any tool packs I find at the Haldain Lumber Camp.
{{20958740-0-8884:}}There seems to be a good deal still to discover.
{{20958740-1-8798:}}I'll deal with Hessedaz the Baleful and recharge the sentry runes.
{{20958740-0-8905:}}If the arcane knot is so unstable, why do you want it?
{{20958740-0-8904:}}What do you need me to do?
{{20958740-0-8907:}}I should bring this piece of Living Glass to Keshargo.
{{20958740-0-8906:}}I should give this bottle to Keshargo. Maybe he knows what to do with it.
{{20958740-0-8909:}}Any idea where I can find your squadron?
{{20958740-0-8908:}}Do you know who attacked you?
{{20958740-0-8844:}}Informative as always, Caepio. Anything else?
{{20958740-0-8845:}}You're a vampire, too?
{{20958740-0-8846:}}What nice Wood Elf?
{{20958740-0-8847:}}What do you need me to do?
{{20958740-1-8800:}}I'll deal with Oakenclaw and put up the warning bulletins.
{{20958740-1-8868:}}I'll help you investigate the suspicious deaths in Ontus.
{{20958740-0-8800:}}And that's bad?
{{20958740-1-8841:}}All right. I'll go talk to Beragon at his townhouse in Skingrad.
{{20958740-1-8846:}}I'll find Beragon and see how I can help.
{{20958740-1-8845:}}I'll help you stop Balandrus and his gang of vampires in Sutch.
{{20958740-1-8909:}}I'll go to Fort Hastrel and find out what became of your squad.
{{20958740-1-8748:}}All right. Let's go stop Ithelia.
{{20958740-1-8749:}}All right. I'll accompany you and Leramil to examine this instability.
{{20958740-1-8744:}}I'll help you deal with the threat of Ithelia. Where do we begin?
{{20958740-1-8745:}}I'll help you learn more about the wildburn seed.
{{20958740-1-8747:}}I'll help you find King Nantharion and stop him.
{{20958740-1-8887:}}All right, I'll meet Learmil at your townhouse in Skingrad, Beragon.
{{20958740-1-8882:}}I'll return to your townhouse and speak to Leramil.
{{20958740-1-8888:}}I'll go find <<1>>.
{{20958740-1-8793:}}I can travel to Fort Colovia and burn the crates.
{{20958740-1-8913:}}I'll help you find the count's pet bear.
{{20958740-1-8792:}}All right. I'll gather the Reachfolk trinkets from Varen's Watch.
{{20958740-1-8918:}}All right, I'll go to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and talk to Leramil.
{{20958740-1-8915:}}Let's get started.
{{20958740-1-8758:}}I'll help you rescue the villagers and search for Greenspeaker Sorilen.
{{20958740-1-8753:}}I can do that. I'll find Agawen Ciiril and let her know your plans.
{{20958740-1-8799:}}I'll dispatch the Recollection leaders and gather any information I can find.
{{20958740-1-8794:}}I'll go to Fyrelight Cave and investigate the tharriker.
{{20958740-1-8757:}}I'll enter the inn and find the source of this disturbance.
{{20958740-1-8917:}}I'll go talk to Beragon.
{{20958740-1-8910:}}I'll go see what kind of help Beragon requires.
{{55049764-8-16035:}}My father's letter said he was planning to question Ghrakug at the Stonechip, Ranch Overseer Merrarq, and Quarry Boss Laurina. Let's start where he left off and talk to them. \n\nThen, check my father's office. I … I haven't been able do that yet.
{{55049764-7-15850:}}All this waiting and for what? A riddle? It's absurd. The sooner you and Mizzik solve this riddle the sooner our family can move on from this nonsense. To think we haven't even had a chance to celebrate Uriel's return.
{{55049764-7-15857:}}You're here to help, right? Those bandits came out of nowhere. We barely escaped. But you should talk to the captain.
{{55049764-7-15856:}}This is Elenglynn, an Ayleid ruin. I expected to find the Recollection here, as they have been searching similar ruins throughout the area. They did not disappoint.\n\nI sense an aura of Daedric power, as well. Perhaps that aura drew them here.
{{55049764-4-16017:}}Abolisher survived? I admit I was not very optimistic about our chances. Let us make our exit while we can—and hope that we shall not need the relics again.
{{55049764-7-16002:}}Stay alert. We have no idea what we're going to encounter in here.
{{55049764-7-16005:}}Sorilen was always good at sneaking around. She would have made an excellent scout if she hadn't become a greenspeaker. Still, how she avoided all these Recollection fanatics is beyond me.\n\nWell, let's talk to her and see what she wanted to show me.
{{55049764-7-16009:}}I don't see any sign of Vargas or Ithelia here, but that manifestation looks like a point where you could use Abolisher. Try it and see what happens.
{{55049764-4-16010:}}Use the Echonir to reveal the memory here, proxy. It must be relevant to our current situation.
{{55049764-11-16055:}}Best of days to you, traveler. I hope you've come to Vashabar in good mood.
{{55049764-14-15991:}}The more I learn about the Recollection, the less I understand their motives and intentions. It's all secrets within secrets.
{{55049764-4-16013:}}Ayleid ruins fascinate me. They're testaments to my people's history.
{{55049764-11-16056:}}Welcome! We have an incredible variety of beers, wines, ales, and meads. Let's find something that suits your taste.
{{55049764-10-16248:}}Let us see what you make of my little games. The best games are ones that others don't know they are playing. \n\nMakes for much more bubbly responses when they discover the joyful tricks we played on them!
{{55049764-10-16242:}}Mortal. Let us dispense with pleasantries. You are here to master Scribing. To amplify the power of the altar, and walk in the footsteps of the Archmagus Ulfsild.\n\nIn short, her inheritor. Do I have that right?
{{55049764-9-16184:}}I've been dying to ask you about your trial. Please tell me the Dragon gave you some sort of riddle to solve. I'm right here if you need me.
{{55049764-8-15991:}}One diplomatic incident averted. So far, so good.\n\nGo ahead and speak with the king, friend. Tell him about the threat the Recollection poses to Vashabar. And about the corrupted seeds.
{{55049764-8-15993:}}I must warn you, traveler, the writing contained in the journal is blasphemous. Still, it provides some insight as to how the other necromancers were killed and what we must do to stop the ritual. \n\nArkay watch over us, this will not be easy.
{{55049764-14-16017:}}Another trap! I have no idea if Ithelia is aware of us, but Shardmarshal Vargas certainly is. I doubt she plans to release us any time soon … if ever.\n\nAt least the Echonir has something to show us. Let us see what we can learn from this memory.
{{55049764-29-15960:}}It's obvious there was trouble here. Tham's tattered cloak, his bloodied sword. And the note he managed to leave for me. Clever of him to tell me where to find the surviving townsfolk without alerting the vampires.
{{55049764-10-15782:}}That was Shardmarshal Vargas down there, ordering these Recollection cultists like she did the Daedric troops at Feldagard Keep.\n\nAt least we took that blade from her. We need to find out what she's doing here.
{{55049764-10-15785:}}Torvesard? Were you expecting him, friend? He did help us in the end, against Peryite and Vaermina the last time we were in Apocrypha.\n\nMaybe he's had another change of heart? It appears he only does want to talk to you.
{{55049764-18-15802:}}We must be getting close to the source of Ithelia's power. Look how much of the Mythos has … changed.
{{55049764-6-16130:}}You've got the crystal? Put it on the altar and let's see what happens.
{{55049764-22-15960:}}Let's find Grivier's trail and follow it.
{{55049764-7-16248:}}How are you here, Not-Ulfsild? Surely this wasn't Nahlia's doing. You're meant to be helping the fragments of a lost soul make their way back to Suran.\n\nOh! Is this a trick of your own? Cleverly done! Now go on, and let Nahlia be your guide.
{{55049764-7-16247:}}I had no idea Elic's father was even sick. We're old friends, so I'm eager to help however we can.\n\nDid the Netch explain how I'm going to help you? Back to where we began, with portals?
{{55049764-7-16242:}}Which riddles will you solve? Which ones will you seek help to solve?\n\nChoices made are so instructive, so … revealing. Don't you agree?
{{55049764-38-15960:}}What Balandrus and his gang have done to Sutch … he's really trying to make a name for himself as the Terror of the Weald.
{{55049764-16-15779:}}Let's go, mortal. Those instabilities won't investigate themselves.
{{55049764-16-15778:}}Go through the portal, proxy. I need a moment with Curate Gadayn. We shall follow in due course.
{{55049764-28-15793:}}Death hounds are vampiric creatures. What are they doing sniffing around a vineyard when there's bound to be far more blood at the manor?
{{55049764-3-16023:}}You're going to find Master Grander's stolen goods? Wonderful! If you make quick work of it, I should be able to have his evening clothes properly pressed in time for dinner in Skingrad.
{{55049764-3-16021:}}I sense this realm will not last much longer. The binds of reality have begun to fray.\n\nHurry, mortal. Gather the lute berries and I will open a way out of this place.
{{55049764-3-16020:}}I sense the knot in the threads of fate has untangled, proxy. This threat to our reality has passed. Should I assume you are responsible? Tell me what occurred within the Outcast Inn.
{{55049764-12-15856:}}Welcome, proxy. I searched Tamriel for signs of Torvesard or his Prince to no avail—until now. Strange disturbances and disorder trouble this land, occurrences that threaten West Weald and all of Nirn.\n\nBut through them, we will find her.
{{55049764-29-16043:}}If Feldagard Keep falls, so does the Colovian Highlands. We must defend it at all costs.
{{55049764-4-16178:}}The fawn is safe. My strength returned. And you have had a moment, I hope, to reflect on power and its wise application.
{{55049764-4-16170:}}You've taken to this well, your early steps to master Scribing. But from here, I must take my leave. Return to the Scholarium.\n\nUlfsild, I believe, wanted her inheritor to walk this path alone.
{{55049764-7-15851:}}I hope to put this nonsense to rest. I only wish to start making up for my long absence. I do hope the investigation is wrapped up with haste.
{{55049764-21-15983:}}We're standing in a forest that grew overnight. Pointing out that the Wood Elves of Vashabar occupy land that belongs to West Weald isn't an accusation. It's a simple statement of fact!\n\nAh, never mind. You talk to her. Find out about that seed.
{{55049764-8-15806:}}Who's that vampire you came in with? He looks so familiar.
{{55049764-8-15802:}}Let us enter Ithelia's prison and finish this once and for all. Use the portal.
{{55049764-8-15800:}}While you speak with the family members, Mizzik will observe with his keen senses and fine-tuned whiskers. No deception, however small, will escape this one.
{{55049764-21-15960:}}I was a tracker long before Balandrus inflicted me with that damn curse. That trail is as clear as day. Group of folks left the bank and headed southwest, trying to be quiet.\n\nLet's keep moving.
{{55049764-0-15788:}}Heard that you did some excellent work for us recently. I knew we could count on you.
{{55049764-0-15780:}}Mahkkin should not gloat, but Ruri has always treated this one rudely. And besides, he could have gotten all of us killed with his scheming.
{{55049764-0-15781:}}Well, it's over. I've got the shards, and I didn't get killed or press-ganged into becoming a necromancer.\n\nI didn't even learn a lesson on procrastinating because everything worked out. Like it always does.
{{55049764-0-15782:}}Consider your temporary commission suspended, comrade. Though I'd love to have you permanently assigned to my cohort.\n\nI plan to continue to look into the Recollection and Shardmarshal Vargas. I hear there's a Wood Elf in Skingrad doing the same.
{{55049764-0-15785:}}Beragon and I will be here if you need us.
{{55049764-0-15786:}}Back to Oblivion? Well, in for an acorn, in for an oak. I'm with you, friend!
{{55049764-2-16105:}}This level of destruction and twisted magics. What could have done this?
{{55049764-2-16104:}}A tragic day for those who call Leftwheal home.
{{55049764-2-16107:}}What were those things? I've never seen anything like them before.
{{55049764-2-16106:}}Please, I need a moment to catch my breath. This is all too much.
{{55049764-5-15864:}}Fate's guidance is not clear to me at the moment. Proceed as you are inclined to, proxy. No doubt the requirements of fate will make themselves known soon enough.
{{55049764-11-16205:}}Please, find Naku and bring him to us quickly. Something about all this puts a fire of worry in my gut.
{{55049764-0-16253:}}I see you are still at the beck and call of the lying Prince of Fate. I do not seek to be your enemy, mortal. Before we irreversibly cross a threshold from which there is no return, I would reach an understanding between us.
{{55049764-0-16251:}}You are not the same lighthearted presence I met in the darkness, but I feel comforted all the same.
{{55049764-0-16250:}}Thank you again, stranger.\n\nI hope I look all right. I didn't anticipate meeting my father-in-law today.
{{55049764-0-16257:}}Head to Count Calantius's office in Skingrad. It's close to the chapel.
{{55049764-0-16256:}}The ally of Skingrad and the hero of West Weald! So good to see you again, adventurer! Well, unless of course, you're here to tell us about another disaster, invasion, or catastrophe.\n\nIf that's the case, please talk to Tribune Alea.
{{55049764-0-16255:}}I wonder how long it took Ulfsild and the Gryphon to design these animated armors. We've got constructs aplenty, somewhat like these? \n\nBut I've never seen anything quite like them. I can't wait for our best adepts to study them.
{{55049764-0-16254:}}You're brave, adventurer. I wouldn't provoke the Princes unless I had no other choice. \n\nBut this is the Gryphon's task, not mine. In my own way, I'm used to disagreeing with him.
{{55049764-3-16315:}}Incredible! This must be the very heart of Ithelia's domain. Do you think we're the first mortals to ever see this place? We might definitely be the last, too. We'd better get down there.
{{55049764-0-15904:}}I came here to find work, but the locals are so high-handed I'm not sure I'll ever fit in.
{{55049764-12-16035:}}I hope my father can rest easier now. I finished what he started and brought the murderers to justice. I'll see them get whatever punishment the magistrate deems acceptable, whether life in a dungeon or the executioner's blade.\n\nThanks again, deputy.
{{55049764-8-16129:}}You know, I'd like to find a way to help out around here. Everyone's got their assignments, and they're all just telling me to stay out of the way!\n\nI do that well enough, but I'd like to do more.
{{55049764-1-16222:}}Mercenary, I have more orders from Tribune Alea.
{{55049764-1-16221:}}On the path to ally with the Dragon you must choose your words carefully.\n\nIf she asks if you are my inheritor, do not agree or disagree. Insist upon taking her trial.
{{55049764-11-16269:}}Mortal. Greetings and defiance. My companion has clearly adopted you. But then he's always seen the best in people.\n\nWhy should I stay my claws?
{{55049764-11-16266:}}The Gryphon has always been quick to the point. Righting wrongs and bringing you along to do it. Look at him go. \n\nStill shivering in his feathers and he's almost back to his old self!
{{55049764-11-16264:}}Ugh, I'm such a screaming ninny when I panic. I suppose you saw that whole debacle? \n\nIt's embarrassing enough for me to witness my own base emotions, let alone anyone else. I've got to pull myself together. Literally.
{{55049764-2-16315:}}Come on, friend! Ithelia is already in the Loom. We must get past Shardmarshal Vargas before it's too late!
{{55049764-2-16316:}}Attack, comrade! We can defeat the shardmarshal together!
{{55049764-2-16317:}}Shardmarshal Vargas hopes to delay us long enough for Ithelia to finish her work with the Loom. We must defeat Vargas as quickly as we can!
{{55049764-9-16035:}}You examined the newest grave markers. Give me your impressions, deputy.
{{55049764-5-16219:}}Traveler. Hmm. It's been some time since we've had a new leaf blow into the Wilderhall.
{{55049764-5-16217:}}If you find my squadron, tell them that Captain Dartorius sent you. Order them to stay put at Fort Hastrel and wait for me to join them. I'll stay here until you tell me it's safe.\n\nIf you run into Ulrath, be careful. He's a cold-blooded killer!
{{55049764-5-16210:}}That creature held the arcane knot? How much of its power was its own? \n\nIt does not matter. The knot is out now. When you're ready, we should take it from this place. The null arca is the only thing that can keep it stable.
{{55049764-5-16211:}}Talk to Keshargo over there. I'm busy. \n\nThat fool Xoryn may have knocked my null arca out of alignment when he attacked. It took me a century to get this far with the arca. I do not want to start over.
{{55049764-12-15971:}}I spent a lot of time staring at this welkynd stone the last time I was here. Our party's mage was sure it controlled the vault door to the south … somehow.\n\nLet's look at those notes. Maybe the Recollection got closer to solving it than I did.
{{55049764-12-15973:}}Since I have some familiarity with the area, I'll meet you in the Telvanni Peninsula.
{{55049764-12-15972:}}My tasks never end! I'll mark your map. The locations where you need to place the relics are in West Weald, the Telvanni Peninsula, and Apocrypha.\n\nLook for one of your allies when you get to each spot. And make sure to bring the scroll and relics!
{{55049764-0-16042:}}Maybe I can blame all this on Raxalee. No one will accept the word of a lizard over that of a true Colovian.
{{55049764-0-16043:}}Let's keep news about Abolisher between us until we're back in Skingrad. I don't want thieves or Recollection agents to get any ideas while I'm traveling.\n\nReturn to Beragon's townhouse as soon as you can. I have a feeling this is far from over.
{{55049764-0-16041:}}I won't face the magistrate's justice alone. Oh no. I'll tell them exactly how Carvain was involved. How he hired the mercenaries, told the alchemist to kill the healer and the constable—everything!
{{55049764-0-16045:}}The Blade, the Lamp, and the Skein countered Ithelia's power in ancient times. I think they can do so again.\n\nYou and Beragon are fated to seek the Skein of Secrets in Niryastare. I have my own tasks and shall find you when it is time to finish this.
{{55049764-6-15993:}}Hesitation will not serve us now. Enter Nonungalo, traveler. I will be along after I consecrate the corpse. According to Arkay, mortality should be honored in all its forms, even when the deceased is a necromancer.
{{55049764-6-15991:}}I spotted the seed in a clearing up the hill. It looked … I don't know, ready to burst or something! Go burn it. But watch yourself. There are more Recollection around.\n\nWe'll stay here and hold off any that try to pass.
{{55049764-6-15998:}}The people of West Weald owe you a great debt—as does the One Who Knows. I suspect your actions here are the only reason we still have a chance to avert disaster. Conclude your business with Beragon, proxy. The next battle awaits.
{{55049764-28-15960:}}The Sutch Depository is across from the tavern.\n\nBalandrus always had ambitions. But to become the Terror of the Weald … I saw all the signs but didn't want to believe he was capable of such atrocities. Still, I left at the first opportunity.
{{55049764-7-15778:}}Leave me, proxy. Talk to Scruut.
{{55049764-7-15779:}}Obviously, we're going to need something connected to Ithelia!\n\nI spotted a Primordial Shattered Titan in the ruins of Ceyond while I was scouting instabilities. Retrieve a fragment of that ancient Daedra. We can use it to create the relic.
{{55049764-15-15779:}}I can clearly see the frayed and shredded threads of fate surrounding that mortal. Very peculiar. Go talk to it.\n\nI'd do it, but most mortals react poorly to all my beautiful eyes and tentacles.
{{55049764-24-15983:}}The Wood Elf mentioned a strange seed the two of you found at Ostumir. If that can explain how that new forest grew up so quickly, we should look into that. \n\nTalk to Beragon and see if he knows anyone who might be able to tell us more.
{{55049764-7-16162:}}I've been watching these Goblins for a while. They're worried. And worried Goblins can be unpredictable. \n\nI haven't seen their shaman either. Let's look around. Hopefully my theory is wrong and everything is fine here.
{{55049764-7-16163:}}This is a fine way to wake after centuries of restless slumber! Did she send you? \n\nYou're not at all what I was promised. It wasn't enough to break in, you had to smash the altar too?
{{55049764-5-16058:}}Ah, a visitor. Normally I'd welcome a chance to talk about the future of the Weald, but this isn't the best time. \n\nOur leader … well. We've had a setback recently.
{{55049764-5-16054:}}Pod in hand. Thank Y'ffre! \n\nLet's get out of here so you can help Clen.
{{55049764-5-16055:}}We've got it. Let's get out of here so you can head for the ritual site. Laeni needs her offering as well.
{{55049764-5-16056:}}Singer be praised, you're back. What did they say?
{{55049764-5-16057:}}Y'ffre's knees, a stranger. Welcome. What can this old greenspeaker do for you?
{{55049764-5-16051:}}Don't dawdle while carrying out my orders. We don't have much time before the Daedra regroup and attack.\n\nGet going, mercenary!
{{55049764-18-15971:}}That's Niryastare over there … surrounded by a Recollection stockade. I guess it's nice to know I correctly interpreted the map we found in Hoperoot. But it does pose a problem.
{{55049764-5-16264:}}Let's make this quick, I want to get out of here.\n\nThere's only one facet left. I know which one it is now, and she's not going to be easy to capture.
{{55049764-11-15985:}}Go on. See if you can use Abolisher to open a portal. We need to get moving again!
{{55049764-11-15983:}}I'm pretty sure we didn't miss Nantharion on the way up. That means he must be above us in this tree-fort … assuming the Recollection hasn't taken him somewhere else already.\n\nOr simply killed him.
{{55049764-11-15981:}}The Skein marks another use of the Staff of Many Paths at Fort Dirich. It's an old Imperial ruin, abandoned for centuries. With any luck, it will take Nantharion some time to plant his wildburn seeds. Maybe this time we can catch him in the act!
{{55049764-4-16249:}}Are you a healer with the clinic? Please. We came as soon as we heard. I need my father to know I made the journey. The way I last spoke to him … it can't be the last time. It can't.\n\nI never wanted him to pass from this world alone.
{{55049764-11-16182:}}Nahlia's opened up quite a lot recently. I can't tell if it's because of the riddles, the work in the Scholarium at large, or because of you.\n\nWhatever the reason, I'm glad to see her in such high spirits. What can I do for you?
{{55049764-4-16247:}}About to power up the altar again, are you? Don't let me stand in your way!
{{55049764-2-16291:}}Watch your back in there. Those creatures are faster than they look.
{{55049764-2-16293:}}I overheard you talking with the baroness. Be careful in there. I appreciate what you're doing, but we won't be able to save you if things get worse.
{{55049764-2-16292:}}You've come to support us? Very well. Go on through the front gates and may the Divines be with you.
{{55049764-2-16294:}}You're going in there yourself? For the sake of all we've lost, I pray this city must not lose more.
{{55049764-5-16178:}}Seek the fawn and the hunter in a southern Auridon cavern. Del's Claim, I believe it is called today.\n\nRestore this ill-used power, and I will lend my strength to yours. A signpost on your path to master Scribing.
{{55049764-5-15778:}}The relics shall balance the energy we need to complete the ritual. Place them around the fragment.
{{55049764-5-15779:}}Mortals die. That's literally the meaning of the word. I'll never understand your transient emotions. Whatever. We all face nonexistence if we don't do something about Ithelia and the reality tears. \n\nYou secured the fragment?
{{55049764-5-15772:}}Securing four crates of Blue Aedral should be enough to keep our vineyard afloat. If we act fast, we might even find out how they knew to ambush us here. We traveled in secret, you know.\n\nAnd let's look for Lazen. I'd hate it if he were harmed.
{{55049764-14-16204:}}Caelum Vineyard isn't much more than a ruin these days. But everything goes back to that place, that night. I have a feeling Marcan Caelum is waiting for us there.\n\nWe'll talk more at the vineyard.
{{55049764-17-16269:}}The struggle for justice never ends, mortal. Always be prepared to fight. To defend what matters most to you.
{{55049764-18-16021:}}An odd feeling—hatred and dread without knowing why. But I know that lamp somehow.\n\nOnce you pick up the lamp, I can study it. Maybe it will help me remember.
{{55049764-6-15985:}}Now that we know what Vargas can do, I'll stand watch. We need to see what that memory wants to tell us.\n\nGo ahead, comrade. Use the Echonir.
{{55049764-12-15786:}}Now that all of the relics have been restored, we should meet up with Leramil and Scruut back at my townhouse.
{{55049764-12-15782:}}I want to find my legionaries and the estate staff. They have to be down here somewhere. Let's push forward and see what lies ahead.
{{55049764-1-16147:}}I feel … cold. My skin … it's pale. Please, tell me this isn't happening.\n\nTell me I'm not becoming … one of them.
{{55049764-1-16144:}}Your Ithelia, does she not sense it? The Ithelia of this path, my Prince, has lost herself. She has become the monster that Hermaeus Mora foresaw. If she cannot regain control, this reality is finished.\n\nWhy does a mortal walk beside an Ithelia?
{{55049764-15-15983:}}The Recollection was waiting for us. If Beragon hadn't spotted them, their ambush would have been flawless. Beragon's good in my book. Those Wood Elves got the drop on me, but he saved my sorry arse.\n\nDeal with the seed. We'll hold off any others.
{{55049764-23-15800:}}You heard the gardener, retrieve the herbs!
{{55049764-11-15800:}}A glittering secret? Certainly the fortune. Loyal paws? Must mean Betu. But still, clarity eludes this one. How can a dog hide a secret? There must be something this one is missing.
{{55049764-28-16266:}}Any friend of the Gryphon's is a friend of mine!
{{55049764-6-16184:}}And here I was worried that I'd be finding you at a dead end. What did Ulfsild's echo have to say?
{{55049764-3-16276:}}I still can't believe it. We're Ulfsild's legacy. You, me. And if I have anything to say about it, anyone that wants to learn the art of Scribing.
{{55049764-3-16274:}}Look, I'm sure your friend has a reasonable explanation for everything. But you can't blame Elelorn for thinking she bears a striking resemblance to one of our prisoners.
{{55049764-3-16275:}}Do you know this criminal? She's nothing but trouble!
{{55049764-4-16039:}}Constable Ulbren was a good friend and Yabren's like a daughter to me. If there's anything else I can do to help, let me know.
{{55049764-2-15971:}}It's just like we saw at Hoperoot—the Echonir has something to show us. Go on, friend. Let's see what it reveals!
{{55049764-2-15973:}}Strange … I feel like I just awakened from a deep sleep and the fragments of a dream are fading like mist off the morning dew.\n\nBut is that Gadayn? I thought for sure we had lost him!
{{55049764-2-15972:}}What just happened? I heard my master's voice, and then … something went away. It's right there, on the tip of my tentacle … and now it's gone!\n\nHey, how did Gadayn get back here?
{{55049764-2-15975:}}A map that shows you exactly where to find Ithelia's power? That sounds remarkably useful. Who came up with that, I wonder.\n\nGo ahead and try it, comrade. I want to see how this Skein thing works.
{{55049764-2-15977:}}Did <<1>> find you and bring you out here? She's such a good girl!
{{55049764-2-15976:}}You there, are you familiar with the local terrain? If so, I could use your help.\n\nMy husband and I, we came to this godsforsaken land to get away from the clamor of city life. But I fear my poor <<1>> may have gotten into a spot of trouble.
{{55049764-2-15978:}}<<<1>> makes a sad sound as she looks to the north.>
{{55049764-6-16276:}}Is this where she spent her final years? It's beautiful.
{{55049764-3-16130:}}I've been a knight in the Order for years, traveler, and I've never heard of anything like this. \n\nA lost art of shaping magic, an ancient library, and these Luminaries. This is incredible!
{{55049764-0-15987:}}I have a feeling this is the start of a long and dangerous journey. Take care of any business you have here in Skingrad while you can, friend. I'll meet you at Wendir.
{{55049764-0-15984:}}We stopped Nantharion and prevented a massive wildburn that would have destroyed the rest of West Weald. But Ithelia and Shardmarshal Vargas got away. Let's go back to my townhouse and figure out where we stand.
{{55049764-0-15985:}}I may never get used to fighting Daedra and magic-users, but at least we put an end to Nantharion and his plot to destroy West Weald. That should finish the Recollection.\n\nNow is it too much to hope that Ithelia will take her power and just go away?
{{55049764-0-15982:}}Hoperoot lies to the north of Vashabar, just before you enter the devastated region. I'll be there, supervising the establishment of our next settlement.\n\nGood luck to you, adventurer.
{{55049764-0-15983:}}I need to tell Count Calantius about Nantharion and the Recollection. We need to make sure the West Weald Legion's ready for Nantharion's next move, whatever it is.\n\nGo on back to Beragon's townhouse, comrade. I'm sure I'll see you soon.
{{55049764-0-15980:}}Here, I'll mark your map. I met the Wood Elves with the covered cart in the hills east of Leftwheal. If you find more of these corrupted seeds, burn them!\n\nAnd don't worry. I'll destroy the one you gave me after I finish examining it.
{{55049764-0-15981:}}We stopped Nantharion and prevented a massive wildburn that would have destroyed the rest of West Weald. But Ithelia and Shardmarshal Vargas got away. Let's go back to my townhouse and figure out where we stand.
{{55049764-0-15988:}}Maerenah looks … different. But if you're not with the vampires, does it mean it's safe out there? And did you see my husband, Grivier? He hasn't returned from his last excursion.
{{55049764-0-15989:}}Why are you helping Maerenah? She's one of them!\n\nAnd Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald … he told me he returned to Sutch because of her. This is all her fault!
{{55049764-24-16043:}}We need to take stock of the situation before we head inside. Stumbling into a fight blindly never ends well.\n\nThere's an overlook east of the keep. Locals usually run a small market there. We can get a good view of the keep from that location.
{{55049764-6-15782:}}I see Shardmarshal Vargas standing on those rocks by the portal. This is the portal my legionary wants us to close, and I couldn't agree more.\n\nWe're in for a tough fight, but we can't fail. Destroy those anchors, comrade. Then we're out of here.
{{55049764-33-15960:}}Those bloodsuckers were hunting. That means they think there's still someone or something to find.\n\nLet's look around and see what they were searching for here in the tavern.
{{55049764-10-16178:}}You have many questions, I am sure. Place the fable on the dais to open the Scholarium door. \n\nWe will speak more, on power. Its meaning. And the art of Scribing.
{{55049764-2-16059:}}I failed my companions. When they needed me, I wasn't here. The Recollection has much to answer for. And so do I.
{{55049764-2-16058:}}It may be the jagga talking, but I think I'm beginning to see sense in what they're saying.
{{55049764-2-16051:}}The battle out here appears to be over except for a few straggling Daedra. Are we in the clear? What did you find in the barracks? And how did you wind up emerging from a portal?
{{55049764-2-16057:}}I can't believe it's come to this. Are we just old fools in the eyes of the village?
{{55049764-2-16056:}}You talk to the happy couple. I'm going to try to get the village pleasantly tipsy.
{{55049764-2-16055:}}Don't usually get overly emotional. But I'm … hmm. Why don't you talk to Laeni for a moment?
{{55049764-2-16054:}}This hardly feels real. They rutting stand with us! Singer be praised!
{{55049764-14-16269:}}You are on your final trial. The Wing of the Crow. Your time with us, your mastery of Scribing … you're so near the end. Good luck.
{{55049764-15-16266:}}You did it! I haven't been this happy since I got stuck in that barrel of fermented figs. Ooh, ooh! I made such a mess.\n\nAnyway, go talk to him! Go, go! Shoo!
{{55049764-15-16269:}}When I look back on our quest for justice together, when I see all that you've accomplished. \n\nI can't help but be impressed in spite of myself. Well done, mortal. Very well done.
{{55049764-14-15793:}}These workers must be some of the subjects Gallio mentioned in his journal. They're on the verge of turning into bloodfiends. \n\nI might be able to mix a counteragent with the proper ingredients.
{{55049764-21-16005:}}What's happening across West Weald threatens everyone, Wood Elves and Colovians alike.
{{55049764-12-16178:}}Remarkable feats of magic wait for you beyond that final door. All of it designed with you in mind, to allow you to prove your worth.\n\nAll you have learned in our many wings converges there. Make haste, fable-bearer. Reclaim what passes to you.
{{55049764-12-16170:}}Good! You found the lens. It will be your most important tool in tracing a path to the Luminaries. \n\nMerely holding the lens will attune you to the flow of magic. You will begin to see focal points, impressions left behind by these mystical beings.
{{55049764-7-16183:}}Who would have thought we'd lose a crucial tome like this to pests, of all things?\n\nThe Daedric Prince of Madness works hard, but apparently vermin work harder.
{{55049764-35-15960:}}I'm at a loss, friend. I was so focused on stopping Balandrus and saving Tham, I never gave a thought as to what comes next. I guess I need to figure it out.\n\nI told you I hate owing favors, but I can't help feeling that suddenly I owe a whole lot.
{{55049764-20-15802:}}We stopped Ithelia from using the Loom to restore her realm of Mirrormoor. Now she seeks to remake Apocrypha in her own image. The more it changes, the weaker Hermaeus Mora will grow.
{{55049764-20-15800:}}I think Betu wants to show us something. Come on!
{{55049764-26-15800:}}There's no time to waste, we must find the source of that scream!
{{55049764-1-16078:}}Perhaps I should read up on necromancy more first. Legends say the Ayleids had huge labor forces of undead, but nothing about their spellcasting abilities.
{{55049764-1-16076:}}I knew it! Calvo went and got himself killed, didn't he? Well, don't just stand there. Go tell the captain!
{{55049764-1-16077:}}You're back, but where's Calvo? Is he …?\n\nNo, don't tell me. Report to the captain, first.
{{55049764-2-16219:}}Their technique was a bit sloppy, but it's good to have seen a rite like that used again. How nice.
{{55049764-2-16218:}}Careful. I've lost a lot of comrades today, so I'm not in a trusting mood. Who are you and what do you want?
{{55049764-2-16211:}}Valaria sent you, right?\n\nWhy did she tell you to talk to me? It must have been for something interesting. She knows how I feel about inane interruptions.
{{55049764-2-16210:}}Well done getting the arcane knot out of there before things could go poorly. Good timing is either a matter of skill or luck. But Keshargo thinks you have the former. \n\nStill, he'll breathe easier knowing the knot is stabilized.
{{55049764-2-16212:}}You stopped! Good. I need help. Well, my expedition needs help. \n\nWe were trying to recover an artifact from the Lucent Citadel, but we were attacked. I don't know who else survived. I just ran through a portal and wound up here.
{{55049764-2-16217:}}Ulrath deserted the Legion? Did I hear that right?
{{55049764-5-15998:}}Speak to Beragon, proxy. Great events are in motion and the outcomes remain uncertain. Yet I can see a tenuous thread leading to Beragon. I think he has something in mind.
{{55049764-5-15991:}}I assumed the Recollection would be guarding the wildburn seed, but the tribune is right. They were expecting us.\n\nIf the Recollection does have a spy in Vashabar, then they're more dangerous than I thought.
{{55049764-5-15993:}}We must not allow the undead's plan to come to fruition. Based on the necromancer's notes, I believe we can exorcise the spirits by interrupting their ritual. It's their last link to this place.
{{55049764-4-15802:}}Mora's portal shall return us to Beragon's townhouse. I sense he has already sent our allies there.
{{55049764-4-15800:}}Let us look at the window from the outside. Perhaps our suspect was sloppy in their haste to escape.
{{55049764-4-15806:}}You and Fennorian. Never in the right place at the right time.\n\nSo, did you find what you were looking for? Share it with me and maybe I won't call down to the winery for my husband's army of mercenaries.
{{55049764-9-16178:}}Power can mean many things. Its meaning may change with each new day, each turn of the season. Ulfsild learned this hard lesson when the Scholarium slipped away.\n\nIf I am to teach you as I taught her, I must learn what power means to you.
{{55049764-9-16170:}}You've seen the hidden annotations, then? And you know where you are going?
{{55049764-1-16331:}}You're the new deputy that's been running around town asking questions. I'm not inclined to appreciate such activity. Bear that in mind as you conduct your business with the baron.
{{55049764-1-16332:}}Lady Raxalee is very busy. If you must talk to her, be succinct, be direct, and be polite. Then leave as soon as she dismisses you.
{{55049764-1-16337:}}Follow the commander's orders. He's gotten us out of worse situations than this.
{{55049764-1-16338:}}I owe you my life. I've seen what Daedra do to their enemies. But your skill with the ballista kept me alive. Thank you.
{{55049764-13-15991:}}I've been thinking about Ostumir and your investigations with Leramil and Tribune Alea. The Recollection was involved each time. We need to determine what they're planning next.\n\nMaybe the wildburn seed we found in Ostumir can help us do that.
{{55049764-6-15973:}}I'm glad you're back, friend. Now that the worst of things is over, I thought a celebration was in order—and Count Calantius agreed! Everyone should know what you did for West Weald. \n\nCracked acorns, what you did for all of reality!
{{55049764-6-15972:}}What a strange feeling! I'm not sure what to call it, but I'm definitely not sad that the Great Eye's plan actually worked. Not that I ever doubted it ….\n\nAnyway, the fabric of reality should totally restore itself now. Let's return to Beragon's.
{{55049764-13-16002:}}We've reached the shrine. Hold the Lamp close and Leramil says Azura will restore its energy.
{{55049764-10-15786:}}I'm not sure what I'm going to do once this is all over. I've grown used to all the hustle and bustle in my townhouse.\n\nAnyway, you shouldn't keep Scruut waiting. She's eager to hear what you learned.
{{55049764-1-16132:}}Clen and I were just talking about you! If you hadn't come to the village, we would never have gone through the rite. \n\nAnd now look at us. Assisting the greenspeaker with negotiations!
{{55049764-1-16130:}}I have no idea how I'm going to explain this to the head of my order. This will be a long and entertaining conversation.\n\nIn the meantime, you have a feathered scholar to speak with.
{{55049764-3-15998:}}Fascinating. Wendir is another Ayleid ruin, but the Skein of Secrets offers no explanation beyond a mark on a map. A subtle tool indeed, worthy of the Lady of Whispers.\n\nI am curious, proxy. What exactly did you see when you looked at the Skein?
{{55049764-3-15996:}}Day after day, I toil to make this place perfect for Count Calantius. Now these invaders appear and tear it all up!
{{55049764-3-15993:}}Arkay knows what horrors the undead may unleash if they complete the ritual. We must stop it!
{{55049764-0-16284:}}I've had my share of strange adventures, but helping you battle Daedra and save all of existence? That's beyond even the stories my little sister Eveli enjoys so much. But I guess this story isn't over just yet!\n\nI'll see you back at my townhouse.
{{55049764-0-16286:}}Hah, all this time, the Crow was Ulfsild! Kind of. Sort of. Amazing!\n\nKeep talking to her, we're so close to the end.
{{55049764-0-16287:}}I believe in you! I'll see you when you make it back to the Scholarium! Yeah!
{{55049764-0-16280:}}You have given your vow of charity.
{{55049764-0-16281:}}You have given your vow of loyalty.
{{55049764-0-16282:}}Don't worry, inheritor. I'll continue to guide Nahlia through the many challenges the Scholarium may present. \n\nIf nothing else, who will help her keep the Netch in line?
{{55049764-0-16288:}}There's so much to do, I can't find anything concrete on why the lumber camp was attacked. But I'll find it. I just need to talk to more people and call in more favors. I will figure out why my brother was killed. \n\nI owe him that much.
{{55049764-0-16134:}}I find it just sweltering, being in the city, don't you? But, I suppose I can weather a little discomfort if it means getting the chance to express my gratitude properly. \n\nAnd it seems there are many others who feel the same!
{{55049764-0-16132:}}I still can't believe Nantharion led a rutting Ayleid cult. Consorted with Daedra! Thanks to you, Greenspeaker Darolith will secure Vashabar's future.\n\nSinger hear my prayer, I think that future's going to be bright.
{{55049764-0-16130:}}I'm a touch nervous to bring this to the Votary Commander and Archmage Galerion. This is … well, this is going to come as quite a surprise. And those two hate surprises. \n\nI'll be fine. Probably.
{{55049764-0-16131:}}I can't believe the greenspeaker selected us to join her in Skingrad! I guess it's because you helped us with our betrothal. Thanks again for that, by the way.\n\nStill not sure about a Wood Elf living in a structure that wasn't grown, though.
{{55049764-4-16276:}}Ulfsild gave up so much when she left the Scholarium behind. It sounds like she found her own path, in the end. \n\nMakes me feel better about … all of this.
{{55049764-10-16286:}}We're in the Labyrinthian? Fascinating! Or some version created by the Crow's domain, anyway.\n\nI can't wait to find out why.
{{55049764-4-16183:}}If this Fox really was a friend of Ulfsild's, you'd think she'd have taught him not to deface books.\n\nSorry. Did you need something?
{{55049764-4-16182:}}Julian and I placed bets on what the pest would turn out to be. Turns out we were both wrong. Which, really, is the second-best option to being right.\n\nDid you need my help with something?
{{55049764-4-16184:}}This is what Ulfsild's notes were pointing to. I know it. After everything we've learned about her, I don't think she would have sent you on this tome chase for nothing.\n\nI know this is what she wanted you to do. But, um. Just in case. Good luck.
{{55049764-7-15806:}}Another one of my husband's guests? No, you're either an attendant or a servant, I'd wager. Who brought you to my husband's little affair, pray tell?
{{55049764-7-15802:}}Once again the Daedric Princes seek the counsel of a mortal. But what else can we do besides reseal her prison?\n\nTalk to her, proxy, and see what inspiration strikes you.
{{55049764-19-15793:}}This wine is specifically meant for the mortals here, not the vampires. So why are the vampires bidding on it? And why is my flask doing little to curb my rising hunger?\n\nTell me you learned something more, my friend.
{{55049764-9-15972:}}Place the Skein of Secrets near the reality tear. Just try not to get sucked into the gaping maw. I don't have time to go back and fetch another mortal.
{{55049764-9-15973:}}That was simple enough. Now I guess you need to use the spell scroll. That's supposed to release Abolisher's energy and heal this portion of the fabric of reality.\n\nYou know, I never knew such a thing existed. Well, other than a metaphor.
{{55049764-9-15971:}}Use the Lamp. I've got a feeling it might have something to reveal to us here.
{{55049764-9-15975:}}Beragon just turned up with a story about relics and welkynd stones and a Recollection stronghold in some Ayleid ruin. I had a hard time keeping up with it all. Maybe you should talk to him, comrade.
{{55049764-19-16266:}}That's three, right? You've really got a knack for this kind of thing! Is it possible … have you ever been a fox?
{{55049764-4-16248:}}What a marvelous game we just played! And you did it without my lithe and stylish tendrils. \n\nEven I must admit I could not have done it better.
{{55049764-8-15793:}}Go ahead and scout the path to the laboratory. I'll make sure these three get to safety, then follow right behind you.
{{55049764-8-15797:}}Many lives were lost despite our best efforts. There is certainly joy to be found in our success, but this one will spend many a night wondering if there was more that could be done. Perhaps he is not as good an investigator as he thought.
{{55049764-8-15798:}}I would never do anything like this. You must believe me.
{{55049764-14-16021:}}Another Ithelia? Another … me? She wishes to speak to you. Perhaps she has answers we seek. \n\nAsk her about Sage's Dream, mortal. Ask her why the very thought of it spins within the storm in my mind.
{{55049764-21-15802:}}The Lamp of Clarity might serve us here. Unleash its light and let us see what secrets it reveals.
{{55049764-21-15800:}}Our imposter is dead and our killer nearly succeeded in taking Betu's life as well. It is also not lost on Mizzik as to who is missing from this room.\n\nThe note you found with imposter Theophan's body, what does it say?
{{55049764-4-16321:}}No one's ever had any problems staying in Legion's Rest before. This is so bad!
{{55049764-1-15864:}}We found her, proxy. Ithelia, the Prince of Paths.\n\nApproach her carefully. She may appear in the guise of a mortal, but she is the very incarnation of the Daedric power that permeates this place.
{{55049764-1-15865:}}I do not recognize you, yet you seem familiar. Almost like this shrine … I know I should remember it, but I do not.\n\nTell me, what is this place? Why am I drawn here?
{{55049764-1-15866:}}Thank you for helping us. Please tell me you're also here to stop Lord Valente.
{{55049764-1-15868:}}Speak, fate's chosen. You were deep in conversation with the Prince of Paths. What do your mortal eyes see that elude my Daedric senses?
{{55049764-23-15971:}}Leramil can use your help. She wants you to assist her in investigating the Outcast Inn.\n\nHelp her out, then check in again.
{{55049764-4-16125:}}This is my end, pathwalker. Hermaeus Mora has declared me a threat to reality and comes to imprison me. I am tired of fighting. It is the same on every path I have examined. If this is my fate, so be it.\n\nTake my tirum weed and go with my blessing.
{{55049764-16-15782:}}Glad we found Gaius among the living. Grab that map and we'll track down the key to the catacombs. I want to make certain the staff and remaining legionaries are safe.
{{55049764-16-15786:}}I think it worked! Abolisher certainly looks full of energy now to me! I'll see you back at my townhouse in Skingrad.
{{55049764-3-16075:}}I can't go back in there. I'm hurt! One of the bastards must have grazed me as we made our retreat. When you talk to the captain, tell him I'm grievously wounded!
{{55049764-3-16076:}}I'm not sure who you are or what you want, but you should probably speak to the captain.
{{55049764-3-16077:}}Did the Legion send you? You should talk to the captain.
{{55049764-9-15800:}}Let Mizzik see the note. An anonymous letter warning Lady Weatherleah of a traitor? This one wonders if they were able to meet before her death. It paints a disturbing picture of her final moments.
{{55049764-11-15972:}}I'll meet you in Apocrypha, mortal. I much prefer my master's realm to any of the frail, insignificant locations in this pitiful plane of existence.
{{55049764-11-15973:}}Scruut explained that we need to find a reality tear inside this cave. That's where you need to set Abolisher and use the spell scroll.\n\nI'm here to help in any way I can!
{{55049764-11-15971:}}I've got no talent for spells, but I picked up a bit of arcane lore in my time. The ancient Ayleids were fascinated with light. They devised ways to harness its magicka. Or draw it from aetherial crystals, like this burnt-out stone.
{{55049764-13-16129:}}You stopped! Thank you. Vanus Galerion himself said you could help us with this predicament. I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't flag you down.
{{55049764-10-16035:}}Your first task is to familiarize yourself with what's happening here. The graveyard is a good place to start. Notice the number of recent markers and the similar causes of death.\n\nGo on. We can talk again after you examine the newer grave markers.
{{55049764-7-16045:}}The One Who Knows remains silent. I believe we are now passing through another conjunction of threads of fate in which he dares not interfere.
{{55049764-8-16264:}}Please, go on ahead. I don't have the strength to deal with people right now. \n\nHead to Ontus and look for my delight in Stonechip Tavern. When I'm in a good mood, I'm drawn anywhere with drinks and noise and crowds. Ugh.
{{55049764-8-16269:}}Injustice did not rest while I slumbered. Your time will be well used on these tasks.\n\nAnd while you are gone, the Fox and I will have some time to catch up. I missed him, dearly.
{{55049764-19-16005:}}What perfect luck, my friend! You're exactly who I need right now. These people are safe, but there's others in the village of Ostumir still trapped by rubble or worse. Can you help me find them?\n\nThe quakes could start again, so we need to hurry.
{{55049764-12-15798:}}Apologies for Betu's earlier mischief. I hope he didn't damage the will. He's normally better behaved, but the Lady's passing has certainly got him on edge.
{{55049764-3-15785:}}Back to Tamriel? Thank the ancestors! As much as I enjoy traveling with Leramil … and you, too, friend … I think I've had my fill of Oblivion planes.
{{55049764-0-16208:}}I don't know how to thank you. Not just for saving my life, but for bringing us together to face this. I've spent years trying to run away from who I used to be. But I really needed to turn around and face my past honestly.
{{55049764-0-16209:}}It appears that our adventure is at an end. I will admit, it did not go exactly as planned. But all true adventures include some deep bruises and frantic screaming, right? \n\nI am right, aren't I?
{{55049764-0-16206:}}Thank you again for saving Val. And for putting up with my antics throughout all of this. The Scarlets are the closest thing to a family I've ever known.\n\nBut maybe it's time to swim in the swamp for a bit.
{{55049764-0-16207:}}You know, Marcien's the reason I came here in the first place. They always told me how beautiful the land was. They were right, of course, but I can't help hoping Marcien might stick a little closer to town for a while.\n\nThank you, traveler.
{{55049764-0-16202:}}It feels like we're close. Whatever Ulfsild hid here will hopefully give you the answers we need.\n\nStay safe and keep an eye out for focal points. If the orcs haven't found it yet, it's likely because it's hidden behind her magics.
{{55049764-11-16054:}}Thamech, traveler. That's an old way of saying hello. Welcome to the village of Vashabar.
{{55049764-22-16266:}}Oh my gosh, I was right! You're trying to fix Ulfsild's library! You're trying to talk to the Gryphon aren't you?\n\nI am so sorry about tearing all the pages out of that book.
{{55049764-8-16060:}}Looking to learn how to handle a blade? You've come to the right place, but I'm not taking on new students right now.
{{55049764-8-16061:}}Welcome, welcome, welcome! Newly grown, fertile ground. Vashabar is a place to put down roots.
{{55049764-17-16204:}}Good, you're back. My old comrades showed up shortly before you did. Thank you for getting them here.\n\nWe all came to an understanding. If the law won't deal with whoever's killing the Scarlets, the job falls to us.
{{55049764-6-16061:}}I'm like a litter of fisher pups on the inside, all flailing limbs and lashing tails. I can't believe Laeni thinks she has to leave town. Her father will be heartbroken. \n\nY'ffre's tears, I'll be heartbroken!
{{55049764-12-16002:}}Torvesard? The Dremora that serves Ithelia? Be on your guard but see what he has to say.
{{55049764-26-15778:}}It seems we go from one doom to another, proxy. But Ithelia and Torvesard are out there somewhere. I suspect they are the source of Scruut's agitation. \n\nSpeak to the Watchling and find out what doom she wants us to deal with this time.
{{55049764-10-16204:}}Marcan Caelum can't have gotten very far with a captive to manage. He must be hiding nearby, and the cellars of the old house are our best bet. Inside, quickly!
{{55049764-10-16206:}}Hooke is the one you want to talk to. Unless you want a moment-by-moment report of how this hangover's treating me.
{{55049764-10-16208:}}I need to get my son and Norraine away from Vashabar. Away … from me, where it's safer for them. I'll make the arrangements. But I'll still be here when you're back.\n\nIf you want to read the note, I think I tossed it somewhere beside my home.
{{55049764-11-16276:}}These echoes must be from Ulfsild's final days here. They're so personal. And, unfortunately, none are quite as instructive as the ones she left in the Scholarium.
{{55049764-7-16054:}}The site where Vashabar's growth began isn't far. Just refer to your map and I'll meet you there. \n\nAnd don't worry, traveler. You'll have a damned greenspeaker-to-be at your side!
{{55049764-7-16058:}}Hmm. Yes, hello. I'm sorry, I'm a bit busy at the moment. Vashabar is newly grown and we still have much to do. \n\nI hope you understand.
{{55049764-1-16279:}}What lies always ahead of you though you will never see it? What is always coming but never arrives?\n\nExistence itself is a mystery, an unmapped territory spread out before you. Will you take a vow to explore it?
{{55049764-1-16274:}}Well, at least you got a confession out of her.
{{55049764-1-16275:}}She's a monster, she has no remorse at all!
{{55049764-1-16276:}}It seems like just yesterday I was getting bored and a little bitter patrolling ruins and making portals. Now I'm not sure I'll ever be bored again!\n\nAnd all because of our adventures together.
{{55049764-1-16271:}}Don't talk to me until you're better looking.
{{55049764-1-16272:}}Please make yourself comfortable, traveler. There's plenty of ale to go around.
{{55049764-1-16273:}}Did you feel it, traveler? The ground shook so hard that what remained of our poor village crumbled around me. I can still hear my neighbor's cry as the roof fell on her.\n\nI'm sorry. It's just all too much.
{{55049764-3-15798:}}Thank you, friend! I couldn't bear to think of what would happen if we hadn't treated Betu in time.
{{55049764-3-15799:}}Oh! Sorry. Probably not the best idea to sneak up on someone juggling knives. Especially sneaking up on one rehearsing for their debut performance in Skingrad!
{{55049764-3-15796:}}Rapid new foliage growth is dangerous! I suppose everyone is trying to be generous and welcoming to the Wood Elves, but guests don't destroy the crops or land. It's an outrage!
{{55049764-3-15797:}}Grab the will before the dog runs off with it again!
{{55049764-3-15790:}}Julianos help me, this is a logistical nightmare! Please tell me you're here to help. I've been putting out fires across West Weald nonstop and our forces are wearing thin.\n\nI'll gladly put you to work if you're interested.
{{55049764-3-15792:}}The signal fires. That was you? Wait, that scroll …. I gave those orders to a legionary. \n\nWho are you and what happened to my legionary?
{{55049764-3-15793:}}Let's get out of here before the vats explode! I'll meet you outside!
{{55049764-1-15996:}}I stashed the key inside the old statue in the garden. Don't worry. I'll draw you a map.\n\nJust be careful wandering in the garden. We've had an infestation of odd bugs recently. Odd and dangerous.
{{55049764-1-15997:}}Hail, mercenary. Tribune Alea ordered me to find you right away. You won a battle in the ruins under Vashabar, but Beragon thinks the war for West Weald isn't over yet. They still need your help.
{{55049764-1-15991:}}That was close! But at least we destroyed the seed and this Recollection fortress.\n\nBut … I hoped things would turn out differently for Greenspeaker Sorilen. I wish I knew what drove her into the arms of the Recollection and their mad leaders.
{{55049764-1-15993:}}Once I have secured the ritual items, I will be able to put this whole thing behind me. Let this be a lesson, friend. Necromancy is a dark, volatile business. And it stinks, too.
{{55049764-1-15998:}}I have not observed Abolisher up close, but I know it is a blade sharp enough to cut a door between the realms. Let us put that to the test here, proxy.
{{55049764-1-15999:}}I wouldn't go into Faro's Cavern, stranger. That … tear … it's terrible! The light … the sound ….\n\nAnd if you get too close … you fall into the nothingness!
{{55049764-11-16210:}}A friendly face is always a welcome sight, Keshargo only wishes he could enjoy it. \n\nThe Lucent Citadel was supposed to be empty, so Keshargo hired explorers, not warriors. But, we have just been attacked. So, he would like to hire you.
{{55049764-6-15975:}}Even if we can see where Nantharion used the staff, there's no guarantee we'll still find him at those sites. I'll confer with my scouts and get help from Vashabar. The more eyes out there helping us look for the Recollection, the better.
{{55049764-0-16078:}}Save me the chastising. I'm sure a fellow necromancer like yourself knows we all have to start somewhere.
{{55049764-0-16073:}}I feel like there's something I've forgotten. Something important …. Well, it'll come back to me. How can I help you?
{{55049764-0-16077:}}I hope Calvo survives long enough for Legion reinforcements to arrive. Either way, he's a real hero. I'll make sure to head to Ontus and tell his family what he did for us.
{{55049764-0-16076:}}Calvo is really up there? Ringing that bell all on his own? Hard to believe. Maybe he really is the best of us.
{{55049764-0-16075:}}Calvo is up in the bell tower? Ringing the bell? He's just trying to look good in front of the captain. I could have gone up there and done that—if I hadn't gotten injured, that is.
{{55049764-11-15856:}}Ah, proxy, I bear grim news. The secret Hermaeus Mora guarded has escaped and Ithelia is forgotten no more. Strange disturbances and disorder now wrack these lands.\n\nWest Weald suffers, but by following these occurrences, we may just find her.
{{55049764-6-16056:}}This whole situation is as foul as a midden the day before chores. I just hope Gundelion or Malaniel can help us out. \n\nAnd don't worry, I'll have those supplies sorted soon enough.
{{55049764-11-15852:}}A friend of Mizzik's is a friend of mine. After all, my aunt was quite fond of him and she was always an excellent judge of character. I won't mince words. I hope you and Mizzik find my aunt's killer. I'm certain this was no accident.
{{55049764-15-16021:}}That lamp led us onto the Many Paths. But why would the lamp bring us here? And why do I hate it so much?\n\nPerhaps the answers lie at the end of this path.
{{55049764-21-15778:}}A tear in reality would certainly explain the frayed and shredded threads of fate. We must examine this tear, proxy.
{{55049764-16-16021:}}I know this. It is a doorway to the Many Paths. I cannot describe the relief that comes with even a modicum of understanding.\n\nThat lamp wanted to reveal that doorway. Step through and I will follow.
{{55049764-10-15852:}}If you are looking for the stranger who calls himself Uriel, he went to walk the estate grounds with Pelena. And not a moment too soon. I was growing tired of their bickering.
{{55049764-15-16204:}}You're back! But where's Naku?
{{55049764-15-16206:}}Luckily, the road to Skingrad has plenty of bends and curves. I'm not entirely sure I could manage a straight line right now.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'll wait a spell before heading off to meet Hooke.
{{55049764-2-15847:}}Legionary Calvo can get you into the fort through a side passage and guide you inside.\n\nYou need to find the communique that contains the current chime sequence, the key to the bell tower, and then grab our payroll before those deserters find it.
{{55049764-2-15840:}}What are you waiting for? Give her the drink already!
{{55049764-2-15849:}}Thank Malacath you're back. Grander's pitiful whimpering was beginning to drive me mad. Go talk to him. And if he say's he hasn't been crying, he's lying.
{{55049764-2-15848:}}Betu has always been the incorrigible sort. Best not to let him walk all over you. \n\nApologies. I should introduce myself. My name is Edric Brussiner. I was Lady Weatherleah's cook. A terrible thing, her death. Beyond compare.
{{55049764-5-15785:}}Shh, I'm listening to this!
{{55049764-5-15786:}}Curate Gadayn, he saved you from that reality tear. I didn't know him all that well, but he was clearly important to Leramil. And to you as well, I assume. I'm so sorry.
{{55049764-5-15781:}}This Aetherial alarum will help untether the shards from their surroundings. I'll meet you at the first shard inside the ruins and show you how it works.\n\nJust don't break it. Or lose it. Or hold it too close to your face.
{{55049764-5-15780:}}Legion's Rest has always been a safe place to rest. Very troubling to find it filled with rogues and beasts.
{{55049764-5-15782:}}Do you see Shardmarshal Vargas up on those rocks? As much as I want to pay her back for Feldagard Keep, we need to close that portal. We can't let any more Daedra come through.\n\nFocus on destroying the anchors. Then we'll find a way out of here.
{{55049764-2-16009:}}I was afraid we'd lost Tribune Alea forever. I'm glad she had the sense to find these mirrors and wait for help!\n\nGo on, friend. The sooner we're out of this place, the better.
{{55049764-19-16204:}}Well, I suppose you saw that. It's been twenty years, and Sergeant Corvus is still a stuck-up Colovian prig. Two lives cut short—but we were deserters, so he thinks we got what we deserved.\n\nDamn it all. Maybe he's right.
{{55049764-8-15850:}}I was under the impression <<1>> worked alone. But I'm sure it can't hurt to have another bright mind on the case. I hope he finds <<2>>'s death to be a tragic accident. Anything else is too horrible to imagine.
{{55049764-8-15852:}}I was in the study when I thought I heard an argument. I came to investigate, but it was too late. Uriel was on the floor and someone dashed out of the entryway. I, I don't know what to do.
{{55049764-8-15856:}}Let me mark your map. Frayed threads of fate point to Rustwall, the Elenglynn ruins, and Ostumir. And take this relic, the Echonir. You might find it useful.\n\nMy friend Beragon offered his townhouse in Skingrad. Let us meet there when we are done.
{{55049764-8-15857:}}Bandits. The captain says there was a time when those kind of scum would never challenge the Legion.
{{55049764-19-16206:}}This is all too much. I was happier when I was drunk. Safer, too.
{{55049764-20-15960:}}Packs like that are a common sight in Sutch. Miners from the town of Ontus and around the region pass through here on a regular basis.\n\nTough decision to toss it, but better to lose your livelihood than your life.
{{55049764-0-15779:}}Can you feel it? Reality itself is splitting at the seams! We need to hurry, mortal!
{{55049764-0-15778:}}Come, proxy. The portal to Apocrypha awaits us. And once on the other side, use the Skein and see if it can pinpoint Ithelia's true location.\n\nShe and Torvesard have much to answer for.
{{55049764-0-15771:}}I am Nantharion, king in the Dawnwood.
{{55049764-0-15770:}}I'm sure part of me will miss the comforts of Skingrad, but it will be a long while before I return. There's so much of the world to see. Why stay trapped by the familiar?
{{55049764-0-15772:}}If Ruri was in trouble and needed gold, he should have just asked me. Now all he gets is a cold dungeon cell in Skingrad for his trouble.
{{55049764-0-15774:}}You and Orissa were having a rather tense conversation. Nothing amiss, I hope.
{{55049764-8-16207:}}Versidue and the young guzzard get along better than I dreamed! Still, my little guzzard could use an adult to learn from. I asked Marcien for one, but that was ages ago.\n\nI'll gladly pay you for your trouble if you find an adult guzzard for me.
{{55049764-3-16242:}}Hmm, do you have a notion of what to do? Where to go? With your allies at your side, craft a riddle that will confound my thinking.\n\nI know you have it in you.
{{55049764-3-16241:}}That look on your face. The Dragon gave you her trial, didn't she? She asked you to craft a riddle she can't solve.
{{55049764-3-16247:}}Thank you. It means a lot that we could help Elic find some … closure. I'm not sure he would have ever forgiven himself, if we hadn't been there today.
{{55049764-3-16246:}}I hope nothing else has been tampered with. There's already so much wrong in the Scholarium. So much that didn't stand the test of time.
{{55049764-3-16249:}}You work with Nahlia? Are you with the Mages Guild? Maybe there's something you can do to help my father?
{{55049764-3-16248:}}Go on. Take my sigil Not-Ulfsild! Before I decide there are new and better games to play.
{{55049764-9-15802:}}Use the Mirror of Truth! Show Ithelia how the power of the Loom has corrupted her.
{{55049764-4-16060:}}I respect their choice … but the village just won't be the same without them.
{{55049764-4-16061:}}I'm like a wading bird in a dried-up pond, traveler. Hoping for fish when all I have is mud.
{{55049764-4-16062:}}The Wilderhall is just east of here. The rite may be just what Laeni and Clendagal need. What Vashabar needs.\n\nI suggest you take it over to Ciiril when you find the text. She'll be instrumental in enacting the rite.
{{55049764-13-15856:}}The threads of fate converge here in West Weald. Yet I cannot untangle them or see where they lead. It is a sign the Prince of Paths walks these lands.
{{55049764-17-15983:}}I'm still not convinced these Vashabar Wood Elves are innocent, but I'll take Beragon and meet you at the spot the greenspeaker indicated. \n\nI know the Colovian Hills well. If there are Recollection or anything else out there, I'll find it.
{{55049764-13-16005:}}Sorilen asked us to meet her at the Ayleid ruins southeast of the village. Let's head there now. I'm curious to see what she invited me here to show me.
{{55049764-17-16043:}}I'll start repairing the ballista. Not my first time putting one of these weapons back together. Go talk to Commander Merian and find out what he wants you to do.
{{55049764-7-16207:}}These guzzards remind me of home and how important it is to have a flock. I lost my pet wormmouth on the journey here. I can't imagine he's still alive, but I'd give anything to have him back.\n\nPlease let me know if you see any sign of him.
{{55049764-7-16206:}}To think Marcan Caelum was holed up down here for years, plotting to pick us off one by one. And I let him snatch Valenia like a bottle off the shelf. \n\nWe have to save her!
{{55049764-7-16205:}}No time to talk! I've got to get this door open!
{{55049764-7-16204:}}If we have any hope of saving Val, we have to act now. Let's go!
{{55049764-25-15971:}}Tribune Alea's legionary found you? Good!\n\nThe map we found at Hoperoot contains a valuable clue—I just need some time to decipher the code. But one thing is already clear. King Nantharion and his allies aren't done with West Weald yet.
{{55049764-21-16043:}}We made it in easily enough, but that's just the beginning. Tracking down Commander Merian is our objective now.\n\nI don't know what we'll find inside, so stay alert.
{{55049764-10-16129:}}This is all so exciting! I can barely keep myself from spreading it around the rest of the guild.
{{55049764-9-15778:}}Proceed with caution, proxy. Ithelia's first creation shall not fall easily.\n\nScruut and I shall consult the appropriate texts and be prepared when you return with the shard.
{{55049764-9-15779:}}Go on. Leramil opened a perfectly good portal. It will get you to Fargrave and close to the Loom. Just watch out for those Mirrormoor Daedra. They're popping up everywhere lately.\n\nI'll wait here. Apprise your other allies when they arrive.
{{55049764-4-16021:}}My scion … Torvesard. No, not mine. Just another reflection. Still, he wishes to speak. Talk to him, mortal. Ask about the final ingredient.
{{55049764-2-16005:}}Sorilen joined the Recollection. The group I'm actively trying to stop. Cracked acorns, that hurts!\n\nIt seems they want to take back land that once belonged to the Ayleids. If that's why they built an army, they're more dangerous than I thought.
{{55049764-2-16002:}}A Daedric ritual? That's not something I get to see every day.
{{55049764-2-16003:}}Mother demanded we return for the family jewels. Priceless heirlooms, she kept insisting. I begged her to let them go.\n\nWe should never have come back here.
{{55049764-36-15960:}}Turn back, traveler. There's trouble in the town of Sutch that you want no part of.\n\nVampire trouble.
{{55049764-12-16129:}}You stopped, amazing! The adept that helped return Eyevea to Nirn ….\n\nAh, sorry. Vanus Galerion himself asked me to find you. We have a bit of a predicament.
{{55049764-20-16005:}}I'm glad you happened by. This woman will be fine, but there's plenty more injured in what's left of the village of Ostumir. Maybe you could help me find them.\n\nThe ground could shake again at any moment. We need to hurry and save whoever we can.
{{55049764-16-15960:}}The stables are nearby, right on the edge of town. If Grivier's there, I'll make him talk.
{{55049764-1-16043:}}A good officer gives credit where credit is due. You did good, comrade. Feldagard Keep needs to rebuild and do some cleanup, but we repelled an invasion and gained a valuable tool.\n\nNot bad for a day's work. If only I could shake this feeling ….
{{55049764-1-16042:}}The constable has no idea who she's dealing with!
{{55049764-1-16041:}}I knew this was a bad idea. Why did I ever let that alchemist talk me into this?
{{55049764-1-16045:}}The permutations of fate created a high probability that you … ah. I would like to talk about the relics I heard you describe to Beragon.\n\nThe Lamp of Clarity and Abolisher are two of the relics once used to defeat and imprison Ithelia.
{{55049764-5-16021:}}Mora's forces breached the shrine on this path. These Shardborn battle for their very existence, and the Ithelia of this realm's anger fills the air.\n\nI am safe from harm, but a mortal like you can die even when walking a different path. Be warned.
{{55049764-2-15770:}}I know the tharriker are intimidating beasts, but if you're gentle, they'll respond in kind. Usually.
{{55049764-2-15774:}}Don't know what Orissa expects to find. The bastards are likely gone by now. Nothing but a waste of time to search that cave.
{{55049764-2-15779:}}Reality is falling apart around us and you want to chat? Well, then go talk to Leramil and let's figure out where we can find Prince Ithelia!
{{55049764-2-15778:}}Ithelia has become the threat that Hermaeus Mora foresaw, racing to Apocrypha to take the realm as her own. And with each passing moment, reality breaks down a little more.\n\nTime grows ever shorter, proxy.
{{55049764-1-15768:}}To think that masked brigand was Amaurel Verdulis. How many seasons we spent planning this marriage! If I may be vulnerable for just a moment? I had grown quite excited. Not for the business of it all, the coin, but to be held.
{{55049764-4-15856:}}Now it becomes clear. The Recollection also seeks Ithelia. They hope to find her visiting places she once knew, just as we did.\n\nAnd Ithelia seems less confused than what you observed at the Outcast Inn. Her memories return and she grows confident.
{{55049764-4-15850:}}If it's true, and the cook and the gardener conspired to have Lady Weatherleah killed, then I must have been next. How ghastly. How positively ghoulish. I'll not sleep well knowing I was so close to death.
{{55049764-9-16129:}}I read that Fable of the Dragon too. This Luminary in the Wing of the Dragon … she's not a real Dragon, is she?\n\nA real Dragon in here! Can you imagine? No, no. Surely not.
{{55049764-0-16338:}}We'll get started on repairing the breach right away. It'll be some time before we have a main gate again, but we can build stronger barricades in the meantime.\n\nThank you for saving me. I appreciate your efforts, mercenary.
{{55049764-0-16339:}}When Commander Merian looks relaxed, then you know we're safe. He seems quite pleased with you. That's rare, especially since you're a mercenary.\n\nI owe you a debt of gratitude for saving me with that ballista. I hope I can return the favor one day.
{{55049764-0-16331:}}You heard the baron. We've got nothing to hide.
{{55049764-0-16332:}}I'm pretty sure I heard Lady Raxalee ask you to please leave.
{{55049764-0-16333:}}When this is all over, you must remind me how you convinced me to get involved in a war between the Daedra.
{{55049764-0-16334:}}If I survive to tell her this story, my little sister will never believe it.
{{55049764-0-16336:}}The threads of fate continue to unravel. Ithelia might be compliant for the moment, but the situation is still untenable. We must see what accord she and the Great Eye can reach.
{{55049764-0-16337:}}The smell of burning oil from the barricade makes me feel safe. Odd, huh?\n\nGo chase down those Daedra with Tribune Alea. We're all set here.
{{55049764-21-16266:}}It's a little dirty. I can clean it off if you like? No, I … I've done enough already. You just take it.
{{55049764-6-16020:}}Proxy, your arrival is well-timed. A tangle in the threads of fate grows like a knot around the Outcast Inn. Something frays the bonds of cause and effect here. If they snap, the results would be catastrophic.
{{55049764-8-16118:}}I've decided to assist you here in West Weald. I'll meet you at the location Scruut marked on your map.
{{55049764-27-15778:}}The One Who Knows was wise to put his faith in you. With the Loom destroyed, Ithelia's plan to rewrite history has been thwarted. Enjoy this moment, proxy. The threads of fate rarely weave such a victory.
{{55049764-5-16182:}}Even with this little page thief in residence I'm sure you'll find your way. We couldn't have gotten this far without you, no reason to think we won't get farther yet.
{{55049764-5-16183:}}Didn't even get the chance to copy the Fable of the Gryphon for posterity, before it was ripped away from us. Damn it. \n\nWe'll keep looking for a solution here, adventurer.
{{55049764-5-16184:}}That was certainly an adventure, wasn't it? A jaunt through ancient ruins to craft an unsolvable riddle. Not what I expected when I woke up this morning, but exactly what I needed.\n\nWhat was in her last notes? Anything that will help?
{{55049764-5-16020:}}I am glad you are here, proxy. Threads of fate tangle around the Outcast Inn in an ever-expanding knot, fraying the bonds of cause and effect with each bend and twist. Should they snap, the results would be catastrophic.
{{55049764-17-16005:}}Inside the village, listen for any calls for help. People could be buried under rubble or trapped inside collapsed buildings. Just watch out for the strange beasts. They appeared after the ground shook.\n\nAnd, keep an eye out for Greenspeaker Sorilen.
{{55049764-17-16002:}}I'm not used to taking orders from a floating ball of eyes and tentacles.
{{55049764-2-15772:}}Apologies for dashing off like that. Those horrible crystaljacks were really starting to unnerve me. Besides, I wanted to get Lazen to safety. \n\nNow, what was in that note you grabbed?
{{55049764-6-15960:}}Same as last time. Place the canister and then stand clear.
{{55049764-3-16162:}}I've never seen Goblins so agitated. I hope it's not too late to return the totems to them. I'd hate to have to write up this incident as a tragedy, not if it can be stopped.
{{55049764-3-16163:}}It's done. The altar is quiet and for the first time in centuries, Scribing has returned to Tamriel. \n\nIt's clear Ulfsild did not send you. But I believe she would be quite proud of you just the same.
{{55049764-3-16166:}}Have you seen the devastation at Dawnwood's borders? It's just awful. I know it isn't anyone's fault, but I can't help but wonder how the Colovians feel. \n\nAll we wanted was to nurture lands they've forgotten.
{{55049764-6-15966:}}My interactions with the One Who Knows have been complicated and interesting in the century we have been associated, but never anything such as we have encountered.\n\nI am glad you were beside me in all this, proxy.
{{55049764-0-16106:}}The baroness blames herself? She's been good to us, regardless of what happened today. I still trust her.
{{55049764-0-16105:}}I hope we're able to gather what's left of our belongings. There are treasured memories buried in the rubble.
{{55049764-0-16104:}}You've made it possible for us to rebuild, I thank you for that. I won't forget your heroism.
{{55049764-0-16103:}}The future can change. Tiny things change the future. My wisps see these things and predict what is to come. Perhaps your fortune will be different next time we meet.
{{55049764-18-16248:}}I sense that you're a particularly buoyant soul. Is it because of me? My mere presence has been known to make the world seem lighter, brighter. More netchy.
{{55049764-25-16266:}}Ah, the Dragon! We can all learn something from her. Some of us more than others.\n\nMe, for instance. I have a lot to learn. Please don't ask me to solve any of her riddles for you.
{{55049764-4-16286:}}I can't say I've ever crossed an invisible bridge before, but there's a first for everything right? \n\nRight. We can do this. No problem.
{{55049764-6-16182:}}Don't worry, a few wards around the library and we'll make sure the page thief doesn't strike again.\n\nIn the meantime, perhaps Nahlia has found something left behind by Ulfsild over in the east wing.
{{55049764-11-15840:}}Finally, she speaks! I think the woman wants something from you. Go talk to her. Maybe she'll tell you what she wants and we can finally get her to leave.
{{55049764-28-15802:}}Not even the realm of the One Who Knows is safe from the unraveling of existence.
{{55049764-28-15800:}}See what <<1>> has brought us.
{{55049764-4-15855:}}You've chosen a poor time to come and trade, traveler. Leftwheal is under siege by the Recollection and their bizarre beasts. If you can lend aid, tend to the wounded, if not, you best be on your way.
{{55049764-4-15857:}}Don't worry, friend. I can lead you to the communique, the bell tower key, and the cohort payroll. All part of my training as the captain's aide-de-camp.\n\nThis passage isn't used much, so it should be mostly clear. Well, except for the bears.
{{55049764-13-16206:}}I'll amble over that way, sure. Hooke can buy me a round or two for my trouble. Of course, if there's really a killer on my tail, and they see me wobbling on the road … eh, I'll just hide in some tall grass.
{{55049764-4-15852:}}Otho did his best to explain your findings, but is it really true? Pelena is to blame for this nightmare?
{{55049764-7-15975:}}I see Legionary Caepio delivered the message. Good!\n\nBeragon thinks he's found a way to locate Nantharion. I won't try to explain. Beragon can do it better. Talk to him, comrade.
{{55049764-7-15971:}}The Ayleids loved magical portals even more than clever traps. I bet the remaining three stones are hidden in places we need portals to reach. A good thing you've got Abolisher for that.
{{55049764-7-15972:}}Another nexus point tear healed, but you aren't done yet. Go place the remaining relics. I'll meet you at Beragon's mortal domicile when you're done.
{{55049764-7-15973:}}That was the last relic and the last reality tear. Let's head back to my townhouse and check with Leramil and Scruut. They can tell us if we preserved reality or not, right?
{{55049764-22-15971:}}Tribune Alea can use a hand. She went to Feldagard Keep to warn them about the attack plans we found at Hoperoot.\n\nMeet her there and provide any assistance she requires, then return here.
{{55049764-32-15778:}}I am relieved to see our world remains whole. I was reasonably certain you destroyed Ithelia's Loom before she could weave a new history, but it is good to have that belief confirmed.\n\nSpeak with Beragon, proxy. He is waiting for you.
{{55049764-2-16248:}}Did you come to see who I'm going to trick next? My tendrils are already in motion, already reaching out.
{{55049764-2-16249:}}I'm tempted to follow you into those portals, but I need to stay with my father.
{{55049764-2-16242:}}I have been sitting here mulling what morsel you might lay at my feet, mortal. \n\nI honestly hope I am not disappointed. Out with it. What is your riddle?
{{55049764-2-16241:}}If you're looking for inspiration, search the many libraries within the Scholarium. \n\nSomewhere Ulfsild must have left behind notes about how she approached the Dragon's task.
{{55049764-2-16246:}}The ink does not yet flow. I assume you are still working to complete the Netch's trial?
{{55049764-2-16247:}}Creating portals from afar like that really pushed my understanding of portal magic, and what I thought I knew.\n\nI get the feeling that was part of the point? The Netch certainly is tricksy.
{{55049764-2-16245:}}I can't imagine a more embarrassing way to die than being trapped in my own net, pecked to death by guzzards. I didn't think anyone would find me out here. What brings you to these parts?
{{55049764-5-15969:}}It's strange. When I first retreated from Niryastare, I wondered for years what was hidden in that vault. Never guessed it was the relic of a Daedric Prince.\n\nNow that you're here, let's take stock of our recent discoveries.
{{55049764-6-16055:}}Keep your eyes open. The Heartland Elves offer many lessons to those willing to listen. But other things live in these ruins now.
{{55049764-15-15973:}}I'm not sure what happened. After we defeated Torvesard, I stepped through that portal and found myself back here.\n\nI'm dying to know what became of Ithelia, but you should talk to Leramil first.
{{55049764-13-15786:}}Go on. Plunge the blade into the hot coals. If anything is going to restore Abolisher, it's the fires of Boethiah.
{{55049764-13-15785:}}It's good to see you, friend. I was surprised when Scruut appeared, and I hoped she would send me somewhere not quite so otherworldly, but I never hesitated. I'm happy to assist you.\n\nStill, if we can avoid those reality tears, I'd be grateful.
{{55049764-13-15782:}}Now that we have the key, let's go unlock the catacombs and find what's left of my cohort. The door is across from the barracks.
{{55049764-6-16058:}}Ah, a visitor to our fair village. Perhaps you'd like to hear about the Dawnway, the new path forward for Bosmer and Vashabar? I can tell you all about it!
{{55049764-27-15800:}}This note seems to confirm that Pelena Weatherleah had her husband killed while he was away from the estate. Did Lady Weatherleah read it first and confront Pelena with the truth? And what is Pelena left to do when cornered?
{{55049764-27-15802:}}Can you not sense it, proxy? A foreign power is loose in Hermaeus Mora's realm. Ithelia is here, somewhere.\n\nUse the Skein of Secrets and let us see if it can provide us with a trail to follow.
{{55049764-12-16247:}}Any luck finding the real fable?
{{55049764-12-16242:}}Off in search of some abstract idea of justice and truth, aren't you? The Gryphon is a one note song, over and over again. \n\nI grew tired of that tune long ago, but good luck listening through to the end.
{{55049764-12-16248:}}With my glorious tendrils, I could place the fable on the altar from all the way over here!\n\nI won't, of course. That would be no fun for you.
{{55049764-0-15849:}}It will be good to get back to Skingrad. I enjoy the outdoors as much as the next person, but this armor starts to chafe when I've been in the heat for too long.
{{55049764-0-15848:}}You won't learn anything from those scheming charlatans, that's for sure. Lost memories? Please. Children can weave better stories than that drivel. I'll say it again stranger, you should leave this place. Nothing but rotten memories.
{{55049764-0-15840:}}Welcome to the Outcast Inn! We had some difficulties recently, but we're open for business and happy to see you. Come on in and rest for a spell. And do try the Sage's Dream! It's an ethereal experience in a glass!\n\nOh, good to see you again, friend!
{{55049764-0-15847:}}I suppose all that remains is for us to wait for reinforcements to arrive. And to pay you for the assistance you rendered to us today.
{{55049764-26-15960:}}No lockpicks? First rule for outlaws and adventurers—always come prepared.
{{55049764-6-16183:}}Perhaps I could put some protection runes on the most valuable tomes.\n\nThat's still, what? A couple hundred books or so? Not like I have anything better to do.
{{55049764-10-16162:}}These Goblins are really agitated. Let's investigate the camp quickly and with as little interaction as possible. I don't want to make anything worse than it already is.
{{55049764-8-16255:}}I'm so glad we were able to overcome this little … hiccup. That first page should be enough to get you going.\n\nI just hope you'll find some clue that will lead you to the next set of wards.
{{55049764-1-16160:}}News has begun spreading through the city. That mercenary the Legion hired, the one working with Tribune Alea. I heard he took down that false Wood Elf king, Nantharion.\n\nEven his own people are cheering about his death, or so I've heard.
{{55049764-1-16161:}}Recollection? Bah! A Wood Elf is a Wood Elf! If their king is a bad guy, how can we trust anyone from Vashabar?
{{55049764-1-16162:}}Did you see that? The displays of aggression just disappeared. They're calming down. I don't know if they'll attack either of us on sight anymore. \n\nThis is impossibly exciting!
{{55049764-1-16164:}}With the king dead, Vashabar needs strong leadership to guide us through the coming storm. I can think of no one more suited than Greenspeaker Darolith.
{{55049764-1-16167:}}The signal fires … they're lit! Looks like Legionary Thania came through! But if you need something, you should talk to the captain.
{{55049764-1-16169:}}Any chance I could get you to cast a few investigation spells while you're in there, maybe learn something about this place? \n\nNever mind. Nahlia's giving me a look. Just do what she says and watch her back, got it?
{{55049764-2-16167:}}Cowards … shooting arrows from a distance. A true warrior faces their opponent up close so they can look them in the eye!
{{55049764-2-16166:}}I knew Nantharion was too good to be true! The bastard! The rot-infested, fungus filled, mite eating root poker!
{{55049764-2-16165:}}Dawnwood's sudden appearance is proof that we were meant to settle this new forest. Vashabar is only the beginning. Soon we'll have settlements throughout Dawnwood … and maybe even beyond!
{{55049764-2-16164:}}Don't believe these nasty rumors about King Nantharion. All we have to go on is the word of some city-dwelling Wood Elf and some mercenary from who knows where!
{{55049764-2-16163:}}There is much to be done. But it will be good to flex my feathers again.
{{55049764-2-16162:}}Thank the Eight! \n\nHand me the totems. The sooner I can return them to the Goblins, the sooner this mess is over.
{{55049764-2-16161:}}It's the damn Wood Elves, mark my word! Why else would they settle on this side of the Strid?
{{55049764-2-16160:}}Have you heard? The Vashabar ruler, King Nantharion, he's the leader of the Recollection!
{{55049764-6-16021:}}Like before, this path stirred up memories. I experienced the same dread before Hermaeus Mora's forces arrived.\n\nBut I did not collapse like a coward. I commanded my Shardborn to resist and they obeyed. The struggle I recall was … epic.
{{55049764-8-16009:}}This is by far the strangest journey I've ever been on. But I'm not about to turn back now.
{{55049764-3-16294:}}Please, leave me. There is no placating the heartbreak I feel.
{{55049764-3-16291:}}Are you our promised reinforcements? Not the most impressive sight I've ever seen, but if you'll raise a blade in our defense then you've got my respect.
{{55049764-3-16292:}}Speak to the baroness, I must keep my eyes trained on our attackers.
{{55049764-9-16242:}}So interesting, you are. What goes on within that mind of yours? What shapes your mind in just such a way? \n\nHmm, I suppose we will see. Place the fable upon the altar.
{{55049764-9-16248:}}No tricks to these games. When people see what you've done it will inspire joy and floating.\n\nI believe Ulfsild herself would have approved, Not-Ulfsild.
{{55049764-31-15960:}}I'd know that cloak anywhere. It was Tham's favorite. Said it made him look wealthy and successful.\n\nIt's definitely seen better days, but at least it's not covered in blood.
{{55049764-0-16189:}}Why does my Prince allow this mortal to speak with her? Hermaeus Mora and the other betrayers approach. We have no time to waste with mortal nonsense.
{{55049764-0-16184:}}Telling the Votary Commander that a magical being promoted me to steward of the Scholarium might be the strangest conversation I've ever had.\n\nBut! It went well. We're going to share this place with the world. Just like Ulfsild intended.
{{55049764-0-16183:}}I'm not easily impressed, adventurer. But you've lived up to expectations. Now that all the wings are open I'm just itching for a chance to try Scribing myself.\n\nMaybe write a paper or two. Who knows? The future looks bright, if dusty.
{{55049764-0-16182:}}I really think Nahlia's discovered her calling here in the Scholarium. Worry not, I'll back her up when she talks to the Votary Commander. \n\nThank you for your role in all of this. It's been a singular opportunity, adventurer.
{{55049764-0-16181:}}I need to protect my farm. My family! My niece, Bella, went out on her own, and now she's missing. If hiring those hunters will save her life, then I'm going to do it. \n\nEven if Pim hates me.
{{55049764-0-16180:}}I'm grateful to you and Tribune Alea. Those Recollection soldiers would've found me eventually. Only so many places to hide down there.\n\nYou're quite impressive for not being part of the Legion. I think I could learn a thing or two from you.
{{55049764-11-16005:}}The handwriting at the bottom of the note is definitely Sorilen's. Running into ruins alone is just like her.\n\nBut I didn't expect the Recollection to be here. She's heading into more danger than she realizes.
{{55049764-8-16019:}}Leramil is convinced that the Lamp, the Skein, and Abolisher have been depleted. Still, we should be safe and put them in the display case. Daedric relics shouldn't be left lying about, I don't think.
{{55049764-8-16011:}}When Vargas attacked, I saw a flash of light and suddenly I was somewhere else. It looked sort of like Fargrave, but everyone was gone—including Beragon. I wandered until I found those mirrors.\n\nThanks for getting me out of there, comrade.
{{55049764-8-16014:}}This is a marvelous opportunity. A learning experience. Now let's head back to that altar.
{{55049764-8-16017:}}Proceed, proxy. Your guess about which direction to try is as good as mine. Sooner or later, we will find an end to these corridors. And Tribune Alea, if fortune favors us.
{{55049764-10-15960:}}The entrance to the mine is on the southeast side of town. Let's go find Balandrus. It's time to put an end to the Terror of the Weald—one way or another.
{{55049764-6-15802:}}Despite the threat Ithelia poses, it was never her intention to cause the tears in fate's fabric and threaten the stability of reality. If prison is merely a stopgap, then your notion to leave this realm has merit.\n\nSee what the One Who Knows thinks.
{{55049764-7-16061:}}A new face in Vashabar! Beautiful, like the pelt of a senche-tiger cub. Fresh from the den and curious about the world.
{{55049764-7-16060:}}Traveler. Are you looking to practice the blade? In the mood for a sparring match?
{{55049764-1-16284:}}Friend, Leramil sent me to locate you. She's quite certain that we're not done with the problems of Oblivion and the destruction of reality quite yet.
{{55049764-1-16287:}}We need to get across quick as we can. If your Ulfsild-lens-sight-thing runs out we might get stuck. \n\nAnd that would be bad!
{{55049764-1-16286:}}Talk to the Crow, my friend. I have to find out how this turns out!
{{55049764-1-16281:}}Relationships do not lose their worth when they end. You can carry someone with you in other ways.\n\nBut while it lasts there's such joy in loyalty to one's friends. How will you vow to respect them?
{{55049764-1-16280:}}Kindness is like the first snow of winter. Get enough of it all at once, and soon it starts to stick.\n\nWhen I pass from this world, I'll never look back and wish I'd been less charitable. Will you vow the same?
{{55049764-1-16282:}}You have it, my sigil. Well done, inheritor. Amplify the altar, and bring this journey to an end.
{{55049764-11-15779:}}Go on, I marked the locations on your map. I'll tell Gadayn, Beragon, and Tribune Alea exactly what you need to do to restore the relics. As soon as I figure that out.\n\nDon't worry, we've got this. I think.
{{55049764-3-15768:}}It took years to negotiate a fair dowry for the Verdulis family's eldest daughter. To come this close to a life of leisure only for some flea-infested scoundrel to dash my dreams?\n\nPlease, search Fyrelight for my dowry, I beg of you.
{{55049764-25-15983:}}Whoever's behind these attacks on West Weald—Daedra, Wood Elf, or Recollection fanatic—I mean to make them answer for what they've done. This land is my home, and I'll fight to protect it.
{{55049764-4-15851:}}Our intrepid investigators! Pelena and I were just arguing over what to do with my mother's estate. Marriage squabbles. Have you made progress with that mysterious riddle? I can fetch her if you'd like, she just went into the kitchen.
{{55049764-24-15793:}}I can sometimes discern the alchemical properties of a compound by tasting it. Not the most advisable tactic, but when no other alternative presents itself ….\n\nI find myself straining against the temptation to consume this entire glass.
{{55049764-9-15785:}}Was that the last relic? I was told to meet you and Leramil in Skingrad. Scruut provided me with a way to get there, so don't wait for me.
{{55049764-0-16020:}}I must contact Hermaeus Mora and inform him that Ithelia has regained at least some of her power.\n\nDo not take this as a slight against you. Helping her saved many lives. It was the correct thing to do.
{{55049764-0-16021:}}Finally, the storm abates and I can clearly see the Many Paths. I can discern one reality from the next and my mind is clear.\n\nI am myself again. I am Ithelia, Prince of Paths and Mistress of the Untraveled Road.
{{55049764-0-16023:}}Well done! I expect we'll be on our way soon. Marriage troubles aside, I'm quite looking forward to our stay in Skingrad. I hope to make it as relaxing as I can for Master Grander.
{{55049764-11-15802:}}I sense Hermaeus Mora ahead of us, but also another, stronger presence. Since she absorbed the power of the Loom, Ithelia has become an engine of chaos and destruction. Proceed cautiously, proxy.
{{55049764-7-16269:}}These safeguards, these tasks, are a chance to right what has gone wrong. To stand against injustice. \n\nThank you mortal. I can't wait to return to the skies, to my own patrol.
{{55049764-7-16264:}}That was mortifying, I'm sorry you had to see that. I never did learn to hold my drinks.\n\nAfter all that, I would understand if you want to leave. But I could still use your help, if you're willing.
{{55049764-7-15797:}}The murderer has been apprehended and will face justice. You should speak to Aquilia about the family fortune.
{{55049764-18-16017:}}This is what Mora feared. Ithelia devised her Loom to undo fates she did not agree with. She could destroy everything we know in her desire to restore what she lost—to create a reality where she was never imprisoned and forgotten. We must stop her!
{{55049764-2-16041:}}I believe our interaction has concluded. Take your suspicions and go bother someone else.
{{55049764-2-16042:}}I do hope you'll tell Constable Yabren that Carvain Ranch has nothing to hide.
{{55049764-3-16009:}}Is that what I looked like when you found me? How strange! Hurry—use the Lamp and get our friend out of there!
{{55049764-3-16005:}}Sorilen talked about the Recollection's desire to take back Ayleid land. But based on their behavior so far, I don't think it'll be peaceful.\n\nWere you able to grab that wildburn seed from the ruins?
{{55049764-3-16003:}}We should have stayed away after Ostumir was overtaken by the forest, but we refused to leave well enough alone.
{{55049764-3-16002:}}I don't know Leramil well, but the loss of the curate has hit her hard. You should talk to Scruut and find out what we're supposed to do with the fragment we recovered.
{{55049764-12-15852:}}I'll remain here until my aunt's affairs are resolved. I won't rest easy until I know justice has been brought to her killer.
{{55049764-4-16118:}}Well done! I'll return to Beragon's townhouse. Good luck at the other locations, comrade.
{{55049764-4-16112:}}I hate to admit it but Agmund is right. Our accursed debate on the Molag Bal Paradox is what got us into this predicament.
{{55049764-13-16178:}}The Gryphon sees power as a weapon, to be pointed at those that might harm the weak. I believe you will offer him insights, new avenues of thought. Especially with the aide of his little friend.
{{55049764-13-16170:}}The echo spoke of the east wing. Heed the word of Archmage Ulfsild the Evergreen. Find the lens.
{{55049764-30-15778:}}I imagine the leaders of Skingrad and Vashabar want to thank you for saving West Weald from the Recollection and the Shardborn. Saving reality itself by destroying Ithelia's Loom probably escaped their notice.
{{55049764-1-16155:}}Look at you, the hero of West Weald! I had no idea I was asking a genuine hero for help back in Sutch.\n\nThis food, though? It has no taste! Colovians have no sense of flavor and spices. Makes me long for the cook fires of Alik'r.
{{55049764-1-16154:}}Ah, my friend! I've been hearing about your exploits beyond what we did at Valente Vineyards. You banished a forgotten Daedric Prince? How fascinating!\n\nThe arcanist also mentioned something about preserving reality, but I assume that was hyperbole.
{{55049764-27-16266:}}I can't wait until the rest of the wings are open again! I'll have so much more space to run.\n\nNot that I couldn't get into the other wings before. It's just much easier when doors are unlocked.
{{55049764-5-15847:}}I just hope another cohort can hear the tower bell. We're spread thin and who knows who's listening these days.
{{55049764-5-15840:}}Did you get lost down here? Yeah, that happens to me sometimes, too. That woman is back upstairs, sitting by the fire, so I came looking for you.\n\nI think I figured out how to make a Sage's Dream, even if we don't have the proper ingredients.
{{55049764-5-15849:}}Mind the shadows, adventurer. You never know when a wild tharriker might be lurking nearby. They might make for a good work beast, but you get on one's bad side and you'll become mighty familiar with their stinger.
{{55049764-3-16218:}}So many good legionaries died for all the wrong reasons.
{{55049764-3-16219:}}I see the knowledge of the Wilderhall has proven useful. That's pleasant.
{{55049764-18-15782:}}Groundskeeper Gaius's home is just down the hill to the east. Whether he's there or not, we need to find that key.
{{55049764-3-16217:}}Ulrath is dead … they're all dead. Did I hear that right?
{{55049764-3-16210:}}Well done getting the arcane knot out of there before things could go poorly. Good timing is either a matter of skill or luck, but Keshargo thinks you have the former. \n\nStill, he'll breathe easier knowing the knot is stabilized.
{{55049764-3-16211:}}You haven't attacked, so I'll give you one chance to answer my question. Are you one of Xoryn's or are you here to help?
{{55049764-3-16212:}}I made it out. I'm alive! I hope everyone else is all right.
{{55049764-18-15786:}}I'm glad I caught up with you! Leramil sent me out to look for you and cracked acorns if I didn't get lucky! I was afraid I was going to wander around for hours.
{{55049764-0-16279:}}You have given your vow of mystery.
{{55049764-0-16275:}}I still don't trust your friend. She seems sincere now, but I'll wait to see what my wife has to say about it.
{{55049764-0-16274:}}I don't really understand what just happened. Your friend is stranger than a tree with no roots.\n\nYou're free to go, but I'd suggest you both keep a low profile. Elelorn's patience can only be stretched so far.
{{55049764-0-16277:}}This is a test of the interaction camera system.
{{55049764-0-16276:}}With your quest done it's time for me to check in with the Guild. It'll take some time to get everything organized. \n\nDon't worry, I'll update you on my progress when I can. Just wish me luck with the Votary Commander!
{{55049764-0-16271:}}Hmph. These Wood Elves think they're so perfect, with their pretty little lives in their pretty little forest. None of them deserve it.
{{55049764-0-16270:}}What do you want with me? Are you just going to drag me back to her?
{{55049764-0-16273:}}You'll find Beragon on the road outside Ostumir, just to the north of the village. He built a small camp for the survivors. Tell him I sent you.\n\nAnd any aid you can give will be appreciated, traveler. It's rare to find much kindness in this world.
{{55049764-0-16272:}}Don't worry, you're hardly the first patron to pass out drunk in my tavern. West Weald Wallop hits harder than a guar in heat.
{{55049764-12-16118:}}When I took up the blade and shield, I never imagined battling Daedra for the fate of reality.
{{55049764-13-16035:}}You've come to the town of Ontus at an unfortunate time, traveler. I myself have only just returned. \n\nComing home to bury one's father is never an easy thing.
{{55049764-14-16005:}}Such a relief to find Sorilen safe and sound. We grew up together, you know. And though we lead very different lives, we still exchange letters from time to time. She's a good friend.\n\nLet's finish searching for other survivors before we go meet her.
{{55049764-14-16002:}}The shrine to Azura should be on the east side of the lumber camp. Let's go find it.
{{55049764-0-15968:}}Tribune Alea and Beragon await your arrival at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad. \n\nBeragon has been studying those relics you found. He seems to think they can help us defeat the Recollection, but I don't see how. We need more swords, not antiques.
{{55049764-0-15969:}}Check the locations the Skein of Secrets revealed, friend. We need to find out what Nantharion's doing out there.\n\nAnd if I'm right about another wildburn, we need to stop him before he can destroy West Weald.
{{55049764-0-15960:}}It's done. The Terror of the Weald is no longer a threat. I hope whatever remains of the gang has sense enough to scatter.\n\nI tried to do right by Sutch, getting rid of my curse. Now the place is a ghost town. And I have no idea what to do next.
{{55049764-0-15965:}}The affairs of Daedric Princes are kind of beyond my jurisdiction as a Legion tribune, but if they threaten West Weald they're going to answer to me.
{{55049764-0-15966:}}The myriad filaments of conceivability divulged … let me start again. I had a feeling you would be visiting, friend.\n\nI have been neglecting my usual studies to show Gadayn some of my favorite places in the realm—and it has been glorious!
{{55049764-10-16255:}}She sounded so sad. Losing Eyevea and the Scholarium to the whims of Sheogorath must have been devastating.\n\nAnd it sounds like the Gryphon didn't much like it either.
{{55049764-8-15985:}}Another lingering memory? We should see what the Echonir can show us here. It might be something we need to know.
{{55049764-8-15983:}}Let's keep looking. If Nantharion is still alive and somewhere in Hoperoot, we'll find him.
{{55049764-8-15981:}}Burning lights are a sure indication that someone's been here recently.\n\nKeep going, friend. The Skein already pointed us to two wildburn seeds. There might be another one below. And maybe Nantharion, too.
{{55049764-33-15793:}}Fancy meeting you here, friend! I hope you're not here for the auction at the Valente Vineyards. I'm certain the event bodes ill but I'm reluctant to enter that nest of vipers alone.\n\nWould you be willing to join me? For ample compensation or course.
{{55049764-10-15779:}}Talk to Leramil. All this thinking and planning and sensing instabilities has put me in a foul mood.
{{55049764-13-15800:}}As Mizzik suspected, the imposter may not know about Lady Weatherleah's search for Uriel. Let us keep it that way. Before we close the curtains on his performance, this one wishes to speak with Pelena about the confession's talk of tea.
{{55049764-1-16209:}}Again, you have my thanks. Hopefully we will meet again—preferably in a dark and terrifying cave. Full of scary fish. I am much better at fighting fish. Trust me.
{{55049764-1-16208:}}Sorry, friend. Can't talk much. But … thank you for saving my life. I won't waste this second chance you've given me. Not for all the gold on the Gold Road.
{{55049764-1-16205:}}What happened in the cellars was tragic. But I trust the Divines will guide Marcan Caelum's soul to the peace he was denied in life. Just as they guided us through our actions to save Valenia today.
{{55049764-1-16204:}}Back when we were in the Legion, we used to say any battle you walked away from was a victory. You'd be alive to fight again. I always felt that was a coward's boast. But after all this, I see the truth in it.
{{55049764-1-16207:}}You're back! How's Marcien? Did you find them?
{{55049764-1-16206:}}I'm glad Val's alive and kicking, but that wound's going to give her trouble the rest of her days. She deserves better than that. I need to go to Black Marsh.
{{55049764-1-16203:}}I know you have been helping Tribune Alea. I'm in no shape to charge in there after her, but maybe you can go assist her.
{{55049764-1-16202:}}See if there's a focal point anywhere. I'll start digging through these books. Only a couple hundred to go through, right?
{{55049764-11-16247:}}Let's follow the squirrels! I really do think this Netch wants to be found.
{{55049764-11-16242:}}A slightly irritated face, the smell of gas about you … you're dealing with the Netch's idea of funny, aren't you? \n\nDon't worry, if you just keep nodding along with its vacuous ramblings, eventually it stops talking.
{{55049764-2-16337:}}Those Daedra came out of nowhere!
{{55049764-2-16332:}}If you have business here, get to it. Just be aware—I'm watching you.
{{55049764-4-16217:}}It's good to see someone who still knows how to follow orders. Did you make it to the fort? Did you find my squadron?
{{55049764-2-16331:}}These are the offices of the Carvain Ranch, not a public house or waystation. If you have business here, get on with it. If you don't get out.
{{55049764-10-16118:}}Well, the little ball of eyes certainly seems flustered. Not that I've ever seen her particularly calm, mind you. I suggest you see what she wants.
{{55049764-21-16021:}}I don't know where the name comes from, or why it's clear while the rest is chaos. But the drink called Sage's Dream is important.\n\nPlease, find the answer for me.
{{55049764-3-15848:}}You are working with the investigator, I see. Don't believe a word that family says. Vultures, all of them!
{{55049764-3-15849:}}I was hired to deal with road thieves and pickpockets. I'm no beast tamer, although after this I may try to pick the skill up. It was awfully impressive. I'll leave the cave delving to you, stranger.
{{55049764-3-15840:}}Are you sure you never made a Sage's Dream before? That wasn't an easy process. But it smells wonderful. That must be some drink!
{{55049764-9-16055:}}Hey, thanks. Not every Man or Mer that comes up the road would help a couple in the middle of a family fuss.
{{55049764-5-16276:}}That sigil has been waiting a long time for us, friend. Go on. Take it.
{{55049764-15-15778:}}The ripples in the matrices of magicka are more chaotic than I expected. My portal opened farther from the Loom than I hoped.\n\nLet us make our way to the Loom. We can use the Echonir there to see if any recent memories of Ithelia remain.
{{55049764-9-16056:}}Those old mammoths should be in pod houses around the village. And don't worry if they get cranky. They're more bark than branch, if you take my meaning.\n\nWas there something else you wanted to talk about?
{{55049764-10-15802:}}Though the odds are against us, we must confront Ithelia and try to find a way to defeat her. Reality itself depends on what we do next, proxy.
{{55049764-10-15800:}}Of course, the painting of the dog is a clue! There seems to be something behind it.
{{55049764-21-16017:}}I suspect no mortal has ever set foot within the Loom of the Untraveled Road. Imagine the secrets waiting to be discovered here, if only we had the time to study it properly.
{{55049764-11-16184:}}Any luck finding what you need? Anything I can do to help?
{{55049764-25-15782:}}Look around. No people. Strange, right? I detached an entire Legion cohort to guard this estate, but I haven't found a single legionary. Not even a servant.\n\nWhat's your story? Do you know what happened to my legionaries?
{{55049764-1-16019:}}This sounds serious. Let's get the relics, friend. There's no time to waste.
{{55049764-1-16014:}}Allow me to advise. Read the epitaph very clearly. The wine we found earlier leads me to believe this place hosted a gathering of the Five Loyal Retainers. A final toast, perhaps, using the finest drink.
{{55049764-1-16015:}}Delightful to see you remain in one piece. Some of my dear Narsis's collaborators do not survive the experience. Tell me, how did you fare?
{{55049764-1-16017:}}The Loom, I see the threads all around it. It consists of portals within portals, all connected to the Many Paths. You can destroy it with Abolisher, proxy!
{{55049764-1-16010:}}The symbols the Lamp of Clarity revealed above the mirrors are the same as the ones that appear in the portal archway. There is certainly a connection.
{{55049764-1-16011:}}Back out of the stew pot and into the fire. We won't let Ithelia get away this time. Let's get those relics and head out.
{{55049764-1-16013:}}Do you feel it? The power of the Ayleids pervades this place. Millennia separate us from the Heartland High Elves, but I can feel their legacy flowing through my blood.\n \nIt pains me to see their glory buried in these ruins.
{{55049764-4-16266:}}We make a pretty good team! Not as good as Gryphon and I, but still. Not too shabby.\n\nI'm glad you're trying to restore the scholum. The scholur. Ulfsild's library.
{{55049764-4-16264:}}This Wood Elf is so angry with me. I'm sure he has reason to be. I just wish I knew what drove my vanity to such crimes.
{{55049764-4-16269:}}The Princes should cause you no trouble, if the Fox plays his role correctly. You have nothing to worry about.
{{55049764-4-16192:}}I think Pim was going to meet with my uncle. So, you might be able to find her at the family farm near Gray's Hollow. \n\nI really hope you can help this situation before things get too bad.
{{55049764-13-16248:}}Behold! My beauty! My splendor! A gift to you, Not-Ulfsild.\n\nYou have worked hard to find me. I know why, of course. I always know why. Confirm for me please, Ulfsild is gone. Yes?
{{55049764-13-16247:}}Hey there, I thought you could use some help tracking down the fable.\n\nIt seems like this Netch has a very distinct sense of humor. I'm willing to play along for now if you are.
{{55049764-13-16242:}}You've really done it, haven't you? You've gotten the others to donate their power, and the Crow has deemed you worthy. I admit to surprise, pleasant surprise.\n\nThink your way through her trials, mortal. And you'll be just fine.
{{55049764-17-15782:}}Finally, a living person. Find out what he knows and get the catacomb key. I'll keep watch, just in case.
{{55049764-3-16160:}}A forest springs out of nowhere and covers a third of the Weald and no one does anything? What's the Legion waiting for? An all-out attack on the city?
{{55049764-0-16341:}}When my sister came up that hill, I cried. She said a Wood Elf helped her, but not Beragon. We should've been better neighbors to Valenwood. Maybe then none of this would have happened.
{{55049764-0-16340:}}Looks like you and that Wood Elf saved more of the people trapped in Ostumir. We can't thank you enough.
{{55049764-0-16343:}}Go on, comrade. You'll find Beragon on the balcony off the upper level. He told me to send you up there the moment you returned.
{{55049764-0-16347:}}I trust Commander Merian with my life. If he says to stand here and hold back Daedra, that's exactly what I'll do. Let them come.
{{55049764-0-16346:}}We're under strict orders not to let any Daedra through. I promise, not a single horned monster will get past us.
{{55049764-0-16349:}}How many Daedra can there be? They seem endless!\n\nFollow Tribune Alea and hunt them down.
{{55049764-18-16005:}}Didn't get enough of me while fighting the Recollection in Grahtwood, hmm? No time to catch-up, though, friend. I have injured people here and more still in the village of Ostumir.\n\nHow about we get them out safely before the ground shakes again?
{{55049764-13-15972:}}Ithelia exiled, Torvesard defeated, but the danger to existence persists. The tears in the fabric of reality, we need to repair them!\n\nHow? I suggested a needle and thread, but my master has a different solution. So he sent me to find you. Again.
{{55049764-13-15973:}}I should've known. Scruut never seems to show up with good news, does she? Anyway, I'm ready to help wherever I'm needed.
{{55049764-6-16019:}}Hopefully, a private chat without stubborn nobles or proud treethanes around can give Calantius and Darolith the opportunity to talk frankly and be flexible in their negotiations.\n\nIf this goes well, I might have to add diplomat to my portfolio!
{{55049764-6-16011:}}Good work, comrade! I have a feeling our adversaries weren't expecting us to cut our way out of this strange prison. That means we have a chance to surprise them.\n\nThrough the portal!
{{55049764-6-16010:}}This part of Fargrave seems more familiar, but I still cannot shake the notion that this demiplane has a deeper connection to Ithelia than I ever suspected.
{{55049764-6-16017:}}The Lamp of Clarity can no longer help us. Pulling Tribune Alea out of the Many Paths used up the last of its power.\n\nWe cannot use it again in our efforts to escape this prison.
{{55049764-6-16015:}}Hello, my friend. Would you be interested in helping the great adventurer, <<1>>? He's busy exploring a nearby Ayleid ruin, and I fear for his safety.
{{55049764-6-16014:}}Go on, place the items atop the altar so we can consider our next step.
{{55049764-16-16130:}}Thank you for coming. The guild will make this worth your time, rest assured. \n\nHead through the door over there, I'll be right behind you.
{{55049764-11-16035:}}You've come to the town of Ontus at an unfortunate time, traveler. I myself have only just returned. Coming home to bury one's father is never an easy thing.
{{55049764-0-16201:}}Don't go in there unless you can fight. I thought I was handy with a blade, but I took a claw to the leg. Now I can't even limp out of here.\n\nI knew something like this was going to happen.
{{55049764-0-16107:}}I'm not sure Leftwheal can come back from this. Perhaps it's time to move on.
{{55049764-0-15941:}}You look familiar. Pretty sure I saw you talking to Quen. I keep a low profile, so you might not have noticed me.\n\nRegardless, you're here. I'm here. Listen up and you'll be richer for it.
{{55049764-4-16015:}}I can tell you a little about the area, but I'm afraid full information on the task ahead should come from <<1>> himself. Please, go seek him out.
{{55049764-4-16014:}}That carving looks important. It is some form of epitaph to the Five Loyal Retainers. I'd venture it's crucial to releasing the Emblem of the Last King.
{{55049764-4-16011:}}Nantharion's actions ensured that relations between Skingrad and Vashabar started on the brink of conflict. But you and Beragon have shown me that West Weald has room for all people. I think Count Calantius knows that now, too.
{{55049764-4-16019:}}I know the history of our world is far from perfect, but I'm glad we stopped Ithelia from changing everything that happened since the time of the Ayleids. Not even a Daedric Prince could get that right, I think.\n\nAnyway, we've earned a rest.
{{55049764-6-16257:}}Hello. I'm a legionary in the West Weald Legion. Have you had any experience tracking creatures? How would you like to perform a great service for Count Calantius of Skingrad?
{{55049764-1-16163:}}A new day dawns, Scribing returned to the world. I'm trying not to get feathers everywhere in my excitement.
{{55049764-1-16165:}}I don't believe it. King Nantharion is a good man. These malicious rumors must be the work of the Colovians. They'll do anything to be rid of us!
{{55049764-23-15793:}}I've talked to some of the guests. Certainly many vampires, and wealthy ones at that. Let's keep questioning.
{{55049764-15-16129:}}You stopped! Thank you. There are plenty of you adventuring types running around, but everyone else seemed eager to ignore me.\n\nThe Mages Guild is looking for someone with an explorer's grit to help us with a bit of a predicament.
{{55049764-10-16276:}}Maybe there's something in the tome the echoes pointed out.
{{55049764-11-16183:}}Oh no. You're going to ask me to help you with whatever that is your holding there, aren't you? It's not a riddle, is it?
{{55049764-4-16246:}}I am occasionally fond of the Netch's levity. However, if you are short on patience for playful antics, you may find this a difficult trial.\n\nWorth it, I think, on your path to master Scribing.
{{55049764-1-15969:}}See how the map shifted and those marks appeared? I'm pretty sure they indicate places where the Staff of Many Paths has been used recently. A lingering aura of sorts, maybe.\n\nI think we need to investigate these sites.
{{55049764-1-15968:}}I bring another message from my tribune, mercenary. You may wonder why an experienced and capable legionary such as myself is still relaying messages. Believe me, the question nags at me, too. Perhaps I'm being punished for some unintended offense?
{{55049764-1-15965:}}I see you found your way to this Beragon person, too, comrade. We started to compare notes about the Recollection, but then he insisted we wait for you.\n\nSo, go talk to him. I need to know what's going on.
{{55049764-1-15966:}}Our journey has reached a suitable conclusion, friend. A long rest is in order for all of us. Perhaps I can convince Curate Gadayn to join me in exploring Apocrypha. I would … like that.\n\nAs for you and me, thank you for everything.
{{55049764-1-15960:}}Please, my friend. Talk to Tham. I need to compose myself before I can comfort him.
{{55049764-4-16241:}}The Dragon's challenges were particularly taxing for Ulfsild. I hope you're not losing too many feathers dealing with her.
{{55049764-4-16242:}}With your allies at your side, seek understanding of my mind. Craft a riddle that will confound my thinking and ensure your success.
{{55049764-3-16317:}}Trust in fate, proxy. Choice and circumstance brought us to this moment. Now we must see it through.
{{55049764-3-16316:}}I know nothing about Daedric machines or magic looms, but our enemies are down there. And whatever they're planning, it can't be good for West Weald. We need to put a stop to this, comrade.
{{55049764-24-16266:}}I don't want to say anything about the Netch! It could be in here. Floating. Listening to us. Right now!
{{55049764-2-16075:}}If I hadn't been injured, I'd go back in there with you and Calvo. As it is, I'd just slow you down.
{{55049764-2-16077:}}Please keep an eye on Calvo. He's scared out of his wits, but he's determined to go back in there anyway. I suppose that's what it means to be a legionary, but I don't think I could do it.
{{55049764-2-16076:}}Good luck in there. Well, maybe Calvo needs it more than you. Divines know he's no hero.
{{55049764-2-16078:}}Step back, stranger! I am about to perform a miraculous feat of mighty spellcraft!
{{55049764-14-16206:}}Well, stranger, you're back. Let me guess: This time you're here to tell me my brother wants me to come visit his family in Stormhold! As if I'd put up with his cooking.
{{55049764-15-16248:}}Ah, the Gryphon! I hope you don't freeze up on this one. But if you do, I'll bet you can fox your way out of it.
{{55049764-15-16242:}}I continue to mull your riddle. Its simplicity and circular nature delights me, mortal. A pearl of an idea I can polish and hold up to examine again, and again.
{{55049764-19-15778:}}Both Scruut and I gleaned much from your examination of the reality tear. Since this is Scruut's area of expertise, I shall let her explain it.
{{55049764-15-16247:}}We knew there was something off about that book. But we've been searching for material to support your investigation of the Netch's wing, and this was the best we could find. \n\nAlmost like someone's keeping the real books stashed away somewhere.
{{55049764-27-15971:}}We dealt the Recollection a hard blow when we stopped Nantharion's ritual and destroyed their fortress. And we won another victory at Hoperoot nearly as important. One that may end the distrust between Skingrad and Vashabar.
{{55049764-23-15778:}}Scruut's portal appears suitable. I shall meet you on the other side, proxy.
{{55049764-5-16308:}}This place is fascinating. Simply fascinating! \n\nI'll be just a moment, adventurer. I'm still getting set up.
{{55049764-7-16182:}}Ho there, friend! I know the path of Scribing beckons. You're no doubt hoping to contact the Gryphon Luminary.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems we have a page thief in the Scholarium.
{{55049764-7-16184:}}Whatever the riddle is, I want to help. You just tell me where we need to be, and I'm there.
{{55049764-7-15985:}}That was strange. Vargas appeared and threw you into that memory with a wave of her hand! I'm glad you found your way out, comrade.\n\nI chased Vargas but she escaped me again. Let's keep going.
{{55049764-7-15987:}}With Nantharion's death at Miscarcand, any remaining Recollection forces should be in disarray. But the Mirrormoor Daedra are another matter entirely.\n\nWe need to deal with Shardmarshal Vargas to stop the incursions I suspect.
{{55049764-7-15981:}}More wildburn seeds, just as I feared! And an Echonir memory, as well. It looks like Nantharion has been busy here. Better burn those seeds and see what the Echonir reveals.
{{55049764-7-15983:}}Wait and watch, comrade. We might learn something if we practice a little patience here.
{{55049764-20-15778:}}Reality simply doesn't break down like this, proxy. Not unless …. \n\nQuickly, we must examine that tear!
{{55049764-2-16273:}}I thought perhaps we could finally return home. But not anymore. Ostumir is cursed.
{{55049764-2-16276:}}You know what? I think maybe, just maybe, my parents might be impressed with me next time I go home to visit.
{{55049764-2-16275:}}I don't care who you are, I demand justice for my wife!
{{55049764-2-16274:}}Don't make me regret this.
{{55049764-1-16353:}}I helped build that barricade, so you know it's strong. And if they knock it down again, I'll put it back even stronger. I can do this all day.
{{55049764-1-16352:}}No one will get past the gate. That I can promise. That barricade is strong and my blade is sharp.\n\nYou just do whatever the commander orders and we'll do the same.
{{55049764-1-16351:}}I never wanted to join the Imperial Legion. My father forced me. Now look! I'm about to die from a Daedric blade.\n\nSome people see honor in dying from combat. I just see death!
{{55049764-1-16350:}}I've served under Commander Merian for ten years. He's tough on us, but I know he cares. The stronger we are, the more we can handle.
{{55049764-24-15960:}}You talk to her while I keep watch. I got along with Tham and a few other townsfolk, but most were wary once they figured out what I was back then.
{{55049764-14-15983:}}If we had taken a little longer to get here, that wildburn seed would have … what? Sprouted? Exploded? Whatever you call it, it would have been just like Ostumir. The beginning of another new forest!\n\nTalk to Beragon while I deal with my rage.
{{55049764-17-16266:}}Welcome to the Wing of the Gryphon! As you can see, the Gryphon himself isn't quite ready to talk just yet.\n\nI've kept him company ever since the library disappeared. I'm not sure if he can hear me in there? But I talk to him every day.
{{55049764-8-16162:}}Goblins are highly territorial, that's why the Sharp Tooth camp is a little ways away from this Bitterfish Goblin camp. Still, they're nearer than most other Goblin tribes, and that makes for interesting research. \n\nYou'll see what I mean.
{{55049764-20-15983:}}I'm not sure what to make of everything the greenspeaker told you. Dawnway, Green Pact, wildburn … sounds like a lot of words that tell us absolutely nothing.\n\nYou'd better talk to Beragon and see if he can make any sense of all this.
{{55049764-1-16118:}}Hmm. Something … something … I'm sure I'm forgetting something ….\n\nNo matter. I think Curate Gadayn wishes to speak with you, comrade.
{{55049764-1-16111:}}I'm very eager to get moving. West Weald wine accompanies cosmic theories the best!
{{55049764-1-16112:}}So do you now have a good grasp on the complexity of this paradox?
{{55049764-8-16204:}}Breaking down doors is Big Urm's specialty, but it looks like she'll need a moment to find her rhythm. See if you can find anything Marcan Caelum left here while she's busy with the door. Maybe it will help.
{{55049764-8-16205:}}Arkay forgive me, it was like a spirit was among us. We split up just for a moment, and suddenly I heard Val scream.\n\nFallen-Knives feels responsible, but I should have said something. I just stood there like a statue.
{{55049764-8-16206:}}Sneaky tzilnech! I took a good swig to steady my nerves, and this is the brilliant idea I came up with? We should have stuck together.\n\nLead the way. We can't leave Val alone with that monster.
{{55049764-8-16208:}}Merchants make the journey to Skingrad regularly for supplies. I'll join one of their caravans and travel as part of a group. See you at the Outlaws Refuge.
{{55049764-5-16130:}}A talking crow? This just gets weirder and weirder! I suppose you'd better do what she says.
{{55049764-2-15993:}}Arkay smiles upon you, friend. Your assistance in stopping the ritual has finally put the spirits of Nonungalo to rest. You saved both the living and the dead of West Weald today.
{{55049764-2-15991:}}An ominous letter and a map with notes in code? I have some experience with that sort of thing from my days as an Imperial scribe. Pack those up and take them with you, friend. I'll see if I can puzzle out the code later.
{{55049764-2-15997:}}One of these days, Tribune Alea is going to realize she's wasting me on messenger duty. I'm strong, I'm fearless, and my sword arm strikes true!\n\nI should be back in the thick of battle, not passing messages back and forth.
{{55049764-2-15996:}}I'm glad to see Tribune Alea, but she certainly took her sweet time! We've had all sorts of problems here!\n\nDid you bring reinforcements? Captain Leronus sent the remaining legionaries and staff into the catacombs. Then he was going to call for help.
{{55049764-2-15998:}}Proceed to Wendir, the spot marked on the Skein of Secrets. I shall meet you there and together we shall discover what the Skein wants us to know.
{{55049764-13-12452:}}You should speak with Shelaria. I'm afraid she'll have nothing to do with me for now.
{{55049764-12-15785:}}As luck would have it, Scruut knows of a ship here in Fathoms Drift called Stormspinner. It was carrying items sacred to followers of Mephala and she thinks you can use them to restore the relic.\n\nThe ship should be to the north. Let's go find it.
{{55049764-32-15793:}}First, let's look around the vineyard. I want to examine the grapes they grow here. Besides, it's a good idea to get a feel for the grounds before we head into the auction.\n\nNever fear. This is exactly what House Ravenwatch trained me for.
{{55049764-0-16150:}}Have you ever had a thought suddenly slip away? It's frustrating. Like trying to grasp an eel with an oven mitt.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad I was able to attend this quaint gathering and show Skingrad's appreciation for all you've done.
{{55049764-0-16151:}}Now that the celebration is done, I hope Count Calantius and I can resolve any remaining points of contention in our negotiations. Vashabar truly desires peace with Skingrad and the Weald.\n\nThere was something else I meant to ask, but it escapes me.
{{55049764-0-16152:}}Deputy. Good to see you. I'm surprised you didn't ask for a larger salary, considering what I now know of your reputation.\n\nI'm glad to see you were able to help all of West Weald, not just solve my problems in Ontus.
{{55049764-0-16153:}}Hello, walker. One does not need to be as perceptive as Mizzik Thunderboots to see all the good you have done for West Weald. And such an impressive list of guests!\n\nMizzik hopes to someday be worthy of a gala such as this.
{{55049764-0-16154:}}An excellent celebration, my friend! I knew you were amazing after witnessing your exploits at the vineyard, but saving the entire West Weald? Extraordinary!\n\nThere was something else I meant to ask you, but I lost the thought. Ah, well.
{{55049764-0-16155:}}The Wood Elf had some nice things to say about you. I even heard the count sing your praises! Someday you must tell me the story of what you did besides end the Terror.\n\nAnyway, I'm not the sort to say this lightly. I'm proud to call you my friend.
{{55049764-0-16156:}}I've thrown a wild bit of merry making a time or two at my place in Sutch, but nothing like this! The count of Skingrad is here, for Ruptga's sake!\n\nI can't believe with everything else you accomplished, you had time to help me.
{{55049764-10-16130:}}It's been a while since I've had to charge in blind and hope for the best. \n\nI'm ready if you are.
{{55049764-7-16035:}}Deputy. Were you able to interview the townsfolk I suggested?
{{55049764-16-16206:}}I have to say, you're the first stranger I met who was willing to pay off my bar tab. Well, there was that trapper in White Rose, but it turns out—you know what? That's a story for another time.
{{55049764-16-16204:}}Naku's as stubborn as a stump. But if you got Knives to part with his drink—however briefly—and come here, then this shouldn't be too hard.\n\nWe'll keep looking for leads on the murderer while you're gone.
{{55049764-16-16205:}}The Imperial Legion gave me that ring back when I served as a proud member of the Scarlets. It ordained me as chaplain of the squad. The ring is proof before the Divines of who I once was. I can't bear to lose it.
{{55049764-2-16387:}}< The scamp glances up from arranging her wares before returning to her work.>
{{55049764-9-15991:}}When we talk to King Nantharion, you take the lead. Tribune Alea is just as likely to start a war as an argument, and Vashabar isn't quite sure what to make of me. You, on the other hand, are an unknown quantity. That could work in our favor.
{{55049764-9-15993:}}I found a journal among the necromancer's things. It revealed how the ritual began. Interrupting their spell should subdue the spirits and put an end to their plot. Read the journal, but be wary. Whatever killed the necromancers may still be inside.
{{55049764-26-15782:}}Colovians have grown familiar with conflict. These last few years hardened us. We'll deal with whatever trouble comes our way.
{{55049764-4-16144:}}Hermaeus Mora's plan seems cruel, even for a Daedric Prince. Imprisoned, forgotten for an eternity. It is an unspeakable punishment that I cannot allow to stand!
{{55049764-13-15802:}}The Skein showed us that the Mirrormoor wards are on the upper level. We must destroy them to reach Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum. Let us find a way to ascend, proxy.
{{55049764-6-16125:}}After all my good works, they still come for me. What does Mora see that I do not?
{{55049764-21-15793:}}I see vampires and mortal servants, but no obvious guards. I wonder where Valente is hiding them?
{{55049764-6-16129:}}Everyone keeps talking about these odd things happening to them. They're saying it's this Netch Luminary. Funny enough though, nothing's happened to me.\n\nWait. Does that mean the Netch doesn't like me?
{{55049764-4-15768:}}Julianos be praised, a friendly face. It seems the roads are far more dangerous than I was led to believe. We stopped to enjoy the breeze when a crazed brigand came out of nowhere and robbed us!
{{55049764-16-16043:}}The commander gave you some critical tasks. You need to hurry.\n\nDon't worry about taking your eye off the enemy. I have your back, comrade.
{{55049764-1-15848:}}The estate feels hollow now without her. And apologies for my appearance. Needed some liquid courage to walk the halls of this corpse. I hope you find who did this. She didn't deserve what happened to her.
{{55049764-1-15849:}}Nice work, dealing with that thief. I probably could have chased her down myself, but you should have heard the way Grander was yowling. Like a pup with a thorn between his paws.
{{55049764-1-15840:}}You did it! That strange woman has left and taken the shadows with her!\n\nTime to start running a regular inn again. Maybe I'll add the Sage's Dream to the menu. Provided I can get some more of those ingredients!
{{55049764-23-15802:}}Hermeaus Mora opened a portal to the Mythos. We must hurry and reach his side. Who knows what damage Ithelia and Torvesard can cause at the core of Apocrypha.
{{55049764-1-15847:}}From the sound of the bell, I assume your mission was successful, soldier. Were you able to recover the cohort's payroll as well? And where's Legionary Calvo?
{{55049764-3-16056:}}My brother looks furious. Good! I can't wait to see what happens.
{{55049764-3-16057:}}You again. My sister's co-conspirator. Well, spit it out! Tell me what's going on here.
{{55049764-3-16054:}}Almost time. Damn. Arse. Rut it all.
{{55049764-3-16055:}}I'm ready to do this. Nervous, but ready.
{{55049764-3-16051:}}Follow Tribune Alea into the barracks! Find out where the Daedra are coming from. Go!
{{55049764-4-15864:}}Hmm. The threads of fate reveal nothing to me—I cannot perceive them here. But the Daedric power I sensed outside is even stronger now. I am sure there must be a shrine below. We must press on.
{{55049764-3-16058:}}I'm not sure why we're all gathered here, but it must be for something important.
{{55049764-4-16162:}}My last publication was on the past major Goblin wars. What started them, the factors and variables that drove all these different Goblin tribes to war.\n\nJerntann is recreating the exact conditions of Bone Cliff Battle!
{{55049764-9-15793:}}Splash them through the bars, quickly! The counteragent can be administered topically and this is the safest way. For us and for them.
{{55049764-13-15778:}}We must observe this memory, proxy.
{{55049764-13-15779:}}The instability is a reality tear! I hate being right all the time. We need to learn all we can, so go take a look.\n\nBut do be careful. Nonexistence probably isn't a pleasant experience.
{{55049764-12-16210:}}This one wishes he had good tidings and something more welcoming than a simple fire. The Lucent Citadel is supposed to be empty. If Keshargo knew we would be attacked, he would have hired warriors. Now he must hire who he can.
{{55049764-0-15896:}}Come join a righteous cause, my friend! The Aldmeri Dominion has room for everyone in its ranks!
{{55049764-10-16014:}}Let me see those papers we gathered. I see. The Recollection found an altar, but could go no farther. Sounds magical. There's mention of finding vials of blood, some sacred water and a bottle of ancient wine. Yes. Yes! Those are our keys.
{{55049764-10-16017:}}Beragon must have found his way through the Many Paths to this concurrent spot between realities. I think we can help him escape. Illuminate the mirror with the Lamp of Clarity and let us hope it reveals the path we all seek.
{{55049764-10-16011:}}I can see the Legion is going to have to clean up these ruins … later. Right now the mission is to find Shardmarshal Vargas, wherever she's hiding. Open a portal with Abolisher, comrade. I'm right behind you.
{{55049764-10-16010:}}Whether Ithelia remains in Fargrave or simply passed through on her way to some other plane, our path is clear. We must explore these ruins and see what we discover.
{{55049764-0-15799:}}Finally, it's Sir Klauser's turn. He's a funny little badger, and mostly likes to roll around in the dirt.
{{55049764-0-15798:}}The estate and its fortune are left to Betu and me? I've always thought that Lady Weatherleah's generosity was unrivaled, but this …. It's almost too much.\n\nI assure you, I'll see to all of Betu's needs. We're family after all.
{{55049764-0-15793:}}I suppose you're off on another adventure now, friend. Know that I appreciate the assistance you provided. And the companionship. If you ever have need of House Ravenwatch, just send word. We always have time for our friends.
{{55049764-0-15792:}}I'll make sure the West Weald Legion Command hears about the bravery both you and my fallen soldier displayed here today. We'll reclaim Varen's Watch from the Recollection. It's only a matter of time.
{{55049764-0-15791:}}A wandering adventurer? You're exactly what I'm looking for. The West Weald Legion is in sore need of anyone who has the courage, skill, and determination to deal with a dire threat.
{{55049764-0-15797:}}With the will secured, Lady Weatherleah's family will no doubt want to get to the bottom of her absent fortune. This one will need your help to sniff out the hawk amongst the hens.
{{55049764-0-15796:}}I don't understand. My brother can't be dead. He just got the lumber camp up and running. He's supposed to return here at the end of the season to meet with more buyers. \n\nI won't believe it. I don't know you. There isn't even proof!
{{55049764-0-15795:}}What Lord Gallio was doing, his father must be rolling in his grave! Dro'vir has agreed to stay on and work for Lady Valente. Destroy these vile grapes and plant our usual seeds.\n\nCan the vineyard be salvaged? This one hopes so.
{{55049764-8-16286:}}Do you need my help with something?
{{55049764-2-16130:}}I've never seen anything like this place. Once the adepts get wind of what's down here they'll be lining up to begin their studies.
{{55049764-3-15971:}}It's hard to believe that slip of cloth is a Daedric artifact. But then again, Mephala is said to be one of the more subtle Daedric Princes. We better take it and go before the Recollection realizes we're down here.
{{55049764-3-15972:}}Take the portal when you're ready, mortal. Hermaeus Mora awaits you.
{{55049764-3-15973:}}Speak with Leramil. I'll wait for my speech after that.
{{55049764-3-15975:}}With Nantharion dead and Ithelia back in her own realm, the Recollection have scattered. Still, I'm worried about Shardmarshal Vargas and her Prince. We didn't beat them. They just … left.
{{55049764-3-15978:}}<<<1>> gibbers happily.>
{{55049764-9-16210:}}Xoryn cut off the route to the upper levels of the citadel. But, we can always search the sunken ruins.\n\nAnd—if the maps are accurate—there is a route from the ruins up to the ramparts. We won't be cut off for long.
{{55049764-0-16222:}}Beragon awaits your timely arrival at his townhouse in Skingrad. Good hunting, mercenary.
{{55049764-0-16221:}}If you're hearing this, it means you've found my false book. Cleverly done! And I'm glad to see you're putting the True-Sight Lens to good use. Even if I'm not literally there to see it.
{{55049764-0-16229:}}By the Silvenar, <<1>> is quite the handsome human. I could listen to him speak for hours.
{{55049764-15-16005:}}I can't tell you how relieved I feel to find Sorilen safe and sound. I'm not surprised that she'd stay to help survivors.\n\nLet's talk to her. Maybe she'll explain her invitation to come here.
{{55049764-6-15806:}}I believe we are done here. Let Fennorian know I wish a moment of his time. And tell him it has nothing to do with hurt feelings or a broken heart. I am above such petty concerns.
{{55049764-6-15800:}}We must study the scene carefully. Look for anything that seems out of place. This one's whiskers are already trembling with excitement. Or, perhaps it is the dust?
{{55049764-13-15840:}}Yes, uh, please come in. Stay for a while. Just pay no mind to the crack in the sky outside or those … shadows? Ignore them and have a drink.\n\nAll right, I can't ignore them either. It all started when the woman at the table by the fire came in.
{{55049764-8-16043:}}No time to talk. We need to defeat these Shardborn and secure the blade that Vargas dropped!
{{55049764-29-15778:}}Look about you, proxy. West Weald is safe. I played only a small part in setting things right—the true credit belongs to you and Beragon.\n\nYou should speak with him before you continue your journey.
{{55049764-6-16163:}}The east wing should still have a replacement crystal boxed up somewhere. \n\nDon't let the Scholarium's defenses stand in your way. Hurry now.
{{55049764-6-16162:}}The voice is coming from over there. \n\nI hope it's not who I think it is. Bella shouldn't be here. The Sharp Tooth Goblins are in a dangerous mood, and she sounded way too close.
{{55049764-12-16021:}}I see how my reflection opened a path and I understand. The Many Paths are mine to control. Perhaps I open a doorway next time.\n\nLet us return to our reality, mortal.
{{55049764-3-16164:}}Dawnwood is magnificent, but what do you make of the devastated region along the border? The greenspeakers have been studying it, but so far they have no answers.
{{55049764-18-15793:}}Don't worry. We can talk more later. In the meantime, go and search Lord Valente's office. He must have one inside the manor.
{{55049764-12-15991:}}Here. Just to be safe, you should carry the wildburn seed. Greenspeaker Darolith in Vashabar should be able to tell us something about it. Just follow the Gold Road into Dawnwood and turn north. Tribune Alea and I will meet you there.
{{55049764-1-16256:}}I name you ally of Skingrad, traveler. You will always be welcome in our fair city.
{{55049764-1-16257:}}You…you found him! Great work!
{{55049764-1-16254:}}The Fox was able to leave the Gryphon's side at any time, but I wonder how much he did. You've done a kind deed today.
{{55049764-1-16255:}}These constructs are so powerful, you can practically see the magicka radiating off of them. Eye-opening, incredible. \n\nJust like my time with you, my friend.
{{55049764-1-16250:}}I don't know how to express my gratitude. If he wasn't able to reconcile with his father, I know my Elic would have carried that sorrow with him for the rest of his days.
{{55049764-1-16251:}}Elic is here. If my last breath was an apology to him, it would have been worth it. But I have a few more left in me. And ears to listen.\n\nThank you, stranger, for guiding my spirit back to my boy.
{{55049764-12-16130:}}Now that we have a moment, allow me to introduce myself. Nahlia, Votary knight in the Order of the Lamp. \n\nI know of your impressive work for the guild, of course. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Irnard briefed you on our situation?
{{55049764-2-16304:}}Strange times here in the Weald. Makes me glad that I'm part of the Legion. I can't imagine trying to deal with these headaches on my own.
{{55049764-2-16302:}}Damn Wood Elf won't tell us a thing! If the captain let's me, I can make her talk!
{{55049764-34-15960:}}If you're reckless enough to stand with me against Balandrus's gang, who am I to say no?\n\nLet's make our way to the tavern at the center of town. An old friend, Tham, owns the place. I want to find out what happened to him.
{{55049764-9-16021:}}The Ithelia of this realty cannot even stand. She looks fully defeated, but I do not see any signs of an enemy.\n\nMaybe she can tell you what happened here. And make sure to ask about an ingredient for Sage's Dream.
{{55049764-12-15960:}}Rosalyn said we could use components in her shop to create an explosive. Look for alchemical oil and combustion canisters.\n\nJust don't put them together until we're ready to use them.
{{55049764-20-16017:}}Incredible. I thought the portal from Fargrave would take us to some Daedric apparatus. But it appears the Loom of the Untraveled Road is a place, not a machine.\n\nCome, proxy. Ithelia and Shardmarshal Vargas must be here somewhere.
{{55049764-0-16055:}}I can't tell you the last time I've seen Laeni smile like that. Thank you, traveler. You've changed our lives.
{{55049764-0-16054:}}Clen, we'd better get a drink. Otherwise the rotmeth will be gone and we'll have to carry our fathers home.
{{55049764-0-16057:}}Belwelas has always tried to teach us to listen when the Singer tells a tale. \n\nPerhaps this … situation will be good for the village.
{{55049764-0-16056:}}To think this all started with shouting and a traveler walking in from the wilds. Hah! Just look at what you've done for this village.
{{55049764-0-16051:}}We still have some Daedra stragglers to round up, but my legionaries can handle them. Feel free to take three or four down on your way out, if you're so inclined.\n\nAnd mercenary … thank you.
{{55049764-0-16059:}}Some of the Recollection who attacked our camp went into the door in the hillside, just over there. They haven't come out while I've been here.
{{55049764-0-16058:}}I'm going to look at this the way I think our ancestors might have. What seems today like the end of a tale might in fact be the start of a new one.
{{55049764-12-16183:}}I won't lie. I was envious that you had first rights to exploring this place with Nahlia. To restoring the altar. Especially after seeing how much she's opened up with you around.\n\nNow that I know it involves riddles? Not so much.
{{55049764-12-16182:}}I've never seen a Dragon myself, but I've seen the damage they can cause.\n\nPity they can't all have an appetite for riddles over destruction, like in that fable.
{{55049764-12-16184:}}What happens next is up to you, be it Gryphon, Netch, or Dragon. We've gathered their fables in the main hall.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know. Except for what's beyond the unmarked door.
{{55049764-16-15983:}}You were in there for a while. What did Nantharion have to say?
{{55049764-7-16170:}}Ah, what a flight! I almost didn't want to land. But, to business. \n\nThe Luminaries are beings of great power. Each has a domain they have shaped to their choosing. Each domain has a door and each door, of course, has a key.
{{55049764-7-16178:}}Other Luminaries see themselves as shields, or thieves. I am a blade. No more, no less. To wield power you must have this clarity of purpose.\n\nBut as you seek that clarity, you will have questions. Mortals always do.
{{55049764-5-16045:}}Clearly, defending Feldagard Keep is important. But if Ithelia visited the Outcast Inn, we must investigate. Besides, I sense a strange convergence of threads of fate there.\n\nYou must choose, proxy. I shall meet you at the inn when you arrive.
{{55049764-5-16043:}}Remind me never to leap into strange portals again. Is it normal to feel queasy?\n\nIt looks like Commander Merian wants to speak with us. You talk to him while I concentrate on not losing my lunch.
{{55049764-5-16042:}}We provide meat and produce to the entire Weald. Finest in the land. Ontus would be nothing without my ranch.
{{55049764-5-16041:}}I am an actual Colovian noble. Received my title and land from Emperor Leovic himself!
{{55049764-23-15782:}}I hereby designate you a temporary agent of the West Weald Legion. Just until we find my soldiers. We'll search the manor house first. I'll meet you inside.\n\nKeep your eyes open, comrade. We don't know what happened here.
{{55049764-11-15991:}}That was exactly the wrong approach to take with Greenspeaker Darolith.\n\nI'll try to calm Tribune Alea down. You talk to the greenspeaker and see if she can tell us anything about the wildburn seed.
{{55049764-11-15993:}}Necromancy is a scourge. It must be eradicated.
{{55049764-4-16251:}}I'm at the end, aren't I? Dragon Bridge. My blood warmed the icy water. I should have died that day.\n\nMaybe I did. Marielle. Blackberry mead. Borderwatch. Elic, my life's pride. Were all those warm memories just the dreams of a dying young soldier?
{{55049764-4-16250:}}I know this is a public clinic, but unless you're here to help, I'd ask that you leave my husband in peace.
{{55049764-5-15768:}}Be wary, traveler. A pack of tharriker stalks these woods. A ghastly sight, I assure you. Gnashing teeth and oily fur. My knees wobble at the very thought of them.
{{55049764-28-15778:}}Savor this moment, proxy. In saving West Weald from Ithelia's servants and destroying her Loom, you won a great victory. But I foresee this respite will not last long.\n\nNow, I believe Beragon is waiting to thank you.
{{55049764-19-15802:}}Is Ithelia purposely obscuring the path? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Either way, the Lamp of Clarity should reveal the way forward.
{{55049764-3-16019:}}Thanks to you, things can begin to return to normal in West Weald. I know Ithelia and Torvesard are still out there, but we can worry about that later, right?\n\nFor now, I just want to sleep for a week!
{{55049764-7-16266:}}I know this place doesn't look all that bookish, but Hermaeus Mora is actually digging around here somewhere below us!\n\nNever mind that. What's important is we're here because Apocrypha is close. So close I can smell the ink!
{{55049764-6-16045:}}Beragon has told me some of what occurred at Vashabar and Hoperoot. I am eager to hear more, but first you should speak with him. We are at a crossroads and must choose our path wisely or we shall court disaster.
{{55049764-6-16043:}}It seemed like she sliced the air to open a portal. I don't know a thing about magic so I can't advise you on how to use Abolisher.\n\nMaybe just think real hard about the keep when you make the cut? Couldn't hurt.
{{55049764-4-15983:}}You're clear, comrade! Go destroy that seed!
{{55049764-4-15981:}}I noticed the Ayleid ruins around Vashabar, but I never imagined it was built above ancient Miscarcand. Clearly, Nantharion planned to harness the Well of Miscarcand from the beginning. But he needed Ithelia's help to reach it.
{{55049764-4-15987:}}I sent word to Vashabar about Nantharion's fate, and Tribune Alea's scouts report that the Recollection's on the run. However, the Daedric incursions from Mirrormoor continue unabated. I don't think Shardmarshal Vargas is done with us yet.
{{55049764-4-15984:}}We learned how to close Mirrormoor portals using Abolisher, and we caught up with Tribune Alea. Ask her if she knows where we can find Nantharion and Ithelia.
{{55049764-3-16017:}}We must get below and attempt to stop the Loom from reweaving history. I do not think we can do much against Ithelia directly, but perhaps we can find a way to damage or destroy the Loom.
{{55049764-3-16269:}}I sense you return with treasures of fire, ink, and shadow. Though, to be fair, the Fox spoiled the surprise. He was quite giddy upon his return.\n\nWell done. These stolen magics will allow me to secure the Scholarium.
{{55049764-3-16264:}}Please, speak with my vanity. I know she can be unpleasant, but we need to find out what happened here.
{{55049764-3-16266:}}What are you waiting for? Take that shiny, shiny sigil. You've earned it!
{{55049764-4-16043:}}You didn't hesitate to leap through the portal after me. You do this sort of thing pretty regularly, don't you?\n\nShardmarshal Vargas got away, though. That's on me. I swear I'll get her next time. But that place. The sky looked like cracked glass.
{{55049764-4-16041:}}Fine. Lock us in irons and take us to the magistrate. I'll accept whatever punishment they decide.
{{55049764-6-16282:}}Welcome to my roost, to the Wing of the Crow. I am a Luminary just like the others. Though I'm the youngest of our number by far.\n\nRight now, my fable lacks a fitting end. I hope that you and Nahlia can change that.
{{55049764-6-16286:}}Let's press ahead. I've read and heard so much about this place, being able to walk the Labyrinthian, even a version of the Labyrinthian, is damned inspiring.
{{55049764-4-16206:}}Thank you for what you did back there. It's my fault Caelum got his hands on Val and hurt her. Me and my drunken ideas about splitting up. \n\nI need to tend Val's wounds. Can't just drink my way through this one.
{{55049764-4-16208:}}I'm sorry you had to see Naku struck down like that. If I hadn't been so distant, then maybe we would have come together to meet this threat sooner.\n\nPlease make sure Hooke doesn't do anything he will regret at Caelum Vineyard.
{{55049764-5-15960:}}That takes care of the bloodfiend dens. But were those vampires lying about Tham? Damn it, I never wanted anyone to get hurt when I decided to leave the gang and throw off my curse!\n\nCome on. Let's find Balandrus's lair and finish this.
{{55049764-5-15966:}}I am still attempting to discern the meaning of the wisdom Ithelia shared with me, but Beragon insisted that this celebration go on. I found myself unable to refuse him.\n\nI admit that I usually avoid such festivities, but this is pleasant enough.
{{55049764-0-15999:}}It was awful! Like the world ripped open … like a tear!\n\nIt swallowed our cart and poor Lazlus … sucked them right in!
{{55049764-0-15998:}}The Skein of Secrets did not lead us astray. If I am not mistaken, Ithelia and her servant Vargas recently used this portal that you have graciously reopened.\n\nWe must follow them.
{{55049764-0-15991:}}I'm something of an expert in codes and ciphers. Whatever message is hidden in the map we found, I'll figure it out. But I'll need some things back at my townhouse for that.\n\nI'll see you in Skingrad, my friend.
{{55049764-0-15993:}}Remember, life has no meaning without death. That is why the church of Arkay rejects all forms of necromancy.\n\nWe did good work here, but I am ready to return to my duties. I have always found life more orderly within the church than outside it.
{{55049764-0-15997:}}Maybe when you get to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad, this time you can put in a good word for me with the tribune. Let her know you think I'm hale and hardy and ready to return to real duty.\n\nThe Legion needs my sword!
{{55049764-0-15996:}}I know Rustwall's grounds like the back of my hand. That map shows right where I hid the key.\n\nI'll stay here and continue to watch, just like Captain Leronus told me to do.
{{55049764-17-16021:}}That hated lamp reacted to your touch. It revealed that cluster of lights by this wall. Once again, I feel recognition, but not clarity. I sense the Many Paths, and this is a signpost.\n\nShine the lamp's light there. Show us what it does.
{{55049764-14-15840:}}I just wanted a nice inn where I could serve normal customers. Instead, I got a mysterious woman, wandering shadow people, and cracks in the sky.
{{55049764-5-16282:}}Adventurer, welcome to the end. You've overcome innumerable challenges, and you stand poised to fulfill the legacy left behind by Ulfsild all those years ago. \n\nYou are the inheritor of the Scholarium.
{{55049764-2-16023:}}I hope you have good news for Master Grander. This whole ordeal has had such a profound and distressing effect on the young lord.
{{55049764-2-16020:}}This threat to reality is over because of your actions. Very unexpected that such danger would appear in a simple inn.\n\nI would like to examine the Lamp of Clarity further. It may help in our future efforts to locate Ithelia. May I have it?
{{55049764-2-16021:}}If you have the ingredient we came for, then we need to go. Now.
{{55049764-15-16276:}}That unmarked door unlocked after you completed your last trial. Maybe the Crow knows something about it. We're nearing the end, my friend!
{{55049764-14-15786:}}The entrance to Boethiah's forge should be somewhere in the northeast section of the mine.
{{55049764-14-15782:}}I'm pretty sure that's the statue Gaius marked on his map.\n\nSearch around it for any place he could have hidden the catacombs key. Maybe a secret compartment.
{{55049764-4-15840:}}No one ever wanted to try one of my experimental drinks before. All they ever ordered was mead or ale. Now I can finally put this apparatus to the test!\n\nJust follow along with my instructions. We'll make a great drink.
{{55049764-20-16021:}}Thoughts keep swirling through my mind. They move too fast to grasp. So confused, so lost.\n\nOnly one phrase makes sense. Sage's Dream.
{{55049764-4-16129:}}I'm glad we got the pest problem from earlier sorted. Llaren and Julian had me crawling under the most awful and dusty places looking for rats, spiders, you name it.\n\nNo more of that, thank you very much.
{{55049764-23-16021:}}I don't know if you can understand me. My mind is a storm of images and voices and memories. I can see every reality all at once—the Many Paths. But my grip on this realm keeps slipping.\n\nBut you, I see that you are real.
{{55049764-1-16067:}}Ah, my friend!  Would you believe it, you are speaking to the new Jester of Skingrad! Count Calantius was delighted by my performance. Or maybe amused is a better word. Hard to read him, really.
{{55049764-1-16061:}}A beautiful ceremony. Like a … oh, a metaphor escapes me. It was so nice.
{{55049764-1-16060:}}That was beautiful. Let's get drunk on Ciiril's best and dance until dawn. Praise the ancestors!
{{55049764-1-16062:}}An exquisite execution of the rite. The ancients of Valenwood would be proud.
{{55049764-2-16222:}}Mercenary, Tribune Alea requests your presence. Immediately, if not sooner, I might add.
{{55049764-9-15856:}}I greet you, chosen of fate. Hermaeus Mora calls upon you to defend this world and all of reality. A secret contained for ages is now free. Where the once-forgotten Prince walks, disturbance and disorder follow.\n\nAnd that is how we will find her.
{{55049764-5-15983:}}Come on, let's deal with the greenspeaker and her pets as quickly as we can.
{{55049764-5-15981:}}Take another look at the Skein of Secrets. If Ithelia exerts her power at Miscarcand, the map should show us the location.
{{55049764-5-15987:}}A few Recollection may linger, but their threat fades. Without Nantharion or the Staff of Many Paths, there will be no more wildburns. The mad dream of a new Ayleid kingdom replacing West Weald is dead.\n\nAnd that wasn't our only victory, friend.
{{55049764-5-15985:}}Interesting. Was that the moment Hermaeus Mora finally crushed Ithelia's defenders? Is that what caused Miscarcand to fall?\n\nThe memory showed Ithelia's servants guarding the passage to the north. Let's see where it leads, comrade.
{{55049764-5-15984:}}Miscarcand was described as big and important, but these ruins are far more impressive than I anticipated. We need to move quickly if we're going to find Nantharion in time.
{{55049764-13-16182:}}Quite the adventure we're on together, eh? I hear Nahlia's conversation with Archmage Galerion went surprisingly well. \n\nDon't take my word for it though. She'll have much to say on the matter, I'm sure.
{{55049764-1-16304:}}A moment, traveler. A detachment of legionaries should be roaming the grounds of Rustwall. We came to meet them, but we can't find a soul. No legionaries, no servants. Not even a gardener.\n\nI'm at a loss as to what has become of them.
{{55049764-1-16305:}}Hurry, mortal. Go to Beragon's. Talk to Leramil. If we're going to preserve reality, we have to do it quickly. Soon there won't be anyplace to keep our stuff. Or us. Or anything.\n\nNothing frightens an immortal more than the threat of nonexistence.
{{55049764-1-16302:}}Halt. We're practically at war here. You can't just wander into our camp unannounced! Go! Talk to the captain this instant!
{{55049764-1-16303:}}You help them? Traitor! You aren't worthy of our great heritage.
{{55049764-1-16309:}}Keshargo needs water, but where is this one supposed to find it? There is nothing but sand and rock here. We used all the clean water we had putting out the tent fires.
{{55049764-12-15840:}}The well's out back in the courtyard. Bring me a bucket of water and I'll mix up a Skyrim Sunrise. That should get her talking.\n\nThen I can ask her to move along and take this strangeness with her. She's scaring my customers.
{{55049764-0-16312:}}I heard that you finished what we started. That's a relief.
{{55049764-0-16313:}}I saw you put the knot into the null arca.\n\nGuess that means I can stop sharpening this axe soon.
{{55049764-0-16310:}}I overheard Keshargo talking to you. You brought the knot out of the citadel. That's the best news I've gotten all day. \n\nI was supposed to be the one to run the knot out of there. Thanks for doing what I couldn't.
{{55049764-0-16311:}}Xoryn's dead? Good. That saves me a lot of work learning how to fight so I can get revenge.
{{55049764-0-16316:}}Well done, comrade. I don't know about you, but I'm done with broken mirrors and Daedric monsters and old ruins. A flagon of Colovian red to wash the dust of this place from my throat. That's what I need now.
{{55049764-0-16317:}}We should not linger here. The destruction of the Loom has created new instabilities along the Many Paths. Until they subside, the area around the Loom is dangerous. I do not wish to be lost again in the Many Paths.\n\nUse the portal I opened, proxy.
{{55049764-0-16315:}}Did we win? I think we won. But what happened to Ithelia. She … changed again, didn't she?\n\nAs fascinating as all this is, I'm ready to see trees and grass and skies of blue again. Let's go home.
{{55049764-0-16318:}}Only those authorized by the Guild have access to this portal.\n\nVotary Nahlia said you're good to come and go as you please.
{{55049764-0-16319:}}And all this time … book that would … location … meditate on.\n\n… I just need a little more time.
{{55049764-6-15797:}}Careful now, a cunning and foul beast has made off with an important document and played Mizzik for a fool. Perhaps you can help retrieve it?
{{55049764-15-15971:}}The Ayleids made a habit of keeping their most-valuable treasures safely underground. We're looking for a way down—the stairs in the middle of the ruins, or maybe a cave.
{{55049764-8-16130:}}This place is incredible. We'll have to explore when we're not in mortal danger. \n\nAll this unstable magic seems to be flowing from those doors to the altar.
{{55049764-6-15793:}}Valente's alchemical equipment is truly impressive. It's a shame we have to destroy it, but we need to make sure no one else can continue his experiments.
{{55049764-17-15960:}}That's Balandrus's handwriting all right. Looks like he made a deal with Grivier to sacrifice the rest of the townsfolk to the Terror of the Weald.\n\nIf Grivier's still alive, I can make him talk.
{{55049764-37-15960:}}I know what you are, night hunter! If the Terror of the Weald or whatever Balandrus calls himself these days sent you, know that I'm still the warrior I ever was.\n\nI'm heading into Sutch, and I'll go through you if I have to.
{{55049764-10-16170:}}Ulfsild's annotations have been revealed. \n\nRead the fable once more to learn its hidden meaning.
{{55049764-5-16162:}}Bella said she wanted to see the knife you just found. Go talk to her. \n\nI think I know what's going on here, but if she says what I think she will, then I have the final piece of the puzzle.
{{55049764-5-16163:}}Hurry! Put the crystal on the altar!
{{55049764-6-16208:}}Prison was harder on Naku than the rest of us. Something about being in chains or cages when he was younger. When we were released, he couldn't get away fast enough. He had to know he was free and clear, for certain.
{{55049764-6-16202:}}The path to master Scribing seems to be a winding one, eh? Fable upon fable.\n \nExcept, I know I've heard the story of Mizbi before and when I paged through earlier it seemed … off.
{{55049764-6-16206:}}I'll look after Big Urm. Go with Hooke and get Val back!
{{55049764-6-16207:}}Do you need something, traveler? I'm waiting on a friend of mine to bring me something very important.
{{55049764-6-16204:}}Caelum hasn't killed her yet, thank the Eight. But I have a feeling he's just waiting for an audience. Well, I'm not going to lose any more Scarlets.\n\nI know how to get her away from him.
{{55049764-32-15960:}}Let me see that. Definitely Tham's letters, though obviously written in a hurry. He says one thing but means another. Very clever!\n\nHe's not talking about wine, that's for certain. And I know exactly where he wants me to look when we're done here.
{{55049764-4-16210:}}The mysteries and oddities of Oblivion will never cease to amaze. \n\nAre you all right? Keshargo does not know of anyone else who has been exposed to the knot and survived.
{{55049764-3-15981:}}Time isn't on our side, friend. The Skein of Secrets indicates that King Nantharion—and likely Ithelia, too—are already in Vashabar. If we don't stop them now, we might not get another chance.
{{55049764-3-15985:}}I'm getting entirely too comfortable with stepping through magical portals. It's just not natural.\n\nWell, no point in stopping now. Let's press on.
{{55049764-3-15984:}}Don't worry about me. I picked up some healing skills over the years. I'll do what I can for the wounded legionaries, then find a way to catch up with you.\n\nAnd Abolisher will work. Remember how you used it at Niryastare!
{{55049764-3-15987:}}The legionary found you? Good.\n\nI was reviewing recent reports from the tribune's scouts just before you came in. The Recollection's on the run, but the Mirrormoor incursions continue unabated. Shardmarshal Vargas isn't done with us yet.
{{55049764-3-16184:}}Did you pass the trial? That look on your face. The riddle did the trick! Congratulations! \n\nYou can never be certain things will turn out in your favor where dragons are concerned. Even if she's not a traditional Dragon.
{{55049764-0-16297:}}You're the one I saw in Fyrelight Cave. Why do you involve yourself with scum like the Scarlets? Surely you must know what they did. What they took from me!
{{55049764-0-16294:}}I wish I could muster the courage to go back in, fight the raging fires and monstrous beasts myself.
{{55049764-0-16293:}}You've done us a great service, stranger. If you don't mind my saying, I feel that we're cut from the same cloth. Putting others before ourselves. A wonderful, if tiring, quality. Take care.
{{55049764-0-16292:}}We owe you a great debt. Should we meet again in safer times, I'll treat you to a frosty one.
{{55049764-0-16291:}}Seems I underestimated your aid, traveler. Thank you for saving the lives you could.
{{55049764-0-16290:}}I'm certain history won't carry on my name. I never sought recognition. I created Scribing to understand magic better. To understand myself better. \n\nBut, of course, my journey did not end when I left the Scholarium.
{{55049764-0-16299:}}Are … are you here for my grandmother? You should speak to her before Father throws a fit and makes us move again. He doesn't like it when people come looking for her.
{{55049764-0-16121:}}We were just talking about you friend! I'm glad you could make time to visit. And I'm glad I was here to see you! Leramil's been showing me around Apocrypha, but I need to return to my duties at the Necropolis soon.\n\nWell, soon-ish.
{{55049764-0-16123:}}Despite rumors to the contrary, Carvain Ranch only hires qualified applicants. Seasoned ranch hands only. We have no time or inclination to train novices. And we especially have no need of … rowdies.\n\nPerhaps you should inquire at the quarry, hmm?
{{55049764-0-16122:}}Another worker out sick, and right after one of my best died in his sleep. You look strong. Interested in making some coin in the quarry, stranger?
{{55049764-0-16125:}}It seems my reflection is gaining in power. How shameful to watch at the moment of my failure.\n\nLeave me, pathwalker. Let me fall the way I want to.
{{55049764-0-16127:}}A Daedra, here? Did it say doom? Didn't you just avert one of those?\n\nWell, it clearly is trying to get your attention, waving around its many eye stalks and tentacles. Go see what it wants.
{{55049764-0-16129:}}Amazing how far we've come since that day I first flagged you down.\n\nI'd like to think I played an integral part to all of this! Being loud enough to catch your attention certainly has its benefits.
{{55049764-0-16128:}}That's a Daedra? Are we under attack? No, no, it definitely spoke to you. It brings a warning, I think.\n\nPlease, go find out what doom I need to worry about next, hero.
{{55049764-22-16043:}}The door is recessed between a gap in some rocks. I wouldn't call it a hidden entrance, but it's easy to miss if you don't know about it. I'll point it out.\n\nOnce inside, we'll find Commander Merian. He'll tell us how we can help.
{{55049764-3-16340:}}Ostumir was never a metropolis, but it was our home.
{{55049764-3-16341:}}Family comes first. That's what I always said. We built a nice home here. But now everything is ruined.
{{55049764-10-16043:}}I wondered when Shardmarshal Vargas would turn up again. I still owe her for Rustwall.\n\nAnd she has a new sword. Did you see how it opened a portal? Brought in reinforcements from someplace she called Mirrormoor. We need to take that blade.
{{55049764-6-15969:}}We know the Staff of Many Paths was used in a ritual to prepare the wildburn seeds. If Nantharion's using the staff in all those places, we could be looking at a massive wildburn event—something big enough to destroy Skingrad and all of West Weald.
{{55049764-9-15960:}}If Balandrus is turning the townsfolk into bloodfiends to create a vampire army, then he must be keeping them in dens until he's ready to set them loose. Let's use the remaining alchemical components to destroy those dens.\n\nListen for their wails.
{{55049764-15-15785:}}No matter how many times I assist you or Leramil, I don't think I'll ever get used to all the Daedra.
{{55049764-15-15786:}}Leramil and that floating ball of eyes told me to meet you here. They explained all about the reality tears. They sound terrible! What's going to befall us next, I wonder.
{{55049764-15-15782:}}Gaius said he hid the key to the catacombs inside a statue. No doubt the garden has a lot of those. This is a Colovian estate, after all.\n\nHopefully the map he drew for us is accurate.
{{55049764-31-15778:}}Even if the relics no longer contain any power, they should be preserved. Honored for their part in preserving our world. Put them away for now. Perhaps we can figure out a more permanent solution later.
{{55049764-7-16282:}}You perch atop a mountain of accomplishments, an interloper no longer.\n\nYou've unlocked the wings of the Netch, the Dragon, the Gryphon, and the Indrik. Now only a final door remains.
{{55049764-7-16286:}}Let me re-read that quick. Right, spreads from brazier to brazier. Lighting one can ignite or extinguish others in the circle. \n\nI guess that could mean a lot of trial and error.
{{55049764-4-16057:}}Mmm. Must be Ciiril's new batch. No matter! A union between Laeni and that son of a Dawnway does not have my support. Not at all!\n\nI'll make sure Laeni knows that—as soon as I'm done with this jagga.
{{55049764-3-16062:}}I see our conversation has borne fruit. Well done.
{{55049764-3-16061:}}The pollen bats of my heart are swarming with joy. To think Laeni and Clendagal might be able to stay!
{{55049764-3-16060:}}I'm on the edge of my blade here. If they can pull this off, we're having so many drinks tonight!
{{55049764-9-15985:}}Plenty of Recollection and Shardborn, but no sign of Nantharion or Vargas yet. I say we press on.
{{55049764-17-15778:}}With the three relics that were once used to imprison Ithelia restored, we must determine where to even begin our search for the Forgotten Prince.\n\nBefore we discuss the idea that Scruut and I derived, do you have anything else to report?
{{55049764-17-15779:}}Before we depart, gather the Daedric relics—Abolisher, the Lamp of Clarity, and the Skein of Secrets. Even though they're depleted, the Great Eye has seen that you will need them in the trials to come.\n\nAnd I'm certainly not going to carry them.
{{55049764-9-16182:}}I know that look. You've been tasked with busywork, haven't you?\n\nWell, it seems we're in the same boat. At least I'm fortunate to have it confined to the library, not wherever some mystical being decides to send me on a whim.
{{55049764-9-16183:}}It seems like the Netch has stopped its pranks. Thank Magnus, and thank you. \n\nI suppose even children get tired of the same gag over and over.
{{55049764-1-16387:}}<The scamp points to small hand-written sign nearby. Caal: Assistant Chronicler, Familiar to Firandil, Merchant.>
{{55049764-5-16202:}}The others and I are trying to look at the Fable of the Dragon the way you do. You know, deciphering locations from the text. In case you need our help.\n\nIt's started a few arguments, but I don't mind. Helps that I like the work!
{{55049764-5-16205:}}The Divines finally put an end to this. I think they had some help from you, friend.\n\nEver since Caelum Vineyard years ago, my faith came from a place of fear. But you've given me a lot to think about. Thank you.
{{55049764-5-16204:}}Sorry to put you through that, but Caelum never would have paused to listen to me. And I wouldn't have blamed him. I hoped we could make amends somehow. I guess it wasn't meant to work out that way.\n\nBut at least Val's alive, thanks to you.
{{55049764-5-16207:}}Looks like you have your hands full there, traveler. What's that squawking?
{{55049764-5-16206:}}Thank you. Thank you for cleaning up after the drunken mess I made of things and saving Val. It's just … after that night, the fire, and now coming back here, it was all too much.\n\nI should have done better.
{{55049764-5-16208:}}You're back. But where's Naku?\n\nI think you'd better talk to Hooke, friend. Quickly.
{{55049764-8-15786:}}I'm ready to set out for these ruins whenever you are, friend.
{{55049764-14-16266:}}Sorry again about ripping up the fable. Hopefully my slobber didn't mess up the magic.\n\nI wouldn't know what to do if it did. Maybe … more slobber? No no no, that can't be right.
{{55049764-0-15865:}}We meet again. Do you know this place, this shrine? Were you drawn to it, just as I was?
{{55049764-0-15864:}}I did not expect to meet the Prince of Paths this soon, proxy. Nor did I expect her to look more or less mortal. I … do not know what I expected.\n\nThere is nothing left to learn in Elenglynn. Let us speak outside, under the open sky.
{{55049764-0-15866:}}Thank you again for saving us down in the winery.\n\nI thought if I ever got out of that cage, I'd leave and never come back. But Lady Valente offered quite the sum to stay. Maybe things really will be different under new management.
{{55049764-0-15868:}}There is nothing more to do in this place, mortal. Use the portal and return to your own realm.
{{55049764-10-16021:}}The Lamp led us to the same location as the first path, but in a much different reality. I see my loyal soldiers line the halls, but despair fills the air.\n\nWe are not welcome here. Tread carefully as you search for the ingredient we need.
{{55049764-1-16166:}}That damned Nantharion got what he deserved! Good riddance to dead birch wood, I say!
{{55049764-8-16276:}}Nothing's tried to kill us, yet. Let's just be ready for anything, some of my most memorable patrols started all nice and calm.\n\nBefore the screaming and running.
{{55049764-1-16149:}}Feldagard Keep still stands, thanks to you. I'd like to find a way to remove the taint those Recollection dogs left in the barracks. Daedric magic is foul, and the stink of Mirrormoor is fouler still.
{{55049764-1-16145:}}Watch your step on the other side of that door, there's raw magic aplenty. I also have a personal code about seeing our adventurer-consultants being torn apart.
{{55049764-2-16144:}}I found your conversation with my Prince very interesting. A mortal walking the Many Paths? And in service of the Fatechanger? I must respect that.\n\nI hope you find what you need to help your Ithelia. Maybe you'll succeed where I have failed.
{{55049764-2-16147:}}I need to figure out what to do next. Do I learn to live with this curse or find a way to cure it, like Maer did? And what about the town? Do we abandon Sutch or try to rebuild?\n\nToo many questions and not enough answers. At least Maerenah's back.
{{55049764-14-15798:}}Oh, are you helping the investigator? We could certainly use the help finding Betu! He's usually better behaved when we have guests around. I think I heard some barking along the outer wall.
{{55049764-5-16269:}}Move quickly and with courage as you steal these magics, mortal. The Fox is a stalwart ally, but where you are going the shadows run deep.
{{55049764-0-16219:}}For years, I've devoted myself to the keeping of sacred texts. To think those texts would live on through the actions of our children. Hmm.
{{55049764-0-16218:}}I thought I could lead them. Save them. But by the time the fighting was done, I was the only one left standing. \n\nI'll never forget this feeling.
{{55049764-0-16217:}}No matter how many times you lose a squadron, it never gets any easier. \n\nNo need to stick around, mercenary. I'll be ready to head out myself in another few moments.
{{55049764-0-16214:}}I'd go with you to find my father, but he specifically told me to stay with my mother. Protect her, you understand? Good luck out there.
{{55049764-0-16212:}}You're alive? That's fantastic! It must be over now. I hope Keshargo's not too upset with me for leaving. I abandoned him in the middle of an attack. Even if I beg for forgiveness …. \n\nNo, I was a coward before, I won't be one again.
{{55049764-0-16211:}}The null arca worked beautifully. Now that this experiment is over, I can market it all over Fargrave. Any pesky artifacts or relics with unwanted effects will no longer be an issue—for an exorbitant price, of course.
{{55049764-0-16210:}}It is done, thank Hermorah. This one is relieved to know that the null arca works. All that's left to do is break camp and travel back to the city.\n\nKeshargo is going to miss this sky.
{{55049764-6-15856:}}Between the Recollection and the dangers inherent in most ruins, I suggest caution. My research revealed that Elenglynn contains a maze filled with deadly traps. We must reach the heart of the maze to find a way through.\n\nI am ready when you are.
{{55049764-6-15857:}}Do you think the Legion can hear the bells?
{{55049764-6-15852:}}Please, don't worry about me. Save the dog. It's what my aunt would have wanted.
{{55049764-6-15850:}}Apologies. Recent events have been overwhelming to say the least. I needed some fresh air and my dear Uriel saw fit to join me. Is there anything I can help you with?
{{55049764-6-15851:}}I'm Uriel, son of our dearly departed. I appreciate you and the Khajiit's help in fulfilling my mother's final wishes. If only Aquilia and Pelena were as focused. So much talk of conspiracy …. I'm certain it's the grief talking.
{{55049764-11-16021:}}So much of the path we just walked was familiar to me. The shrine, my scions. I remember it now. When Hermaeus Mora and the others arrived. Took my power. Locked me away.\n\nI had a plan as well, but I do not remember just surrendering like that.
{{55049764-1-16269:}}Take the sigil, mortal. The Fox has been known to claim shimmering objects left out in the open. Best not to tempt him.
{{55049764-1-16268:}}Don't be long, I'm thirsty!
{{55049764-1-16266:}}You did so good! Congratulations! Any time you're up for stealing more stuff from Daedric Princes, just let me know. \n\nJust don't tell the Gryphon all right?
{{55049764-1-16265:}}You know, I always wanted to be buried with a crown of flowers.
{{55049764-1-16264:}}I understood my other facets. None of them were perfect, but I recognized them as part of myself. \n\nThis one is different though. I've been suppressing her for a long time. I don't want to take her back.
{{55049764-3-15789:}}You there! The Imperial Legion of West Weald has need of your services. There are problems throughout the region and not enough legionaries to deal with them.\n\nWould you be available to hire?
{{55049764-3-15788:}}Greetings, citizen. Are you here about the job postings? No? Well then, carry on.
{{55049764-3-15786:}}Despite all that happened, I'm curious to see how this ritual plays out.
{{55049764-3-15782:}}My cohort, almost completely destroyed. The Rustwall staff, almost all dead. Even Shardmarshal Vargas managed to escape us again. While we closed the portal and saved Skingrad, it feels like we failed, comrade.
{{55049764-3-15781:}}Necromancers passed this by, huh? Even with all of them working together, they probably can't figure out how to release the shards.\n\nThat won't be a problem for us. Not with that Aetherial alarum I gave you. You still have it, right?
{{55049764-3-15780:}}Keep a close eye on Orissa. She is a brave lady but very headstrong.
{{55049764-1-15987:}}I wasn't sure what I expected the Skein to show us, but I assumed it would be … not that?\n\nI think that marks a spot near the old ruin of Wendir. Maybe Leramil can shed some more light on what this means.
{{55049764-1-15985:}}There's Beragon! Come on, comrade—we can't let him confront Ithelia and her servants all by himself. We need to hurry!
{{55049764-1-15984:}}I'll be all right. Go stop King Nantharion!
{{55049764-1-15983:}}That report we found about Feldagard Keep concerns me. If the Shardborn capture the fortress, they'll control the Colovian Hills. I have to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\nFind me there if you have time, comrade. I'm sure I will need your help.
{{55049764-1-15982:}}Greetings, stranger. All are welcome in Vashabar. But tell me, who enters my humble abode with Beragon, the hero of Ninglenirre Pass? And what was that about a danger to our unassuming town?
{{55049764-1-15981:}}Go on, I'll be right behind you. \n\nYou know, I'm kind of eager to see a legendary Ayleid stronghold no one else has set foot inside in centuries. If not for all the enemies who might be waiting inside to slaughter us, this might be sort of exciting.
{{55049764-1-15980:}}A Colovian soldier can't just stroll into our town and throw around accusations! If not for Beragon …. He may not be part of our settlement, but his good works are known to us.\n\nWell, what is it? What did you bring to show me?
{{55049764-1-15989:}}Please! You can't leave me like this! Not like a boar trussed up for slaughter! I need to get back to my family!
{{55049764-1-15988:}}My alchemist shop is close by. Feel free to make use of anything in there. I don't know of any potions that harm vampires, but much of my stock is explosive … when mixed correctly.\n\nAnd if you find Grivier, please send him back to us.
{{55049764-0-16009:}}If I'm not mistaken, that portal is exactly what we need. Let's get out of here while we can!
{{55049764-0-16007:}}I don't want to bother you. I'm looking to get away from the war in Cyrodiil, but don't know where to go.
{{55049764-29-15971:}}I'm beginning to think I don't understand the Recollection at all. Everything we learn about them only raises new questions.
{{55049764-0-16005:}}Sure, my lifelong friend joined a violent cult, but you and I actually did some real good today. We saved people in Ostumir and kept this seed away from the Recollection.\n\nWhen you're ready, meet Leramil and me at my townhouse in Skingrad.
{{55049764-0-16002:}}I don't understand magic and I know next to nothing about Daedra, but I do know war. This is war, comrade. And there's no one I'd rather face it with than you, Beragon, and Leramil.\n\nFor whatever good it will do, my sword is yours.
{{55049764-0-16003:}}Thank you for all your help. I'll gather what supplies we have and help these people get to Skingrad.
{{55049764-3-16293:}}I can assure you, there is no matter more urgent than the injuries I am tending to.
{{55049764-6-16178:}}Well done, mortal. You have risen to the challenge. One task remains. \n\nIf I am to lend you my strength, you must lend me yours. Power for power. A wrong righted, and another step on the path.
{{55049764-6-16170:}}Peer through the lens, reveal the wards, and claim the key fragment. This may seem a small step, but an incredible path waits before you.
{{55049764-7-16208:}}I had hoped to move on from all this. To never look back. But it's been a long time since I've seen Hooke this driven. It reminds me of the good things I found among this group.\n\nNot everything about those days was evil.
{{55049764-16-16017:}}I am surprised you were not injured, proxy. Unrolling the Skein of Secrets appeared to precipitate a reciprocal paroxysm—that is, it triggered a backlash. As I am sure you noticed.
{{55049764-16-16014:}}I fear I'm very busy at the moment. Unless you have business with me, please feel free to carry on.
{{55049764-4-16282:}}Aut'arioth could meet no more fitting end.\n\nInheritor, you've come all this way on the wings of fables. Let me tell you one final story. In the last days of the Scholarium, Ulfsild's heart was filled with sorrow.
{{55049764-2-15788:}}Ah, are you here about the job postings? West Weald's Legion could use some capable hands.
{{55049764-2-15786:}}You really did it? You created a new Daedric relic? That's not something that happens every day.
{{55049764-2-15785:}}Uh, I always feel unclean after traveling through a portal from Oblivion. But enough of my problems, go talk to Scruut.
{{55049764-2-15782:}}A good officer gives credit where credit is due. You did good here, comrade. Rustwall won't be ready to host Count Calantius and his guests for a while, but we learned the fate of my cohort and stopped an invasion.\n\nNot bad for a day's work.
{{55049764-2-15780:}}Orissa would like to speak to you. She is over there with dear old Lazen.
{{55049764-2-15781:}}Yeah, I wasn't paying attention to the pattern either. \n\nJust activate the alarum again and watch the pattern. Then replicate the pattern to release the shard.
{{55049764-4-16130:}}All that magic … you just transformed it? How?\n\nDon't answer that. I know you're in the dark as much as I am. Go speak to the Crow.
{{55049764-9-15840:}}Gilraedal's Book of Obscure and Ancient Spirits. That's the book's name! Search around the courtyard behind the inn. Also, try the outbuilding in the far back. I found junk in there, too.\n\nBring me the book and we'll see if it has the recipe we need.
{{55049764-8-15840:}}She hasn't moved once since you left. I tried talking to her, but she only muttered quietly to herself. I'd almost feel bad for her if I wasn't losing sales.\n\nDid you find that book on obscure drinks?
{{55049764-20-15971:}}Niryastare lies in the western Colovian Hills. It's rather dilapidated. And haunted. I had a harrowing experience there back when I was actively adventuring.\n\nLeramil wants to speak with you. Talk to her, then meet me at Niryastare.
{{55049764-1-16075:}}Oh no, what happened to Calvo? And who's ringing the bell? But why are you talking to me? Go report to the captain!
{{55049764-8-16184:}}I promise if I remember anything about Mizbi's riddle, I'll tell you as soon as it comes to mind.
{{55049764-8-16183:}}The texts Ulfsild gathered about the Gryphon are interesting. He seems surly, very focused, single-minded.\n\nI like the sound of him.
{{55049764-8-16182:}}Everything I've heard about this Gryphon makes him seem like a knight, one who's taken a vow. Righting wrongs, upholding justice. \n\nKnights of the Lamp don't often go on errantry, but this Gryphon … hmm. Soup for speculation.
{{55049764-25-16043:}}Good, you came. After we finished at Hoperoot, I raced to Feldagard Keep to warn them about the report we found. But as you can hear, the battle already rages on. If only we found that Recollection report earlier.
{{55049764-11-16002:}}I believe that was the last relic you needed. You should meet back up with Leramil and Scruut at Beragon's townhouse.
{{55049764-13-16021:}}Ithelia … she is a reflection of me. She knew about Sage's Dream. I remember now. My followers praised me in this chamber while I drank from a goblet.\n\nGather the tirum weed that she offered so we can make the drink.
{{55049764-11-16162:}}It'll be hard to miss the Bitterfish's camp. It's just west of here. Look for the campfire. Or walk until you smell fish. Watching the Goblins and studying their mannerisms would be a lot easier if their camps didn't smell so strongly.
{{55049764-15-16043:}}Like an old-fashioned Colovian skeever hunt. Take out every last one of those Daedra, comrade!
{{55049764-13-16017:}}Ithelia's true prison was being forgotten. Once Torvesard remembered her, she escaped this doleful place easily enough. I am confident we can find our way out, too. Look around, proxy.
{{55049764-13-16014:}}Hush! Can't you see I'm busy blending into my surroundings?
{{55049764-17-15786:}}Leramil's waiting in my townhouse in Skingrad. I'm going to try to find Tribune Alea, then I'll meet you there.
{{55049764-14-16276:}}Did I hear the Crow say she's a Luminary? I thought she was Ulfsild's familiar. I suppose she could be both. \n\nWait, hold on. Congratulations! You're heading in to your final trial!
{{55049764-8-16010:}}The trail leads to that door, proxy. Let us see what lies upon the other side.
{{55049764-34-15793:}}You're not planning to attend the Valente Vineyards auction, are you? I'm sure something untoward is going on in there.\n\nHmm, you seem capable. Would you be willing to help me investigate the situation? House Ravenwatch can be very generous.
{{55049764-10-16264:}}I wish I didn't need my petty emotions. They only cause trouble.\n\nI'm still linked to my facets. I sense one near a river south of Skingrad. It's probably my despair. I can be rather dramatic when I'm in a doleful mood, and the water is comforting.
{{55049764-4-16257:}}Have you found Burnbiscuit yet?
{{55049764-4-16255:}}You're back! I assume that means good things? Or that the Daedric Princes are very angry with you.
{{55049764-2-16350:}}The Legion never backs down from a fight.
{{55049764-2-16351:}}Why are Daedra attacking us? What did we do to them?
{{55049764-2-16352:}}If I see a Daedra, I'll run it through!
{{55049764-2-16353:}}When the Daedra first breached the wall, I thought we were done for.
{{55049764-2-15768:}}You're back! And with my dowry in tow! This is still plenty to impress the Verdulis's eldest daughter and secure her hand. I could kiss you, adventurer! Though, I suppose I should save that for my bride-to-be.
{{55049764-3-15864:}}It seems my sources were not mistaken about the maze in Elenglynn … or the deadly traps. We must find our way to the chamber at the heart of the maze and see where it leads us next.
{{55049764-5-16257:}}A promotion? Is that what the count said? Thanks so much for helping me find Burnbiscuit, friend. I'm not sure I could have done it without you.
{{55049764-5-16255:}}I know you can handle yourself out there. Just make sure that Fox doesn't get caught, all right?\n\nAs far as I can tell, the Princes don't know about the Scholarium. Let's keep it that way.
{{55049764-15-15960:}}Damn it, I thought I could do this, but you should talk to Grivier. Find out what he knows. \n\nJust the sight of him makes me what to run him through. If I try to make him talk, he won't last long enough to tell us anything.
{{55049764-2-16017:}}Shardmarshal Vargas hopes to delay us long enough for Ithelia to finish her work with the Loom. We must defeat Vargas as quickly as we can!
{{55049764-2-16015:}}My dear Narsis is always overflowing with tales of his discoveries, I find myself impatient waiting to hear about them.
{{55049764-2-16014:}}This place is in a disarray. Do you think you … I mean we, could excavate one of these tiles? No, no, Narsis Dren does not loot. Let me instead commit them to my notes here.
{{55049764-2-16013:}}Beragon's an old friend. He'll appreciate my discovery. I hope you do, as well.\n\nThe ruins are to the southeast of the village. Meet me outside the entrance when you finish helping survivors. I can't wait for Beragon to see what I found.
{{55049764-2-16011:}}I've fought in enough battles to appreciate the chance to savor a victory, even when I know there's going to be another fight tomorrow. Enjoy this while you can, comrade. There's unfinished business ahead of us.
{{55049764-2-16010:}}I believe the mirrors are a lock or activation method of some kind. They might awaken the dormant portal, if we can but determine the correct order in which to activate them.\n\nTouch them, and we will see if anything changes.
{{55049764-2-16019:}}What is that thing? Never mind, it wants to talk to you. Go find out what it means by we're all doomed.
{{55049764-7-16129:}}Do you think any of these Luminaries want to meet me? I'll have to pop my head in those doors and introduce myself soon.
{{55049764-4-15785:}}I can't say I followed all that, but after everything that happened in Necrom, I know a threat to Hermaeus Mora can spill into the mortal plane. And Ithelia looked very angry!\n\nTalk to Leramil. She must have a plan.
{{55049764-4-15786:}}Poor Leramil. I wish there was something I could do to comfort her. It's never easy to lose an ally, especially one you care about.\n\nYou should talk to Scruut about the fragment, though, friend.
{{55049764-4-15780:}}This one was not hurt too badly, but Mahkkin is in no haste to return to those caves. This one is no warrior. Mahkkin smushes grapes.
{{55049764-4-15781:}}The alarum works! No surprises there. I'll go wait outside while you take the Alarum and find more shards. Don't want to get in your way.\n\nI might stand a chance facing down minotaurs if I was a necromancer, but I'm just a regular mage. Oh well.
{{55049764-4-15782:}}My cohort, almost completely destroyed. The Rustwall staff, almost all dead. Even Shardmarshal Vargas managed to slip from our grasp. While we closed the portal and saved Skingrad, it feels like we failed, comrade.
{{55049764-5-16010:}}I am sorry, proxy. I tried to shield our companions, but I could not. It took all the strength I could muster to prevent us from being banished along with them.\n\nIt seems Shardmarshal Vargas is much more powerful than when last we faced her.
{{55049764-5-16011:}}Our esteemed guests want to speak with you, but you should check in with Beragon first. He wants to compare notes before we start handing out the laurels of victory.
{{55049764-1-16035:}}I can't believe I allowed myself to get captured by this bunch. If my fellow legionaries hear about this ….\n\nBut tell me, did you stop the mercenaries from polluting the reservoir with the remaining elixir?
{{55049764-5-16014:}}Here we are. Pour what we've found into that altar's basin. It is an altar - we should feed it sacred water. Anything else would be disrespectful to the sanctity of this piece of Ayleid history.
{{55049764-5-16015:}}It's you! Good fortune for all of us. Narsis Dren will be most pleased if you're the one to help him.
{{55049764-5-16017:}}As this prison was once part of Mirrormoor, it is fundamentally connected to the Loom. As the Loom's power reaches its zenith, it absorbs the energy of other relics—as it did with the Skein and the Lamp. I fear for Abolisher, but you must try.
{{55049764-5-16019:}}Through all we faced, it wasn't until I was lost in the Many Paths that I realized the true danger to the Weald. I think you saved everything when you destroyed the Loom of the Untraveled Road.\n\nOf course, Ithelia is still out there somewhere.
{{55049764-1-16039:}}Be careful, deputy. If Constable Yabren's right, whoever's behind all this didn't hesitate to remove the healer and Yabren's father when they got too close to the truth.\n\nWatch yourself at Carvain Manor and Raxalee Tower.
{{55049764-4-16202:}}You listened to the echo? I think she's talking about the portal room, but we searched it three times over.\n\nThere's no fable in there.
{{55049764-4-16204:}}I can't thank you enough. If only I'd been a hair quicker—but Val's alive. That's all that matters now.\n\nBack in the cellar, with Caelum and the fire. It might sound crazy, but I feel like that should have been me.
{{55049764-4-16205:}}By the Eight, it's nothing less than a miracle! Valenia just survived the fatal blade, thanks to you and Hooke. But I see divine providence at work as well.
{{55049764-4-16207:}}What do you have there, traveler? Something is wrestling about in your bag like a fellrunner on fire.
{{55049764-13-16266:}}Poor guy, look at how tense he is. \n\nDon't worry, he's a really good person when he's not mad about being frozen solid for centuries.
{{55049764-13-16269:}}You face the Dragon's riddles. I cannot help you, but rest assured her eccentricities are outweighed by her wisdom.\n\nMost of the time.
{{55049764-4-15847:}}You're no legionary. But I don't think you're one of those bandits, either. And you're certainly not one of my raw recruits.\n\nSo, care to take on a commission from the captain of Fort Colovia?
{{55049764-4-15849:}}If it's work you're looking for, you've no business with me, stranger. The over-anxious red-head is the one you want to talk to.
{{55049764-4-15848:}}I feel so guilty for not being here. Poor Lady Weatherleah.
{{55049764-9-16130:}}I have no idea where we are. Stay close, traveler.
{{55049764-0-16329:}}Time to get back to work. Can't blame my lack of progress on feeling scared any more.\n\nThanks for clearing that up. I guess.
{{55049764-0-16328:}}Well, all the weird stuff is gone. I guess this means customers will come back. So it'll get noisy again.\n\nI suppose I could put wax in my ears. I certainly don't want to find someplace else to work.
{{55049764-0-16323:}}Congratulations. You've accomplished incredible things. Through you, my work finally lives on. Gather any allies you choose.\n\nWe will see if the Crow deems you worthy. If you are the inheritor of the Scholarium. See you on the other side.
{{55049764-0-16321:}}Can't tell you how many times I've wanted to give Ruri a good telling off. Never did like the fellow.
{{55049764-0-16327:}}Oh, thank you so much. My hands cramped from all the strumming. Now the weird things are gone and I can take a break.\n\nMaybe I can charge Brynmir for all that music.
{{55049764-0-16326:}}The strange people are gone. I suspect the sky outside is back to normal now, too. That lady by the fire vanished into thin air, so that's good. Everything is the way it should be again.\n\nBut you're still talking to me.
{{55049764-0-16325:}}Aw, the people are gone. I just had a good conversation with one. She didn't say much, but that's fine.\n\nBring them back!
{{55049764-0-16324:}}This door leads to West Weald in southwestern Cyrodiil.\n\nAn area of wealth and prosperity, West Weald faces increasing tension. Between a fringe Wood Elf cult and the native Colovians, a cataclysmic confrontation approaches. Will you investigate?
{{55049764-24-15971:}}Tribune Alea and Leramil can use your help. The tribune is worried about an attack at Feldagard Keep. And Leramil thinks it's important to investigate the Outcast Inn.\n\nSee what you can do to help them, then come back here.
{{55049764-6-16035:}}We can rendezvous at the Stonechip Gambling Den after you speak with Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee. They have offices here in town.\n\nMeanwhile, I want to look into Healer Nevama's death. Find out exactly what happened.
{{55049764-30-15960:}}I gave that sword to Tham after he had a bit of trouble with some very drunk caravan guards. He kept it on a hook behind the bar. Never once saw him draw it while I was around.\n\nObviously, it got some use recently.
{{55049764-24-15800:}}Nothing more can be done for our imposter. Tend to Betu, Mizzik refuses to lose another life under this one's watch.
{{55049764-13-16130:}}Now that we have a moment, allow me to introduce myself. Nahlia, Votary knight in the Order of the Lamp. Pleasure to make your acquaintance, you're just as Vanus described you.\n\nIrnard briefed you on our situation?
{{55049764-5-16192:}}Ooh, you look like just the sort of heroic warrior I could use. My family's farm is facing some Goblin problems right now and I'm worried my uncle is going to do something terrible. Does that sound like something you could help with?
{{55049764-8-16266:}}You and I are heading to Rootwater Grove in Greenshade, Dawnbreak in Auridon, and an old fort called Faldar's Tooth in the Rift. Oh, and … make sure you bring some lockpicks.\n\nAnother adventure. With you! This is going to be so much fun!
{{55049764-19-15800:}}There she is, Pelena Weatherleah. Our killer. Quickly, while we have her cornered.
{{55049764-6-15781:}}Figures the one day I finally make it to these ruins they're overrun with danger. \n\nThis is what I get for procrastinating on collecting those Aetherial shards. Bad enough to handle Goblins and minotaurs without tossing necromancers into the mix!
{{55049764-6-15785:}}Scruut told me what happened here. Imagine, an apparatus that could change fate and alter history! How could even a Daedric Prince control such power?
{{55049764-3-16171:}}We came to West Weald for a new beginning, but there hasn't been much call for my talents. I'm a painter by trade, but the only work I can find here is at the Carvain Ranch.
{{55049764-3-16170:}}Just remember, you can always reference the Fable of the Indrik from your bag. Ulfsild's annotations will guide you on your journey. \n\nFind the wards, obtain the fragments. And soon you shall meet your first Luminary of Magic.
{{55049764-3-16172:}}We came here to start over, but Azemad labors on the ranch while I am forced to work in the quarry. They work us so hard, it is no wonder people are getting sick.
{{55049764-3-16178:}}My power is yours to wield, mortal. Merely take the sigil and bring it to the altar. It will remember what to do.
{{55049764-8-15960:}}Place the combustion canister in front of the door and I'll take care of the rest. \n\nI do suggest you take a few steps back before the boom, though.
{{55049764-10-16005:}}The Recollection consists mostly of Wood Elves, fanatics to a cause I haven't quite pinned down yet. If there are more of them in there, we'll probably need to fight.\n\nCome on. Let's head into the ruins and find Greenspeaker Sorilen.
{{55049764-16-15800:}}A bittersweet ending. This one appreciates that Otho and Betu will be looked after, Mizzik only wishes there had been less bloodshed along the way. To think all this began with Uriel's death all those years ago.
{{55049764-16-15802:}}We must be close, proxy. Keep moving.
{{55049764-4-16308:}}Chronicler Firandil at your service. Chronicler of tomes, scrolls, scripts, and otherworldly delights! \n\nI'm glad that I was able to make the trip. I think you'll find my skills quite valuable on this most unexpected expedition.
{{55049764-10-15991:}}Now that she mentioned it, I've heard of greenspring seeds. If the Recollection was able to corrupt the sacred seeds of the Green with Daedric magic … that's unthinkable!\n\nBefore we go look for that cart, we should talk to King Nantharion first.
{{55049764-10-15993:}}Stay back! Oh, apologies. I found this necromancer dying of vicious wounds. Arkay has her now, but you should be careful, traveler. There are dark things afoot here.
{{55049764-11-15782:}}That Dremora giving orders, they called her Shardmarshal Vargas. And those Wood Elves, they're part of that Recollection cult that's been spotted in the area.\n\nWe need more information, comrade. Let's press on.
{{55049764-11-15785:}}Scruut said to hold the map close to those bolts of silk. That should restore—what did she call it?—the Skein of Secrets?
{{55049764-11-15786:}}Be careful, friend. Daedra have a way of twisting words and disguising meanings. Hear what he has to say, but remain wary.
{{55049764-23-16266:}}You're doing fine. Trust me!
{{55049764-12-15981:}}Take a look at the Skein, friend. It's right over there.
{{55049764-12-15983:}}It's clear the Recollection has turned Hoperoot into a major stronghold. Take the map and the notes—they might tell us something about the Recollection's plans.
{{55049764-7-15960:}}Well, those bloodfiends won't be joining the Terror's army any time soon. Let's see if we can find another den.
{{55049764-25-15800:}}Quickly, we must look for clues. Whoever did this couldn't have gotten far and any lead will help us track them down.
{{55049764-1-15796:}}If you're here to complain about that pamphlet I posted about the jungle growth blazing through the countryside, I'm not overreacting. You just aren't seeing the danger it poses to everyone working outside of Skingrad.
{{55049764-1-15797:}}It seems the cook knows more than he is willing to let on. How very curious. Mizzik will have to make note of this. At least this confirms that the residents of the estate are keeping their secrets close to their chests.
{{55049764-1-15795:}}The wounds are painful, but this one thinks they are mostly superficial. Dro'vir will be all right. You should head inside and join the party.
{{55049764-1-15792:}}Well? Finish your report, mercenary. The signal fires in Varen's Watch. Are all four of them ignited?
{{55049764-1-15793:}}We wrecked Lord Gallio Valente's operation and his coven is broken. I'll stick around to help Ursilia destroy the tainted vines and any remaining samples of Vesper Valente. Then it's on to my next adventure, I suppose.\n\nJust like you, my friend.
{{55049764-1-15798:}}I can't believe Betu was so brave. Chasing down Pelena like that. I've never seen him so singularly focused.
{{55049764-1-15799:}}Next, we have to figure out what our precious Lady Sowerra is doing.
{{55049764-2-16255:}}Look at these constructs! The Archmagister himself will be jealous, if we can ever get him down here. Hah!
{{55049764-2-16254:}}Your dedication to restoring the Scholarium fills me with pride. \n\nThe Gryphon is a … complicated figure. I hope he treats you well.
{{55049764-2-16257:}}What have you found?
{{55049764-2-16256:}}You performed a great service for West Weald today, traveler! Without Sir Svendalmor of the Burnt-Biscuits at my side, Skingrad would fall apart!
{{55049764-2-16251:}}My final venture as a man of the sword.\n\nI resigned my station and took to mercenary work. I had tracked a bounty to these ruins, filled with traps and monsters. I was lost. Injured. I fell and my torch went out. I was alone. So alone.
{{55049764-2-16250:}}Do what you must. I'll watch over my husband and make sure he doesn't go running after you.
{{55049764-9-16054:}}Ciiril's my aunt. She owns the beer garden at the center of town. You can't miss her. \n\nY'ffre, the Singer himself, must have sent you. Thank you, traveler.
{{55049764-14-15973:}}I'll be glad when this is over and that Watchling finally stops entering my townhouse unannounced. All those eyes and squirming tentacles are … unnatural!
{{55049764-14-15972:}}Beragon calls that collection of parchment and bindings in his townhouse a library? He really ought to let me reorganize them from pointless to even more pointless.
{{55049764-9-15782:}}That's one of my legionaries. Listen to his report, comrade, while I keep an eye out for any of those Recollection bastards.
{{55049764-9-15786:}}An unknown ruin, filled with potential perils? I'm excited already.
{{55049764-13-15793:}}Go and find the items I mentioned. I'll prepare the equipment for your return.
{{55049764-13-15798:}}I'm Otho, the gardener. Betu must like you if he followed you back. He's a good judge of character, you know. Lady Weatherleah loved him dearly. I worry about what will become of him when all is said and done.
{{55049764-12-16276:}}The domain of the Crow, magic as far as the eye can see. Amazing. \n\nKind of reminds me of Ulfsild's study back in Sunnamere.
{{55049764-26-15971:}}The map we found at Hoperoot contains a valuable clue—I just know it. Give me some time and I'll decipher the code and figure it out.\n\nOne thing is already clear. King Nantharion and his allies aren't done with West Weald yet.
{{55049764-4-16042:}}I'm innocent, I tell you! I was just a pawn! It was all this damn lizard's idea!
{{55049764-4-16163:}}Place your hands on the altar. I will tell you what to do next.
{{55049764-1-16172:}}You are the deputy? The outsider who helped Constable Yabren bring justice to Ontus? Whatever she paid you, it wasn't enough for saving us from fatigue fever.
{{55049764-1-16171:}}You are Constable Yabren's deputy, yes? Thank you for revealing the truth behind fatigue fever. Perhaps now the town and its workers can both truly prosper.
{{55049764-1-16170:}}The Indrik's power has been unlocked. Splendid! Ulfsild would have been so very proud of you.\n\nYou should inform the Knight of your recent adventures. She's only just returned with a handful of assistants.
{{55049764-5-16118:}}Use Scruut's spell scroll to release the Lamp's energy and repair the tear.
{{55049764-1-16178:}}The power of my domain flows into the altar once more. My old friend would be at peace with what has come to pass.\n\nGo, continue to walk the path. Seek the other Luminaries and learn what you can from them as well.
{{55049764-2-16192:}}I recognize Pim, but who are you? Are you one of those hunters? No, I don't think so. Pim wouldn't stand within ten feet of you.\n\nIt doesn't matter. Can I see that knife now?
{{55049764-4-15985:}}I don't know how he did it, but Beragon managed to find us. Almost.\n\nOpen a portal so we can join our ally. We're going to need his help if we run into Shardmarshal Vargas and Nantharion at the same time. Or Ithelia, for that matter.
{{55049764-4-15966:}}After you, proxy. In addition to hearing what Hermaeus Mora has to say, I wish to ask him about what Ithelia showed me. If there is a way to restore Curate Gadayn, the One Who Knows should be able to tell me.
{{55049764-4-15960:}}No time to talk. Let's find Balandrus's lair and finish this.
{{55049764-4-15969:}}I was worried when Nantharion got away from us at Hoperoot. It felt like we were a step behind our enemies at every turn. But by recovering the relics, we finally seized the initiative.\n\nThat's our advantage.
{{55049764-3-16286:}}I'm still trying to get my stomach under control. Let's keep moving forward. With lots of nice, visible rock under our feet.
{{55049764-3-16282:}}I was Ulfsild, it's true. But after all these years, I much prefer my feathers.\n\nOnly two things remain. Who will tend to the Scholarium? And the location of the final sigil, the last bit of power needed to amplify the altar.
{{55049764-15-16014:}}You there! Can I interest you in participating in a valiant exploration of an Ayleid ruin? I find myself in need of a strong, able assistant. It's a chance you can't miss out on! I'll mention you prominently in my next book!
{{55049764-15-16017:}}I admit, I was not entirely certain that would work. Enter the portal, proxy. We can do nothing more here.
{{55049764-0-16172:}}Are the roads safe to travel again? We heard that the Recollection cult has been defeated. Even the Daedra that were rampaging through the wilderness are in retreat. Whoever is responsible for these miracles, we owe them a debt we can never repay.
{{55049764-0-16173:}}If you are seeing this, the Crow has set you on the path to learn the art of Scribing. A world of magic awaits you.
{{55049764-0-16170:}}I watched over this dormant library for centuries. Now it's filled with life and joy. I know she would be thrilled by this.\n\nPinfeathers. What do you do once you've outlived your destiny?
{{55049764-0-16171:}}The news out of Skingrad is frightening and inspiring in equal measure. The violent cultists and their Daedric allies attempted to conquer this land, but they were defeated. And now the count seeks peace with the Wood Elf town.\n\nInteresting times.
{{55049764-0-16178:}}This place resonates with the memory of Ulfsild, adventurer. Consider well the power, the trust, she has placed in you.
{{55049764-15-16184:}}Talk to Firandil, if you have a minute. He can be a bit of a big personality but he's the very best at what he does.
{{55049764-11-16010:}}The portal deposited us in the demiplane of Fargrave. It is a realm without a Prince that serves as a crossroad through Oblivion. A thousand doors lead in and out of Fargrave. Or so it is said.\n\nBut the fate of Beragon and the tribune concerns me.
{{55049764-11-16014:}}Let's be on our way now, assistant. The entrance to the catacombs of Wendir is nearby. Why are we dallying?
{{55049764-11-16017:}}We are fortunate this prison was not made to hold mortals, proxy. If we can navigate this maze of broken mirrors, I think we may find an escape route.
{{55049764-20-16266:}}You're so much quicker than I was expecting. I thought I'd have to come out and show you where it was.\n\nI'm one step closer to talking to the Gryphon again!
{{55049764-8-16020:}}This inn remains a point of convergence. Even before this day's events, this location thrummed with fate's energies.
{{55049764-8-16021:}}This reflection has given up. But she has no plan, no hope for the future as the last one we met. The Many Paths show the consequences of every action, every choice.\n\nGather some harkfruit and we will leave this wretched path.
{{55049764-7-16019:}}I know losing the use of the relics is bad, but at least we destroyed the Loom and stopped Ithelia from changing our reality. You know, I can't even conceive of what that actually means.\n\nBut now that we're back in West Weald, on to local matters.
{{55049764-7-16017:}}I wish I better understood the risks of using the Lamp of Clarity here, but we have no choice. We cannot leave the tribune trapped in her current predicament.
{{55049764-7-16014:}}Thanks to my dazzling intellect, I have deduced that we should anoint the altar with sacred water. Assistant! Apply the sacred water.
{{55049764-7-16010:}}It seems Beragon and Tribune Alea are safe. They just emerged from the portal in a different place than we did. Let us continue our search.
{{55049764-7-16011:}}That looks like a place you can use Abolisher and make us a path out of this accursed maze. Go ahead and open it!
{{55049764-7-15798:}}Betu seems to have run off again. It's embarrassing really. You'd think I'd be better at keeping a handle on him, but the dog is a free spirit. How are things? Made any progress since investigating the library?
{{55049764-16-16266:}}It should be easy enough to unmake the ward and free my friend. For you, at least! \n\nMagic isn't my thing.
{{55049764-16-16269:}}Our time together has been most impressive. Perhaps in a past life, you walked this world as a gryphon. \n\nIn the meantime, I'll try to keep the Fox from meddling too much in your other affairs. I make no promises.
{{55049764-7-15793:}}Lord Valente's alchemical laboratory must be through the caverns ahead. Let's keep looking.
{{55049764-12-15985:}}Glad you found us, comrade. I was meeting with Greenspeaker Darolith when Nantharion walked into the village like he still owned the place. Marched straight to these ruins.\n\nHe had a strange cloaked woman with him. I think that was Ithelia!
{{55049764-28-16043:}}Hear that, traveler? The crash of swords on shields, the roar of soldiers? A battle already rages for Feldagard Keep.\n\nI rode at breakneck speed to deliver news of an impending attack. Seems I arrived too late.
{{55049764-4-16045:}}Inefficient as it may be to respond to every hostile event, the situation at Feldagard Keep is urgent. The report you recovered from Hoperoot indicates an attack is imminent. Do what you can to defend the fortress. We will speak when you return.
{{55049764-0-16035:}}Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee will pay for their crimes. And Ontus will survive, despite all the death and suffering they caused just to make a profit.\n\nI couldn't have done it without you, deputy.
{{55049764-0-16039:}}Constable Yabren … they busted in right after she arrived. Mercenaries, by the looks of them. I tried to help, but I'm not the fighter I used to be.\n\nThey … they took Yabren!
{{55049764-18-15779:}}Mortal, something's wrong! Hermaeus Mora senses fates, futures, winking out of existence. Potentials he predicted that will never be! I feel these instabilities rippling across reality. This must be Ithelia's doing, but we need to be certain!
{{55049764-18-15778:}}Do not worry, proxy. Scruut's plan is sound, if a bit incomplete. We shall work out the pertinent details and relay them to our allies before they meet up with you.\n\nWe shall rendezvous at Beragon's townhouse after you restore the relics.
{{55049764-10-15793:}}You speak with the captive. I'll make sure no one catches us by surprise.
{{55049764-10-15798:}}Everything is just as I found it. Aquilia was very clear that she did not want to disturb any evidence. I hope you find some answers.
{{55049764-7-16255:}}That Fox came around, and he's maybe the sweetest person I've met in years. Who would have thought a Daedric creature could be like that?
{{55049764-7-16257:}}We must find the count's lost bear cub. He's somewhere in the devastated area.
{{55049764-7-15782:}}I think we found the source of those bugs in the garden. Somewhere down here is that portal Legionary Caepio spotted. For the security of Skingrad and West Weald, we need to close it.\n\nKeep pressing forward. Don't let any obstacles deter us.
{{55049764-7-15781:}}It's hard to miss Silorn. The whole place has a stench about it, doesn't it? Musky, but almost sweet? I abhor how hungry it makes me.
{{55049764-7-15786:}}I was hoping to get a better look at these ruins, but Tribune Alea is correct. Someone needs to watch our flank. Good luck in there!
{{55049764-7-15785:}}Another corner of Oblivion I never expected to visit. And it makes me just as uncomfortable as the other places we've traveled.\n\nI suggest we make haste, my friend.
{{55049764-3-16035:}}If they left a key sitting out in the open, who are we to ignore it? Take the key, deputy, and see if it unlocks any of the drawers in that desk.
{{55049764-3-16039:}}Welcome to the Stonechip Tavern and Gambling Den, stranger. Looking for work in Ontus? Or did you come to our fine establishment because you heard we host the best games of chance this side of the Strid?
{{55049764-2-15801:}}I have a bad feeling, mortal. True, I have a bad feeling about most things, but this is different. Badder. More bad.
{{55049764-2-15800:}}Let us examine the scene. Hopefully something here can explain what befell Edric.
{{55049764-2-15802:}}Another task, another danger to deal with. It never ends, does it, proxy?\n\nGo on. Talk to Scruut and see what else the One Who Knows requires of us.
{{55049764-2-15807:}}Valente certainly loves his games, but his offer was too good to ignore.
{{55049764-2-15806:}}I'm not sure I want to drink anything else offered to me by a vampire, but I suppose Fennorian can be trusted. With this matter at least.
{{55049764-2-15809:}}The auction will begin shortly.
{{55049764-25-15802:}}Keep going, proxy. The path presented by the Skein is clear enough to follow.
{{55049764-12-16043:}}I refuse to let Daedra take this keep, comrade. Let's hunt down the hole they climbed in through and plug it.
{{55049764-11-16043:}}That has to be their commander. Shardmarshal Vargas. Did you see how she opened a portal with that sword? Reinforcements emerged from some place she called Mirrormoor. That's how they got in down here.\n\nWe need to get that blade to stop the assault.
{{55049764-13-16162:}}I hope no one does anything rash until we can calm down these Goblins.
{{55049764-18-15983:}}I see my reputation precedes me. Well, someone needs to get some answers from these people!\n\nGo on, talk to the so-called king of Dawnwood. Maybe ask him who exactly crowned him while you're at it.
{{55049764-26-15793:}}The invitation indicates we're to head to the walled garden just east of the manor. I suppose that's where they're letting the guests gather prior to the start of the auction.\n\nShall we proceed?
{{55049764-2-16118:}}Don't look so surprised, comrade! The people of the Weald know how to throw a celebration!\n\nWe did good work, but I can't imagine what would have happened without your involvement. So allow us to sing your praises. You deserve it!
{{55049764-2-16112:}}Speak to Agmund and hear his argument. I'll share mine. Then give us an outsider's perspective.
{{55049764-2-16111:}}The Molag Bal Paradox is a classic. I wanted to dig into it because I know Isayas doesn't like talking about Daedra, but I also think it's a good one to pass the time.
{{55049764-4-15798:}}Please, traveler. The medicinal herbs are in the pantry, hurry.
{{55049764-5-15851:}}Go on then, ask me how I returned. It's the only question anyone seems to have for me. Uriel Weatherleah, back from the dead! It's laughable.
{{55049764-5-15850:}}Mizzik! Traveler. How fares the investigation? With so much still left to speculation, I've found myself wandering the grounds trying to keep my hands busy. I hope to have things settled soon, for all our sakes.
{{55049764-5-15852:}}Thank you for helping save Betu. Seeing both you and Otho spring into action while I just stood here quivering. You've opened my eyes, traveler.
{{55049764-5-15855:}}Hold a moment, traveler. I'm afraid the town isn't safe. As the Baroness of Leftwheal, I must insist you find shelter with the evacuated civilians.\n\nI won't risk anyone else getting hurt under my watch.
{{55049764-5-15857:}}This is the passage the captain suggested we use. He took me through it as one of my first training sessions. It's not the usual way we get into and out of the fort, so maybe the bandits haven't noticed it yet.\n\nBesides, it's full of bears.
{{55049764-5-15856:}}Now it becomes clear. The Recollection also seeks Ithelia. They hope to find her visiting places she once knew, just as we did.\n\nYet Ithelia seems confused. I do not think she has fully regained her memories or truly understands what happened to her.
{{55049764-3-16208:}}Ah … I'm sorry. Everything hurts at the moment. Thank you for saving me, friend. Arm or no arm, I have my life, and I'm grateful for it.\n\nAlthough I don't think I'll be teaching Noraine archery, after all.
{{55049764-3-16207:}}Thank you for bringing all these precious creatures back to me. Still, I wonder about Marcien. It's not like them to be gone this long. \n\nI would check on them myself, but I can't leave my pets behind. They need me here.
{{55049764-3-16206:}}What have I done? Oh, gods, Valenia! What cursed drink made me split us up! We walked right into Marcan Caelum's trap.\n\nLeave me be. Please!
{{55049764-3-16205:}}Poor Valenia, taken in answer for our gravest mistake. She was just telling me of her family. A family she hoped to finally mend after so many years apart.\n\nI … I need a moment with my thoughts, friend.
{{55049764-3-16204:}}This … this can't be real. It's some terrible dream. It must be! I'll take off this eye patch and wake up, bruised and beaten by the Legion in some alley. Please, let it be that!\n\nOh, gods. Valenia's gone.
{{55049764-3-16202:}}There are some inscriptions here that Llaren's always wanted to study. I'll take a few rubbings for him. Might make for a nice surprise. Go on! I'll catch up.
{{55049764-0-16241:}}The Netch acts in good faith. Some have found its attitude … irksome, but I believe its intentions are pure.\n\nI hope more come to walk these halls with the passion of the Netch.
{{55049764-0-16242:}}I never fully understood Ulfsild's mind, you know. She was brilliant, beyond even me. \n\nBut her legacy is no riddle to me. Scribing is a universe all its own. And now it is yours.
{{55049764-0-16243:}}Tha—tha—thank you, traveler. I—I can't thank you enough for getting us out of there!
{{55049764-0-16244:}}Florian here seems to be suffering the worst from our ordeal. I think all of us will need time to fully recover.\n\nThank you, stranger. You and your friend really came through for us.
{{55049764-0-16245:}}Sariyaah and I have been friends for years. It took a lot to convince her to leave Craglorn, so I'll do anything to make her happy here.\n\nI just hope she has enough pets for the time being.
{{55049764-0-16246:}}And so another Luminary has blessed the altar. The Scholarium remembers its ancient shape, and wants to return to days of old.\n\nUlfsild would be proud to see her dream breathing new life.
{{55049764-0-16247:}}We did it! The Netch, who would have thought?
{{55049764-0-16248:}}Look where you are, Not-Ulfsild. At everything you've done. \n\nThere is no moment more buoyant than the culmination of a person's legacy.
{{55049764-0-16249:}}Thank you.\n\nNow I'm going to spend the remaining time with my father catching him up on everything.
{{55049764-11-16170:}}Ulfsild's secrets are all around us. You need only know where to look.\n\nRead the Fable of the Indrik, then use the lens and re-examine the tome. You'll see what I mean.
{{55049764-6-15772:}}I was hoping for a cohort of legionaries from Skingrad, but you'll have to do. I don't even know where to begin. Our entire shipment of Blue Aedral is gone and my dear Lazen is still in there, chasing down whoever attacked us.
{{55049764-6-15778:}}We cannot let the loss of Gadayn deter us from our purpose. Place the fragment in the ritual circle.
{{55049764-0-15979:}}Know that you have done everything I asked of you and more, chosen. You far exceeded my considerable expectations.\n\nNow, with reality preserved and set right, we have one last matter to deal with.
{{55049764-0-15978:}}<<<1>> gibbers excitedly and nods toward <<2>>.>
{{55049764-0-15973:}}Good to see you, my friend. The townhouse is quiet now that Torvesard, Vargas, and Nantharion have been dealt with. I thought I'd like it this way, but I miss the company.\n\nWe should go traveling together again soon. I could use the excitement.
{{55049764-0-15972:}}I thought I was done with mortals, but the Great Eye assigned me to assist and observe Leramil—for the foreseeable future! Do you know how long that is? Hermaeus Mora's sight extends very far indeed!\n\nAt least she doesn't annoy me as much as some.
{{55049764-0-15971:}}Let's get out of here before the Recollection figures out what we've been doing. I'll meet you back at my townhouse in Skingrad.
{{55049764-0-15970:}}You seem like the brave sort. I for one haven't the stomach for blades and beasts, and right now, Leftwheal has more than its fair share.
{{55049764-0-15977:}}<<1>> has been much more attentive since we got back. I think she even missed <<2>>, if you can believe that.\n\nI may have to get lost more often. I do so love the way she dotes upon me. Anyway, thanks again.
{{55049764-0-15976:}}<<1>> loves that whistle. She comes running whenever we blow it.\n\nI'm sure <<2>> just got caught up examining an interesting piece of carved stone, but I appreciate you going to check on him. I'll just wait here in case they return.
{{55049764-0-15975:}}We'll meet you at the Wendir ruins, comrade. We'll follow you wherever Ithelia's trail takes us.
{{55049764-10-16247:}}Thanks for all you're doing to help restore the Scholarium. If there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.
{{55049764-8-15998:}}The One Who Knows will not speak to me. A sure sign that Hermaeus Mora dares not offer us guidance for fear of engendering the very outcome he desperately hopes to avoid.
{{55049764-3-15983:}}This way, comrade! Hurry!
{{55049764-1-16233:}}Now this is a celebration that's more to my liking. Plus, it's good business to get to know some of the other movers and shakers of the Weald. Perhaps I'll even get to make conversation with the count. I'm sure he'll find me captivating!
{{55049764-1-16236:}}When I heard about this party, I decided to make my way to the city and offer my regards, too.\n\nNice to see all the folks you helped here. I guess helping my little inn was only one step in what sounds like an epic adventure!
{{55049764-1-16238:}}Tribune Alea ordered me to attend your party! Messenger, party-goer … it's degrading! Well, now that we're done with your heroics, maybe I can get back to being a soldier again. Wouldn't that be nice!\n\nWe are sure we won, right?
{{55049764-11-16178:}}I sense the power of the Scholarium within you. Your ink-stained hands have touched the altar's magic. \n\nI sensed, too, when Ulfsild's essence faded from this realm. After all these years, do you hope to be her inheritor?
{{55049764-11-16255:}}It only took cross-referencing three tomes to figure out this echo might be about the Gryphon. Best find out what it has to say.
{{55049764-2-16329:}}The Innkeeper has me busting my bones cleaning this place up!
{{55049764-2-16328:}}Finally, some peace and quiet around here.
{{55049764-2-16321:}}You probably want to speak to Orissa. The sooner you settle your business, the sooner we can put this buzzing nightmare behind us.
{{55049764-2-16325:}}The innkeeper still serves ale and the fire's still warm. That's what matters.
{{55049764-2-16327:}}Everything is fine when you have a lute!
{{55049764-2-16326:}}People come to an inn for privacy, not to meet people!
{{55049764-12-16011:}}I don't know what our enemies are planning next for West Weald. But whatever it is, I'll meet it blade in hand. We're not defeated yet.
{{55049764-12-16010:}}These crystalline growths are clearly of Mirrormoor. Evidence of Ithelia's passing, I suspect.
{{55049764-14-16205:}}You're still alive, thank the Eight. I began praying for you the moment I saw you enter the Watch.\n\nDid you find the thief who took my ring?
{{55049764-3-15857:}}Remember, we need to find the communique with the proper chime sequence, the key to the bell tower, and the cohort payroll.\n\nJust keep an eye out for those bandits. And the bears.
{{55049764-3-15856:}}Beragon has graciously offered us the use of his townhouse as a base from which to conduct our investigations. Speak with him, please. I know he is curious about what you discovered.
{{55049764-3-15855:}}Thank you for the aid, traveler. Return to me when you've stopped their rituals and freed who you can. The sooner we save everyone and put a stop to the Recollection the better. I just wish I had done more to prevent this.
{{55049764-3-15854:}}That mirror … it showed me the truth. I have become the monster that Mora predicted. And I remember. I saw it, too. As Mora sealed my prison all those eons ago, I realized at the end … he was right.\n\nI am the Last Tomorrow.
{{55049764-3-15852:}}Don't worry. I'll take care of all the remaining paperwork and help get Otho, and Betu, on their feet. Thank you for everything you've done today. I hope my dear aunt can rest easy now.
{{55049764-3-15851:}}I think the evidence speaks for itself. My mother's death was the work of a disturbed man who later killed himself when his guilt got the better of him.
{{55049764-3-15850:}}I've committed no wrong! That man was an imposter. If I hadn't gotten him first, then he would've killed me. I spit on Theophan Pictor's name for masquerading as my dear Uriel.
{{55049764-9-16043:}}I could still leap this railing and rush her if you think that would work. No, let's stick with the plan I outlined.\n\nOnce you're in position at the gateway, I'll distract the shardmarshal. Let's do this.
{{55049764-5-16266:}}You made it! Sorry about all the cobwebs and cult guys, but this is the closest I could get us to Nocturnal's realm. Let's make this quick so we can get out of here.
{{55049764-6-15987:}}Leramil's back! You should tell her what happened in Miscarcand, friend. Maybe she's got an idea about where Ithelia went or what she's likely to do next.
{{55049764-6-15981:}}Any adventurer who delves into Ayleid ruins knows the name Miscarcand. It was a great Ayleid city, but it's been lost for ages. If Nantharion is truly descended from its ancient rulers, that would explain the Recollection's fascination with Ayleids.
{{55049764-6-15983:}}The Recollection had someone close to the king, all right. Nantharion's been laughing at us all along!\n\nCome on. We need to burn that seed and settle accounts with that two-faced skeever!
{{55049764-20-16043:}}It's good to see Commander Merian alive and barking orders. We can trust his leadership.\n\nFind out what he needs from us. I'll defend against attacking Daedra.
{{55049764-25-15778:}}You must hear what Scruut has to say, proxy. We do not yet know if this latest doom is tied to Ithelia and Torvesard, but I suspect the chances of that are very good.
{{55049764-26-15802:}}Follow the path the Skein has set before us. While it cannot pinpoint Ithelia's exact location, we know it can lead us to places where her power has recently been active.
{{55049764-30-15800:}}You should share what you discovered with <<1>>. She is the only inheritor left for her aunt's estate.
{{55049764-23-16043:}}Damn! The Daedra have surrounded the keep and breached the fort's outer wall. The situation is worse than I thought.\n\nWe need to get in there and help them!
{{55049764-14-15971:}}Things look different from what I remember, but I'm sure I'll recognize the right path as soon as I see it.\n\nLet's keep moving.
{{55049764-7-16118:}}I stand ready to assist you, comrade. We must place the Lamp near a reality tear before you cast the spell. There should be one inside this cavern.
{{55049764-1-16009:}}It looks like we found a place where we can use Abolisher. Go ahead and give it a try—anywhere it takes us has got to be better than here.
{{55049764-5-16061:}}I'm trying to keep hope alive in my heart, traveler. Like a Grahtwood fisher cub in a pen, I'm feeding it the fish of my soul.
{{55049764-5-16060:}}Maybe there's still some way forward here. What is a marriage but a hope for a better tomorrow? And Vashabar itself is a symbol of hope.
{{55049764-1-16005:}}Despite how I feel right now, you and I did some real good in Ostumir. And we kept this weird seed out of the hands of the Recollection. So, wins all around, I say.\n\nIf you're ever in Skingrad, come visit me at my townhouse.
{{55049764-5-16062:}}I've seen you running to and fro, traveler. On a quest to help our young couple, I believe.\n\nHow goes the journey?
{{55049764-1-16003:}}I heard you agree to help the Wood Elf find more survivors. Do your best to find everyone you can, please. Those are our neighbors and friends trapped down there.\n\nI'll tend to any wounded up here. Don't worry, I won't leave anyone behind.
{{55049764-1-16002:}}Is that it? Do we have what we need now to … how did Leramil put it? Save all of existence?\n\nI can hardly comprehend the threat we're facing, comrade.
{{55049764-2-16286:}}I think this is it, my friend. Get ready. Who knows what the Crow has in store for you.
{{55049764-2-16287:}}It's you! Hi! It's me! When the Gryphon told me you'd entered the Crow's wing I knew you needed me. \n\nAfter all, Ulfsild told me you would! I'm supposed to help you get past this next bit.
{{55049764-2-16282:}}I hope I … I hope Ulfsild left something of herself behind, where you're going.
{{55049764-4-16180:}}You can't let the Recollection gain a foothold here. Wipe them out.
{{55049764-17-15793:}}Lord Valente is well and truly into the auction now, so we have a bit of time. I never expected to find Ursilia here with you, though.\n\nWhat did you discover? And what did she mean by deal with her husband?
{{55049764-31-15800:}}This one briefly inspected the library before the will became the investigation's focus. We have learned much since then. Perhaps we will discover there's more to the scene than Mizzik once thought.
{{55049764-12-15793:}}I'm glad you're back. Did you find everything we need?
{{55049764-12-15800:}}This one has read many wills in his time, but a riddle? And one that hides a fortune? This is a first. Mizzik could use another set of keen eyes. Perhaps you will see something that this one has missed.
{{55049764-6-16062:}}Well met. Vashabar … and Valenwood … welcomes you warmly.
{{55049764-6-16060:}}I have so much respect for Minth. It kills me to think he won't listen to his own son. And when everything we've worked for is so close at hand.
{{55049764-22-15782:}}Once more, I designate you as a temporary agent of the West Weald Legion. Keep this up and I may just make you enlist.\n\nWe'll search the manor house first. I'll meet you there. Just stay alert, comrade. We don't know what happened here.
{{55049764-7-15800:}}We must speak to <<1>>. He discovered <<2>>'s body.
{{55049764-4-16020:}}If we allow the tangle in fate to persist, our localized reality could collapse. In short, we would all cease to exist.\n\nEnter the inn while I research this phenomenon. And, hurry, proxy. Even at this distance, the disturbance causes me great pain.
{{55049764-4-16023:}}Terrible sight seeing Master Grander deflated like this. Perhaps some tea would raise his spirits.
{{55049764-2-15968:}}Any raw recruit can carry messages. I'm an experienced legionary! I should be out there, fighting for the glory of count and country!
{{55049764-2-15969:}}If I'm right, Nantharion is planning to set off a massive wildburn, enough to destroy Skingrad and cover the entire Weald in forest!\n\nTake a look at the Skein and you'll see the sites I'm referring to. I think they can lead us to Nantharion.
{{55049764-2-15966:}}I knew you were special the moment I met you, proxy. No, you are proxy no more. You are just … my friend. We stopped Vaermina and Peryite, defeated Torvesard, saved Necrom and West Weald. But I feel there was something else. Something important.
{{55049764-2-15965:}}Whoever's behind these attacks on West Weald—Daedra, Wood Elf, or Recollection fanatic—I mean to make them answer for what they've done. This land is my home, and I'll fight to protect it.
{{55049764-2-15960:}}My sword tasted Balandrus's blood and we ended the Terror. Let's head outside and find Tham.
{{55049764-17-15971:}}I knew the Recollection was interested in Niryastare, but I didn't really expect to find a whole new fort blocking access to the ruins. Maybe we'll find a way in that they overlooked.
{{55049764-6-16269:}}Mortal! Welcome back. Standing against injustice is a reward all its own, but you have my thanks as well.\n\nThe time I've had with my oldest and dearest friend has been a balm on my heart. And together, we've come up with a plan.
{{55049764-6-16264:}}I'm stuck here while they tally my tab. It could be a while.\n\nTry looking for my fear somewhere secluded, like a cave or ruin. I think she's southwest of Ontus.
{{55049764-6-16266:}}It makes sense, the way to the Deadlands being in a burnt-up village.\n\nI decided to hide up here until you arrived. I'm being careful, see?
{{55049764-29-15793:}}The new grapes are certainly unusual. Let's keep looking around before we jump to any conclusions.
{{55049764-13-16043:}}We crushed the Daedra's frontal assault and stopped them from getting past the barricade. But the one's who emerged from the barracks—where did they come from?
{{55049764-3-16128:}}I hope this is the start of something momentous. For the first time, I truly believe there can be trust, even friendship, between Skingrad and Vashabar. I would like to think Greenspeaker Darolith feels the same.
{{55049764-3-16129:}}That unmarked wing is unlocked, is it? How exciting! I'm eager to hear what sort of trial awaits you on the other side.
{{55049764-3-16127:}}You saved Dawnwood from suffering, war, and ruin. The Tree-sap People thank you.
{{55049764-3-16125:}}My patience with you has reached its end, pathwalker. Soon, Mora's forces will storm this place and imprison me for an eternity. I suggest you not be here when they arrive.
{{55049764-9-16247:}}The Crow has warmed up to me, which is great. But now she wants to start tutoring me. It's like I'm back in my mother's home again.\n\nHow goes your trial with the Netch?
{{55049764-19-15983:}}If Beragon insists we go see this so-called king, let's make it quick. We don't know how much time we have before the Recollection strikes again.
{{55049764-18-16204:}}I think we'll get along, friend. Here, let me mark your map. I know where you can find three of the surviving Scarlets: Big Urm, Fallen-Knives, and Valenia.\n\nTell them to go to the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge. I'll be waiting there.
{{55049764-18-16205:}}It's a strange thing. After twenty years, are the Divines giving us a chance to make amends? Or is this their judgment on what we did?\n\nIt would only be just.
{{55049764-18-16206:}}My scales are dry enough to make a Veeskhleel blush. And the barkeep says I can't afford the good stuff. Spare a coin so a self-loathing wretch can drink himself into Oblivion?
{{55049764-7-15852:}}I'm sorry. I've just, I've never seen …. I'll gather my wits, I just need a moment.
{{55049764-3-16321:}}Oh my fragile heart! Orissa's going back in there? Didn't she see the size of those terrible bugs?
{{55049764-2-16043:}}Mirrormoor and Shardborn. Two words I never knew existed before all this. We should tell Beragon and Leramil what happened here. I expect one of them can tell us more about Abolisher. I'm headed to Skingrad. May I take the blade for them to examine?
{{55049764-2-16045:}}Tell Beragon about your recent investigations, proxy. I confess I am curious as to what he makes of your report on the events at the Outcast Inn.\n\nAfterward, we must take counsel together.
{{55049764-27-15960:}}Either the Terror and his gang haven't checked here yet, or they haven't been able to breach the vault. That doesn't mean they won't be back though, so let's be quick.\n\nHelnzin the clerk kept a spare key to the vault in a box by her desk.
{{55049764-12-16162:}}Hiring hunters isn't the way to solve this problem. I know that Goblins can be unnerving if you aren't used to them, but wiping out two camps is going too far. \n\nDo you have a moment to help me with this Goblin problem?
{{55049764-5-16286:}}It's the Fox! Every time I see that little guy I can't help but have a smile on my face.
{{55049764-11-16118:}}I'm not sure I appreciate being whisked through Oblivion portals without so much as a by your leave!\n\nStill, it appears our efforts were successful. Talk to Leramil, then you can fill the rest of us in on what exactly happened.
{{55049764-23-15983:}}I see you got my message. Good. The Wood Elf was just telling me about a strange seed you found at Ostumir. If that can explain how that new forest grew up so quickly, we should look into that. \n\nTalk to Beragon and find out what else he knows.
{{55049764-2-16206:}}I'm worried about Hooke. Him and Val, they were always close. Even all the way back when we were legionaries in good standing.\n\nGods, what a mess.
{{55049764-2-16207:}}Marcien's been helping me settle in since I arrived. It doesn't feel right without them here.\n\nWho knows what trouble they might have run into? I hate thinking about it. Please, find them for me.
{{55049764-2-16204:}}Thank you for helping me save those I could. Any life lost is my own doing. Valenia … Naku … the rest of the Scarlets.\n\nI have to take responsibility for who I used to be.
{{55049764-2-16205:}}Valenia's family will want her body back. I believe Hooke plans to take her to Marbruk. I'll go too, and say a few words when we lay her to rest there.\n\nAnd that may be the last time I speak to the Divines.
{{55049764-2-16202:}}Listen, I climbed plenty of trees back home, and I'm nothing if not committed. Let's not talk about it.\n\nDid you find Ulfsild's notes?
{{55049764-2-16208:}}I can't believe I'm here. I was only out of sight of Fallen-Knives and Big Urm for a moment when Caelum grabbed me and dragged me into a hole. The tunnels were dark, but he knew his way.\n\nI was sure I was done for. Then you and Hooke showed up.
{{55049764-2-16209:}}That was a harrowing fight, I am sure. I only wish I could have been here.
{{55049764-9-16014:}}The hunt is on, faithful assistant! With those notes, it's clear that the Recollection is stymied by that altar. I, of course, know how to activate it. We'll need a vial of blood, some sacred water and/or wine from the things they've dug up.
{{55049764-9-16010:}}I believe these crystals are manifestations of Ithelia's power. Her mere proximity is beginning to reshape her surroundings.\n\nWhether she intended to or not, Ithelia has left a trail we can follow.
{{55049764-9-16011:}}We've come this far, comrade. Wherever that portal leads, It's time to finish this. Let's go.
{{55049764-26-16266:}}You did it! The … thing everyone wanted you to do. I forget.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy to call you my friend!
{{55049764-9-16162:}}Losing a shaman is enough to cause uncertainty within a Goblin camp. But losing their totem too? No wonder this camp is so violent. \n\nI have some theories but nothing conclusive ….
{{55049764-1-16328:}}I visit the inn to do some reading and sometimes to work on my novel. Usually it's filled with people drinking and making noise.\n\nNow with the other customers scared off, it's perfect for me.
{{55049764-1-16329:}}How does Brynmir expect me to get work done with these odd happenings going on? I can't clean now! I'm just too scared. Yeah, that's it. Too scared to do my work.\n\nThat's a good excuse, right?
{{55049764-1-16326:}}Can I see them? Yes. Did I notice the sky as I walked in? Yes. Am I concerned that something horrible could happen here? Yes.\n\nDo I want to talk to you about it? No.
{{55049764-1-16327:}}Keep playing. Just keep playing. They won't hurt you unless you stop the music.\n\nI don't know why I believe that. But I haven't stopped for a moment and I'm still safe.
{{55049764-1-16325:}}Brynmir seems upset. Why? Do those odd wandering people bother him? Just leave them alone.\n\nMaybe they want a drink. Has he tried that?
{{55049764-1-16321:}}Oh dear. I can see that Orissa's temper is brewing. I'll just mind my own business, shall I?
{{55049764-14-16184:}}It's good to be back! I know it took some time to get us all down here, apologies.\n\nArchmage Galerion and the Votary Commander needed significant convincing to turn this into a full-fledged expedition. How did it go with the Crow?
{{55049764-14-16183:}}I'm sure it doesn't look like you're interrupting me, but you are. \n\nI've got things to tend to, and I'm sure you do too.
{{55049764-14-16182:}}Plenty to do in a place of this size. Corridors to patrol, books to organize. Keeps me busy! Though likely not as busy as you.
{{55049764-0-16068:}}Oh … urgh … hello there. Where are you and who are we?
{{55049764-0-16062:}}Respect and deep thanks, traveler. Laeni and Clendagal shall remain in Vashabar. And it's all because of you. \n\nMay Y'ffre guard and keep you in your journey.
{{55049764-13-15981:}}I had a feeling you'd return soon. The Skein of Secrets changed while I was studying it. The sites I sent you to investigate faded away. I presume you accomplished something at both locations?\n\nTell me, what did you find?
{{55049764-13-15983:}}There's more going on here than an attack on the Dawnwood king. This place isn't a settlement, it's a damned fortress! And the Recollection have an army in here!\n\nWe need to look around and figure out what's actually going on here.
{{55049764-13-15985:}}Lead the way, comrade. I'm right behind you.
{{55049764-6-16118:}}Go ahead. Place the Lamp of Clarity near the tear in reality. Just do so carefully.
{{55049764-0-15807:}}Finally, this song and dance is over and we can get to business. Do tell your master I look forward to measuring my coin against his.
{{55049764-0-15806:}}I suppose I should thank you. Even Fennorian came through for me this time. My husband's foul operation is finished and his coven—is that really what he called it?—will scatter before long.\n\nNow begins the hard work of restoring this vineyard.
{{55049764-0-15804:}}That's Master Bogvir? Not what I expected.\n\nYou should follow your master, and guest.
{{55049764-0-15802:}}While you and our allies place the relics in the prescribed locations, I shall perform a ritual to help strengthen and enhance the spell provided by the One Who Knows.\n\nI shall also think more about what Ithelia showed me before she departed.
{{55049764-0-15801:}}Each tear that splits the realm of Apocrypha is like a cut across my eyes! You and Leramil track down Ithelia. I'll gather the Watchlings and see if we can do anything to slow the inevitable destruction of all existence.
{{55049764-0-15800:}}Steady yourself as we approach the imposter Uriel. This ruse may not be his only crime. It's increasingly likely that he killed Edric to keep his secret.
{{55049764-0-15809:}}If you do talk to Master Bogvir, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to mention that I agree to his terms. Everything's set aside, as he requested.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to tend to the auction.
{{55049764-0-15808:}}I just served my last glass. But have no fear. Once I refill my tray, I'll come around again.
{{55049764-31-15793:}}Don't let the beauty of this place fool you. I sense a darkness beneath the light.
{{55049764-1-16128:}}Tribune Alea has spoken at length about you and enthralled me with tales of your exploits on behalf of West Weald. And to think you're not even a native of Skingrad or Vashabar! I hope it isn't too late for us to learn something from your example.
{{55049764-1-16129:}}You and Nahlia certainly had your work cut out for you. Well done!\n\nAnd now, with all the cataloging and reporting to superiors, I suppose I'll have my work cut out for me.
{{55049764-1-16125:}}Azura's Lamp is not a friend to Ithelia, pathwalker. All the relics work to subdue us. If it helps make a Sage's Dream, it is not to empower my reflection.\n\nNo matter. My fate here is sealed so what do I care. Take your harkfruit and leave me.
{{55049764-1-16127:}}Traveler, we hoped to see you here.\n\nI'm told you killed King Nantharion beneath Vashabar's very roots. I know he had to be stopped, yet the tragedy will haunt me. He started with a great vision before he wandered onto dark paths.
{{55049764-1-16121:}}I can't believe we did it! We saved Apocrypha and West Weald! If you told me we'd do anything like this back at the necropolis, I would have asked how much sujamma you had to drink.
{{55049764-1-16122:}}I really am quite busy. Tell Constable Yabren that I'm sorry for her loss. I'm sorry for everybody's losses.
{{55049764-1-16123:}}This so-called fatigue fever. I wouldn't be surprised if it were nothing more than an excuse used by lazy workers to avoid hard labor.\n\nNone of my best ranch hands have gotten ill. At least, not yet.
{{55049764-8-16210:}}Scrambling down an incline of this magnitude will not be a simple matter. \n\nYou take it at your own pace and Keshargo will take it at his.
{{55049764-19-16021:}}When you left, I was compelled to follow. I saw an image of you entering this chamber and I knew I had to be here with you.\n\nBut then this awful lamp appeared. Rudely popping out of nowhere. I hate the damned thing!
{{55049764-0-16149:}}Tribune Alea did well when she brought you to help us at Feldagard. All of the Weald is in your debt, mercenary. If not for you, who knows what this Recollection and Daedra business would have led to.\n\nStill, it seems I'm forgetting something ….
{{55049764-0-16148:}}I hope you don't mind, but we crashed your party. A friendly legionary mentioned it to me and offered to help get Narsis here. Said his name was Caepio, I think. Nice fellow. He really liked my hair.\n\nAs you can see, poor Narsis is still petrified.
{{55049764-0-16147:}}Talk to Maer. Let her know I don't blame her. Tell her I'm … all right.
{{55049764-0-16145:}}You're the one Nahlia's been waiting for? You're not what I expected. But perhaps that's just what she needs.
{{55049764-0-16144:}}Flee while you can, mortal. Save your own life. Just spare a thought for this doomed path if you survive. I suspect we will not last much longer.\n\nI suggest you take the lute berries and run. Good luck.
{{55049764-4-16035:}}My father wanted to clear this place out, but it was never a priority for the town leaders. Let's see what Carvain and Raxalee have hidden down here.
{{55049764-22-16021:}}I remember so little about myself. Why is that? Did someone … yes, Mora! He did this!\n\nBut Sage's Dream. I know it can help me, even as the details slip away. Please ask the innkeeper. I feel certain he knows something.
{{55049764-7-16021:}}With each remembrance, the storm calms a bit more and my power returns to me. You see how I opened a doorway into the Many Paths? I am gaining more control with each passing moment. All I need is Sage's Dream to complete the process.
{{55049764-7-16020:}}Greetings, proxy. I see that you too have been drawn to this place. Do you sense the tangled threads of fate converging upon the Outcast Inn? Already the bonds of cause and effect fray here. Should these bonds snap, the result would be catastrophic.
{{55049764-20-15782:}}That's Captain Leronus lying on the floor. He commanded the cohort when I wasn't with them. He was a good soldier.\n\nI found that letter clutched in his hand. You should read it.
{{55049764-19-15782:}}The bloody clothes and the warning candle suggest someone or something attacked Rustwall. And we know Captain Leronus was working on a plan. I hoped to find him alive, but the letter from the groundskeeper tells us more than we knew before.
{{55049764-9-15983:}}That stone you carry triggered a vision! How did you do that? Who was the woman?
{{55049764-9-15981:}}I wouldn't have noticed that passage if we hadn't examined that poor beast. We'd better see where the passage leads.
{{55049764-19-15786:}}It would be easy to blame Daedra for everything, but there's plenty of evil to go around across Tamriel that has nothing to do with Oblivion.\n\nI wish we could be dealing with some of that right now, truth be told.
{{55049764-4-16005:}}I couldn't catch her. I've known Sorilen for almost my whole life. I cared about her. Considered her a friend … perhaps more. Why didn't I see that she had been taken in by the Recollection? Maybe I could have done something.\n\nBlight, this hurts.
{{55049764-8-15782:}}Legionary Caepio made it this far. We need to trust that he can continue to evade the enemy for a while longer.\n\nLet's find these ruins he spotted down below and find a way to deal with that portal.
{{55049764-8-15785:}}I came … as fast as I could. Scruut's trinket got me from Apocrypha to Nirn, but it deposited me some distance from this location.\n\nAnd I meant what I said. I want to help, anyway I can.
{{55049764-14-16035:}}Something is very wrong in the town of Ontus. I feel it in my bones.
{{55049764-21-15782:}}Rustwall Manor is usually pristine. The staff would never leave so much as a chair out of place. Not willingly, at any rate.\n\nLet's look around. We need to find anything that suggests what happened here.
{{55049764-4-15779:}}Be sure to follow Leramil's instructions to the letter.\n\nI'm pretty sure nothing bad will happen if you don't, but you never can tell with cobbled together rituals.
{{55049764-4-15778:}}You must help me align the threads of fate to complete the ritual.
{{55049764-4-15772:}}Tread with caution, friend. Those ruffians may be the least of our worries. I didn't get a good look, but they had some vicious sounding creatures with them.
{{55049764-9-16276:}}You did it! They're pointing but I don't see anything. Maybe there's one of those focal points nearby?
{{55049764-1-15859:}}I can't believe we found a corrupted seed at Ostumir. That the Recollection somehow caused the new forest to overgrow West Weald. Or that my friend Sorilen was involved.\n\nLeramil wants to talk to you, but I'd like to hear what else you discovered.
{{55049764-1-15855:}}I'll continue to do all I can for Leftwheal. The fact that I have a second chance is thanks to you. Your aid went a long way to ensure we have a future to look forward to. Once we've dealt with all the remaining cultists of course.
{{55049764-1-15854:}}My very nature makes returning me to prison a temporary reprieve at best. My power will always find a way back to me. And with it, the threat of the madness that overcomes me and can unravel reality.\n\nMortal, talk with me more about change.
{{55049764-1-15857:}}Just ring the bell in the proper sequence and that will alert the rest of the Legion.
{{55049764-1-15856:}}Speak with Beragon. See if he has a thought about our next steps.\n\nIthelia's presence untethers all consequences. It makes it nearly impossible for me to perceive the threads of fate, let alone determine which threads to follow.
{{55049764-1-15851:}}Losing my late mother's will has got everyone on edge. Hopefully it turns up soon and we can have this uncomfortable business taken care of. Then we can discuss more lighthearted matters such as a celebration of my return.
{{55049764-1-15850:}}I'm sorry, I didn't see you and the investigator there. This search for the will is rattling my nerves! Please let us know at once when you find it.
{{55049764-1-15852:}}You can find Mizzik just down the road, searching the Weatherleah Estate for Betu. He has quite a distinct look, you can't miss him. Khajiit wearing a broad brimmed hat and big heavy boots. Quite the flair for the dramatic if you ask me.
{{55049764-10-15840:}}Well, at least she's finally talking. That's better than I ever managed.\n\nI hope you told her to get out of here. My remaining customers are starting to talk about settling their bill and finding someplace less strange.
{{55049764-16-15793:}}Head downstairs and scout the area. I'll follow along shortly. I need to try to … make things right with Ursilia. And maybe I have something in my alchemy kit to deal with the wine in her system. Just the smell of it makes me … hungry.
{{55049764-3-16041:}}If you're looking for work, please talk to Quarry Boss Laurina. I have more important things to do than deal with common laborers.
{{55049764-3-16043:}}Mirrormoor and Shardborn. Two words I never knew existed before all this. I have a lot of questions and not a lot of answers.\n\nI'd like to take Abolisher to Skingrad to have it examined by an expert I know. Is that all right with you, comrade?
{{55049764-3-16042:}}The Carvain Ranch does not sell to individual buyers. This is not a general store. Might I suggest the markets in Skingrad? Or perhaps you can purchase a meal at the Stonechip Tavern?
{{55049764-3-16045:}}The tangled threads of fate I sense around the Outcast Inn fill me with dread. Something dangerous and momentous is happening.\n\nI will meet you there, proxy.
{{55049764-11-15960:}}Let's find those weapon stockpiles and blast them straight to Oblivion!
{{55049764-7-16043:}}I have no idea where we are or when she'll be back. Maybe we can use the blade she called Abolisher to get back? Grab it and see if you can make it work like Vargas did.
{{55049764-12-16206:}}I admit, I wasn't sold on the story Hooke sent you with. But … he's changed. His eye's sharp like it used to be, but honest now.\n\nWhatever plan he has in mind, I'm in. Provided he buys the drinks.
{{55049764-12-16207:}}Look at the wings on this little guzzard! They're so tiny, and the skin is so pink! The guzzards back in Craglorn were never this cute.\n\nI'm still waiting on two other quarries from Marcien. If you find them, I'd gladly pay you for the extra help.
{{55049764-12-16204:}}I think the headstones and the locked sewer grate confirm what we expected to find—Marcan Caelum spends a lot of time here. But I can't see him living in the ruins of the house. There's just nothing left.
{{55049764-12-16205:}}Hello, friend. Thank you for helping us gather here.\n\nHooke just told us what he's learned, and he's right to worry. I fear a sudden knife from every stranger I pass. But perhaps it is meant to be, Eight keep me.
{{55049764-10-16002:}}Scruut told us you went back to the Loom. I'm glad to see you all returned unscathed. Go, tell Scruut what you found there.
{{55049764-17-16178:}}I have enjoyed the peace, the solitude. But it warms my heart to hear footsteps echo through the Scholarium once again. \n\nUlfsild learned many lessons about power and its application here. I hope you, and your cohorts, do the same.
{{55049764-11-16011:}}We'll meet you at the Wendir ruins, comrade. We'll follow you wherever Ithelia's trail takes us.
{{55049764-2-16121:}}The last thing I remember, friend, we were exploring an Ayleid ruin, looking for … something. To stop … hmm. The more I try to remember, the less I can recall.\n\nWhat happened to me, my friend?
{{55049764-2-16127:}}Greetings, friend of Beragon. I have to say I don't care much for houses made from cut wood and shaped stone. Beragon has been too long away from the forest, if you ask me. \n\nAnyway, he's expecting you. You'll find him in the nearby room.
{{55049764-2-16125:}}No, you do not belong here. But a reflection of the Prince of Paths travels with you. Have you come to revel at my defeat? To watch Hermaeus Mora imprison me? How shameful that I attract a mocking audience.\n\nGet on with your gloating then.
{{55049764-2-16129:}}I saw everyone gathered, so I assumed there must be something going on!
{{55049764-2-16128:}}Your exploits precede you, hero. Impressive tales! And I understand we owe you a great deal.\n\nBeragon is waiting for you in the other room. Come back once you finish with our gracious host. I would like to speak with you.
{{55049764-11-16130:}}This is just like what happened when I first found the portal.
{{55049764-3-15960:}}Balandrus and his lieutenants know we're coming. And they've got Tham. Our best option is to strike fast and strike hard!
{{55049764-3-15966:}}I know there is a price, but my gratitude knows no bounds! Gadayn is returned!\n\nPlease, proxy. Speak to him. Determine that he is all right.
{{55049764-3-15969:}}After my initial examination of the Skein of Secrets, I still don't know what to make of it. It's a map, but the image is constantly changing. I think it reacts to whatever the viewer is looking for.\n\nI wasn't having much luck, then I had an idea.
{{55049764-18-16178:}}You are welcome in my glade any time adventurer. \n\nUse this calm and thoughtful place as a chance to consider the power you wield. And how it might be applied wisely.
{{55049764-9-16205:}}The Divines can be harsh in their judgment. So they were when we were imprisoned, and so they are now that I know why my old comrades are dead.\n\nMy heart tells me there is one more judgment to come. I will see you at the vineyard.
{{55049764-9-16204:}}Keep your wits about you. Marcan Caelum is down here with us. I'm sure of it. And it's his territory.
{{55049764-9-16207:}}I adore my little menagerie, but I've always wanted to hand raise a young guzzard. Marcien still hasn't returned with my new baby.\n\nYou've already done more than enough. But if you do happen across a young guzzard, well, you know where to find me.
{{55049764-9-16206:}}Naku's dead? He owed me a drink. Wouldn't stop talking about all the plum brandy waiting for him after we finally got out of prison.\n\nWell. Maybe there's something left at the vineyard.
{{55049764-9-16208:}}I convinced Regomor to take Noraine and return to Marbruk. He didn't need much persuading, so long as I promised to stay away until I was sure it would be safe. I suppose it's for the best.\n\nWas anyone waiting in the woods?
{{55049764-0-16238:}}Ever have one of those moments when you're suddenly sure you forgot something important? Like did I leave the fire burning in the barrack's hearth again? Or where did I put my sword?\n\nProbably nothing. Just one of those feelings, I guess.
{{55049764-0-16233:}}Is there something in the wine? The crowd suddenly seems confused, and I hear whispers that indicate many of them believe they just forgot something important.\n\nNo matter. I remember everything! Now, be a dear and introduce me to Count Calantius.
{{55049764-0-16232:}}Listening to <<1>> has been enlightening! I had no idea the Reachfolk were such accomplished healers.
{{55049764-0-16237:}}Nice party. I didn't know you were so famous.\n\nI was hoping to find a compassionate yet influential patron here to fund my research, but no luck so far. Don't worry, I won't try to wrangle funds from you. I'm much too indebted to you for that.
{{55049764-0-16236:}}Thanks again for helping me with that problem. If not for you … wait, what happened again? Oh, right, the shadows … and … was there someone else there?\n\nAnyway, you can always drink for free at the Outcast Inn! Or, at least at a deep discount.
{{55049764-8-16055:}}I see Ciiril found you. This is a happy place for us, traveler. \n\nI hope you've come with news to match.
{{55049764-8-16054:}}This place is beautiful, isn't it? You should talk to Clendagal. He's normally easy going, but he's so tense right now I'm worried he's going to bud.
{{55049764-8-16056:}}There you are. I've got a good start on gathering supplies for Laeni and Clendagal. How was your chat with the old goats?
{{55049764-8-16051:}}You'll have to cut down an enemy or two, no question. But your primary objective is to reset those traps and burn those ropes. My legionaries can handle the rest. After that, meet me in the main courtyard.\n\nIf you have questions, make them quick.
{{55049764-12-16017:}}I hesitate to employ another relic after our mishap with the Skein of Secrets, but I see no other alternative. We must risk the Lamp of Clarity if we wish to escape.
{{55049764-12-16014:}}We must search these surface ruins for two types of things: my own irreplaceable notes, and any information of the Recollection's doings. Those Wood Elves must have some papers about here; mission orders, reports, or correspondence.
{{55049764-10-16210:}}The null arca is too heavy to bring with you, so you will have to carry the arcane knot back here. This one hopes you find it quickly, Xoryn and his mercenaries have had a good while to explore on their own.\n\nKeshargo will join you when he can.
{{55049764-25-15960:}}Let's open the vault door nice and slow. Would hate to startle the survivors into doing something foolish.
{{55049764-1-16249:}}He can hear me, he knows I'm here. My father doesn't have to pass from this world alone.\n\nI'm so overwhelmed. I don't know how to thank you. What did you do?
{{55049764-1-16248:}}As my power flows through the altar, reach your tendrils out into the world, Not-Ulfsild. You never know where scribing will take you next.\n\nAnd of course, if you're lucky, we'll see each other again soon.
{{55049764-1-16241:}}Well? More tricks? Or did you find the real Fable of the Netch?
{{55049764-1-16242:}}Your tactics were unconventional. Even devious. I loved every moment of our conversations. \n\nMake clever use of my power, mortal. For Ulfsild's sake, if nothing else.
{{55049764-1-16245:}}Don't worry about me, traveler. I can handle myself now that I'm not tangled in my net. \n\nGo let Sariyaah know I'm safe. I'll catch up with you shortly. And when you see her, maybe leave out the part about the guzzards.
{{55049764-1-16247:}}Our adventure with the Netch is behind us, my friend. I'll be … digesting some of that for a while I think. \n\nJust let me know if I can be helpful.
{{55049764-1-16246:}}Fascinating how the Netch has adapted to our presence here.
{{55049764-11-16208:}}This is not a good time, stranger. If you have business with me, make it quick.
{{55049764-11-16204:}}I doubt we can get to the cellars through the sewer gate—it's locked from the other side. But we should be able to find an entrance somewhere near the ruins of the main house. Let's look around.
{{55049764-11-16207:}}That old guzzard has a true Craglorn soul, the look in its eyes says it all. I think we'll get along just fine.\n\nI asked Marcien to find two other creatures for me. I haven't seen them in a while, so I'd be happy to pay for your help again.
{{55049764-9-16017:}}Beragon is free! Ask him what became of Tribune Alea, and what he found in his journey through the Many Paths. I doubt we can escape the way he came, but it is worth asking.
{{55049764-7-16217:}}I just … need to catch my breath.
{{55049764-0-16060:}}I can't wait for the wedding. You think the village is going to get rot-faced tonight, just wait until after the ceremony!\n\nHaha. Dawn keep you traveler. Well done.
{{55049764-0-16061:}}I can't contain my joy, stranger. Laeni will stay here in Vashabar, a proud and vibrant sapling growing amid the grove of her elders.\n\nThe will of the Singer, sung through you.
{{55049764-0-16067:}}This new act we're working on is going to be quite the doozy! Hopefully you can catch it.
{{55049764-15-15802:}}The Echonir, proxy. If Ithelia's presence changed the door, the Echonir might show us a recent memory.
{{55049764-15-15800:}}At first swipe, Otho seems genuine, but one mustn't leap blindly. All evidence must be found and this pot of poisoned tea could be the key. Quickly, let us investigate Lady Weatherleah's room for clues.
{{55049764-13-16207:}}Adjusting to this new area has been difficult. I had to leave behind many friends and beloved pets in Belkarth. But I suppose I knew that would happen when I came here. Still, I miss those familiar faces.
{{55049764-13-16205:}}I'll meet with Hooke, as you ask. Although I don't have much reason to enter the Outlaws Refuge these days. May the Eight know my honest intentions!
{{55049764-13-16204:}}I don't think I have to tell you that we caused all of this. But it's high time I take responsibility for everything that happened.\n\nCome, friend. Let's search for any sign of Marcan Caelum's whereabouts.
{{55049764-3-15991:}}King Nantharion hardly knows us. If the Recollection spy—or spies—around him are people he's known for some time, it might not be easy to convince him he's in danger. Wait for us before you try to storm the place, friend.
{{55049764-5-15797:}}Ah, an old friend approaches! This one knows there are no coincidences in his line of work. Mizzik could use help solving a curious case. You wouldn't by any chance have seen a beast running about with a mouthful of parchment?
{{55049764-6-15779:}}There are a few temporal threads I need to account for while I finish determining the nature of the ritual Leramil and I developed. Talk to her for a moment and let me think.
{{55049764-15-16170:}}I'm glad you've chosen to stay, interloper. The path to master Scribing is not an easy one, but its rewards are innumerable. \n\nYour knight appears to be leaving. Did I ruffle her feathers with my caws?
{{55049764-2-15852:}}Excuse my shouting, traveler. You wouldn't happen to have seen a dog running around? Large, fluffy, carrying a very important, estate-defining scroll in his mouth?
{{55049764-2-15850:}}Everything was going fine until that idiot Theophan came bumbling back into my life.
{{55049764-2-15851:}}I didn't realize Mizzik had an assistant! A pleasure to meet you. I hope, despite the circumstances, you will find time to enjoy the estate grounds. It's beautiful this time of year. A small blessing while we grieve.
{{55049764-2-15856:}}Encountering a material conformation of … that is, I thought it would take longer for us to find and confront Ithelia in person.\n\nWe determined that my suspicions about the frayed fates proved correct. Each location had a connection to Ithelia.
{{55049764-2-15857:}}All right, we have the payroll, the chime sequence, and the tower key. We need to reach the top of the bell tower on the west side of the fort and sound the bell chimes in the proper order.\n\nWe made it this far. I can keep going if you can.
{{55049764-2-15854:}}Hermaeus Mora, the One Who Knows. For all his knowledge and foresight, his solution remains the same. To repeat our cycle. Such is the nature of the Daedra, mortal.\n\nLet us proceed.
{{55049764-2-15855:}}You've returned! I'm already getting reports of the tide of beasts waning and we're tending to the townsfolk you helped. Thank you.\n\nNow tell me, what of the Recollection? Were you able to stop their rituals?
{{55049764-2-15859:}}I gave up adventuring because I was more skilled with quill and parchment than I was with sword and bow. But I'm ready to help however I can.
{{55049764-22-15778:}}That man … I see it, too. His connection to the threads of fate is tenuous at best. Talk to him, proxy.
{{55049764-15-16178:}}To live a mortal life is to carry a burdensome weight. The Netch understands that better than any of us, I think.\n\nIts methods in making things lighter for your kind are whimsical, to be sure. But its calling is admirable.
{{55049764-5-15793:}}Quickly, turn the flame valves all the way to increase the pressure in the fermentation vats. Meanwhile, I'll deal with Gallio's notes and papers.
{{55049764-5-15790:}}You look like you've seen your share of battle. That's great, because the Legion could sure use some competent help right now.
{{55049764-5-15798:}}Something has made Betu terribly ill. I've never seen him so scared. If only I knew what was wrong, I could help him.
{{55049764-1-16339:}}I can't thank you enough for saving me from those Daedra. When they came rushing down the hill, I thought I was a dead man. Then a ballista bolt landed right on top of them. Your targeting was impeccable!
{{55049764-18-16043:}}We reset the traps and burned the ropes. That should slow the assault like Commander Merian planned. He wants us to meet him in the main courtyard. Let's get going.
{{55049764-14-16178:}}The Dragon and I have spoken the most since Ulfsild took her leave. She thinks me pompous, talks in riddles, but it is time well spent, I think.\n\nYou have the strength to find the worth in her whorls of logic and thought, adventurer.
{{55049764-6-16054:}}The ritual still hangs heavy around this place. That's why there are so many sodding bugs.\n\nThe seedpod we need should be close by. Let's go find one!
{{55049764-6-16051:}}I gave you an order, mercenary. Get to it!\n\nGrab that oil that's behind you first. I'll walk you through everything else.
{{55049764-0-15768:}}I wonder what's to become of this dowry. I could save it for my next bride. Or perhaps I could invest it in some sort of capital venture. Father rarely loosens the purse strings for my ideas, so this is the perfect time to prove myself.
{{55049764-0-15769:}}Tribune Alea Idolus, at your service.
{{55049764-17-16248:}}Already missing my fabulous tendrils? No wonder. Few who gaze upon it can resist my splendor for long. Float easy, and know I will always be here if you need me.
{{55049764-16-16170:}}The Indrik has given you a series of challenges? Excellent. Things are proceeding apace. Do your best to fulfill his wishes. \n\nGaining the Indrik's favor may help you connect to the other Luminaries.
{{55049764-16-16178:}}You have restored the altar. May you stride forward with an understanding of the power you wield.\n\nYour magic will leave marks on this world. Whether they be scars or fingerprints remains to be seen.
{{55049764-25-16021:}}I know something is wrong, but I do not have the words to express what that may be.
{{55049764-10-15985:}}I'll stick with you, comrade. We need to locate Nantharion before he reaches that well. I just hope Beragon can find us again.
{{55049764-11-16248:}}I'm supposed to test you. But tests are weighty, not good for floating. I prefer games. Easier to win and just as easy to prove how clever you are. \n\nListen to me, droning on like the Dragon! Anyway, I have some games for us to play.
{{55049764-5-15802:}}Not now, proxy. I want to observe this exchange.
{{55049764-5-15800:}}No blood. A broken window. And a fractured statue with no explanation as to how it was damaged. Mizzik feels that there is something just out of reach of this one's claws, but what could it be?
{{55049764-5-15806:}}Not now, friend of the Bogvir who isn't. I have more important matters to consider than whatever it is that interests you.
{{55049764-4-15998:}}As Hermaeus Mora feared, the Prince of Paths threatens the pillars of causality upon which reality stands. Yet Beragon's plan offers a glimmer of hope. A single thread of fate, spreading out from this moment.\n\nSee what the Skein reveals, proxy.
{{55049764-4-15991:}}Something funny is going on. Nantharion told us to come find him in Hoperoot if we learned anything about the wildburn seed, but the sentries at the gate refused to let us in!\n\nTribune Alea and I had to back off before it came to blows.
{{55049764-4-15993:}}I sense the necromantic corruption is weakening, but we must not stop now. The ruins have not been fully exorcised yet.
{{55049764-7-16015:}}Pardon, but I'm a bit busy transcribing notes for my employer, Narsis Dren. He has much to say about the old Ayleid ruins of Wendir.
{{55049764-3-16250:}}You're a friend of Nahlia's? Are you with the Mages Guild, too?\n\nThey've been overworking her for far too long. If you can't help Elic's father, maybe you could help with that.
{{55049764-3-16251:}}It was here at Borderwatch that I was given command so many years ago. I sent for my son, urging him to enlist. We would defend these walls together.\n\nAnd he arrived, only to hand in his blade.
{{55049764-3-16254:}}The Netch and the Dragon may be more outspoken. The Indrik more powerful. But I believe the Gryphon and the Fox were part of the Scholarium's heart. \n\nGood to see that heart beating again.
{{55049764-3-16255:}}A fascinating creature, the Gryphon. The more I read, the more I hear from the Fox, the more it seems almost … sad. \n\nLike a character from the pages of the fables themselves.
{{55049764-3-16256:}}Welcome, traveler. I'm Calantius, Count of Skingrad, Lord of West Weald, and so on, and so on.\n\nI hope you have time to enjoy all that our fair city and the surrounding countryside have to offer!
{{55049764-3-16257:}}Let's discuss what you've found.
{{55049764-9-16286:}}This is amazing. The Labyrinthian, the real one anyway, was built by Shalidor to test potential archmages.\n\nAnd now here we are. Hah!
{{55049764-4-16051:}}I don't care how those Daedra got in. I need them gone before they dismantle the rest of the barricade.
{{55049764-4-16055:}}Let's get back. And hopefully, this won't make our fathers any angrier than they already are.
{{55049764-4-16054:}}Let's hurry. If the village is waiting … well. Damn it, now I'm nervous!
{{55049764-4-16056:}}The ruin with their little grotto is on the southern edge of town. You go talk to them, I'll find my brother and Minth.\n\nYou're getting the easy job here, I think.
{{55049764-4-16058:}}That Ciiril is a talented brewer. Hmph. Even still, the marriage will not go forward. And you can tell her I said so.\n\nNow, where is my son …?
{{55049764-24-15802:}}The Whispered Path. I have come across vague references to such a place in my studies, but I never imagined I would walk its secret corridors. Let us see where it leads.
{{55049764-14-16170:}}The echo at the base of the altar is just one of many. Much of the Scholarium's knowledge has been lost to time.\n\nBut, if Magnus wills it, Ulfsild's preparations should be enough to see us through.
{{55049764-3-16111:}}I think I know where we are. This road matches this squiggly line.
{{55049764-3-16118:}}All the relics are secured and activated. Hopefully this puts this business behind us, comrade. Let's head back to Beragon's townhouse.
{{55049764-24-16021:}}I don't understand what's happening. All of it. Occurring simultaneously. It won't stop.
{{55049764-6-16057:}}Green keep you, traveler. I hope you enjoy everything our village has to offer.
{{55049764-3-15800:}}It seems once again Betu wants us to traipse around the estate grounds. Be sure to pocket that key. It may prove to be useful.
{{55049764-3-15802:}}It appears we have done it, proxy. Ithelia is no longer a threat to our reality. Your solution was not what I expected, and even Hermaeus Mora was surprised. But I suppose that was why he selected you as fate's chosen in the first place.
{{55049764-3-15806:}}I believe you and I have spoken enough. Tell Fennorian what you discovered and make sure he deals with my husband.\n\nRemind him that he owes me.
{{55049764-9-16255:}}Ulfsild must have left it behind with the annotations already visible. For some reason? Maybe if you meet that fox you can ask him about it.\n\nI put it on the table just over there. Give it a look.
{{55049764-2-16035:}}Hurry! Untie my bonds before they notice you!
{{55049764-2-16039:}}Deputy, I have a message for you from Constable Yabren.
{{55049764-3-15847:}}No sign of reinforcements yet. I hope Calvo can hold out a bit longer.
{{55049764-14-16247:}}Normally, I'd be more wary of something as powerful as a Luminary playing tricks. But the Netch's sense of humor seems harmless.
{{55049764-22-15800:}}We have everything Otho needs to save Betu, let's hurry back.
{{55049764-22-15802:}}Be wary, proxy. The One Who Knows got us close, but as we saw at the Loom, the energy now contained in Ithelia makes portals behave strangely. We still need to reach Mora's private sanctum.
{{55049764-7-15840:}}Reproducing a Sage's Dream sounds like a fun challenge. It'll certainly take my mind off of what's happening to my inn.\n\nYou'll find stairs to the cellar in the room behind you. It opens up into an old ruin, but don't mind that.
{{55049764-9-16051:}}Stendarr's blood, it's good to see you. We need all the swords we can get. And anyone traveling with Tribune Alea is always welcome in a fight.\n\nThose Daedra are pummeling us. I need something done to hold them back.
{{55049764-16-15971:}}Looks like we've got multiple options for getting inside. From what I recall, we'll find the stairs to the buried halls in the middle of the stockade. Assuming the Recollection hasn't blocked them up, that is.
{{55049764-16-15973:}}I've had my share of strange adventures, but helping you battle Daedra and save all of existence? That's beyond even the stories my little sister Eveli enjoys so much. Wait until I tell her all about it!
{{55049764-8-15779:}}I've been doing my best to keep morale up while you were gone, but even my usually cheerful mood is under assault. More and more of those tears in reality keep appearing. We're running out of time!\n\nDid you learn anything useful at the Loom?
{{55049764-8-15778:}}I see you and our allies have returned safely with a fragment of the Mirrormoor titan … but where is Curate Gadayn?
{{55049764-1-16051:}}As safe as can be expected. We are a military installation, after all. We'll wipe out the remaining Daedra, then begin rebuilding the keep.\n\nI expect Tribune Alea will want a final word or two with you before you go.
{{55049764-5-16039:}}If you're here to gamble, you're early. The tables don't get going until later. If you want a drink, head into the tavern.
{{55049764-1-16054:}}Damn. I honestly don't remember the last time I felt this good. I'm already planning details in my head. This will be so much fun!
{{55049764-1-16055:}}She's already making plans, I can tell. I just hope we can enjoy the moment.
{{55049764-1-16056:}}I'm so proud of those two. Thank you, traveler.
{{55049764-1-16057:}}My daughter, marrying Minth's son. I've been fighting this for so long, like trying to deal with pests in a grove. \n\nPerhaps it's time I thought about this a different way.
{{55049764-1-16058:}}When the day started, I had no idea it would end like this. My son, marrying Nedolir's daughter. The Dawnway and the Green Pact … ancestors give me strength.
{{55049764-1-16059:}}This camp is lost and my companions are dead. Wildburn will cover any trace of their existence. And the evidence of the Recollection's crimes.
{{55049764-5-16035:}}I'm interested in what you found and you can tell me on the way. I want to check out Zeggar's Blind. I heard more than one of the hired mercenaries mention the name as I made my way to find you.\n\nIt's just to the northeast of the town.
{{55049764-1-15778:}}Gather the relics, proxy. Then I shall open a portal to the realm of the One Who Knows.
{{55049764-1-15779:}}I may have more appendages than you, but I'm not a pack bearer. Leramil specifically told you to take the relics, so get to it!
{{55049764-1-15770:}}A proper introduction, then. I am Amaurel Verdulis, Grander's bride to be. You can tell him it was me. I'm certain my betrayal will make for quite the waterworks. I harbor no ill will toward the man, only what he represents. This contract.
{{55049764-1-15772:}}Selling just a few bottles of Blue Aedral goes a long way to keeping our winery open and our workers employed. Speaking of … can I have the wine you recovered?
{{55049764-1-15774:}}Found that valuable wine, eh? All of it? I mean, I hope you found all of it.
{{55049764-9-16118:}}Once more into the breach, eh comrade? I still can't quite wrap my head around the end of reality, but if our actions will spare us from that fate, you can count on me.
{{55049764-1-16317:}}The Loom, I see the threads all around it. It consists of portals within portals, all connected to the Many Paths. You can destroy it with Abolisher, proxy!
{{55049764-1-16316:}}What are you waiting for? Use Abolisher to destroy the Loom!
{{55049764-1-16315:}}This is our chance! Use Abolisher to destroy the Loom before Ithelia weaves us all out of existence!
{{55049764-1-16313:}}Found this axe in a crate. If Xoryn comes back, I'll be ready.
{{55049764-1-16312:}}I need to keep busy. To keep my mind off… this.
{{55049764-1-16311:}}I should have seen that Dremora before the fight broke out. And instead of helping, I'm resting with the wounded. \n\nI'm sure my wounds hurt worse than my battered pride, but it's a close call.
{{55049764-1-16310:}}I'm getting Keshargo's personal attention, he must be worried about me. \n\nI don't remember what happened after that Dremora showed up. It feels like he won the fight though.
{{55049764-1-16319:}}And all this time it was a children's book that would guide my way. There is one more location I must go to meditate on.\n\nThe riddle is so close. I just need a little more time.
{{55049764-0-16305:}}Mortal! There's precious little time. The fabric of reality continues to shred and tear due to Ithelia's very presence!\n\nLeramil sent me to bring you back at once.
{{55049764-0-16304:}}Look for Tribune Alea inside the walls of the estate, in the courtyard.\n\nKnow that the tribune can be somewhat demanding, but she's a fine officer. And I'm sure she'll pay you for any aid you provide. The Legion hires mercenaries all the time.
{{55049764-0-16307:}}I made this lens so you might see the world as I do. The very warp and weft of magic laid out before me.
{{55049764-0-16301:}}I still can't believe I'm back. I thought I'd be trapped as a pig forever!\n\nAt least your friend made good on her promise, but I'm not sure what to think of her. I don't know if I'll ever be able to eat pork again after this.
{{55049764-0-16300:}}You're here for my mother, I take it? Deal with your business quickly, and keep me and my daughter out of it.
{{55049764-0-16303:}}The Recollection will not be deterred. This land is ours by right and by blood. It will be ours, mark my word.
{{55049764-0-16302:}}I should have been in there with her … stubborn soldier. But brave. \n\nAnyway, you've done more than your share. The Legion will take it from here.
{{55049764-0-16309:}}Pirsisa saw you complete our task. She must thank you on behalf of all her fallen friends. They'd be happier knowing this expedition wasn't in vain.
{{55049764-17-15802:}}One more obstacle to bar our path. Hopefully the Lamp of Clarity shall show us the way, as it has done previously.
{{55049764-5-16170:}}Did you have questions for me?
{{55049764-6-16219:}}Please be gentle here in the Wilderhall, traveler. Some of these documents are hundreds and hundreds of years old.
{{55049764-6-16217:}}You there! I'm a captain in the West Weald Legion and I require your assistance.
{{55049764-6-16210:}}This one has never experienced anything like that before. The weightlessness. The feeling of freedom! It was not unlike stepping though a portal, but prolonged. \n\nThe citadel is filled with many secrets.
{{55049764-19-16017:}}I suppose we should not be surprised that the Loom would harbor memories relating to Ithelia. Let us take a moment to observe this one.
{{55049764-3-16192:}}Ow. I'm normally so good at conversations, but this blasted trap on my leg is really getting in the way. \n\nWould you mind releasing it? I don't think I'll be able to form any more cohesive thoughts with it on like this.
{{55049764-0-16111:}}I am full to the brim with ideas! I am going to be pondering these concepts all the way back to Evermore.
{{55049764-0-16112:}}Hello again, friend! Good of you to chat with us. Have you come to speak to us about the Molag Bal Paradox again?
{{55049764-0-16118:}}Comrade! Don't suppose you decided to enlist? The Legion could use you! No? I understand. Still, I'm glad you decided to stop by.\n\nYou're lucky you caught me. As usual, the count has me running hither and yon. Sometimes I barely have time to eat.
{{55049764-19-15971:}}The ruins of Niryastare lie in the far western reaches of the Colovian Highlands. I'll secure a few things here, then meet you there.
{{55049764-24-15778:}}I, too, am at a loss as to what possible use the depleted relics may serve. Still, if the One Who Knows suggests you shall have need of them, then we should take them with us.
{{55049764-6-16205:}}Breaking down doors was easier twenty years ago. Go on, friend. It's up to you and Hooke now!
{{55049764-6-15971:}}Just think of it. No one's opened this vault in thousands of years! Place the lesser welkynd stones in their sockets, and we'll see what the Ayleids of Niryastare were so anxious to protect.
{{55049764-15-16205:}}You were right to convince me to move on from my ring. Too often do we shackle ourselves to physical things for reasons beyond the value they offer us.
{{55049764-14-15779:}}Do you know what that mortal just described? A tear in reality! If that's the instability I sensed, then no wonder my tentacles are quivering!\n\nI suppose we need to go into that cave and take a look. You first.
{{55049764-14-15778:}}Use the Echonir, proxy. If any recent memories of Ithelia remain, they may tell us where she and Torvesard have gone.
{{55049764-15-15793:}}I provided Ursilia with a common antidote for most poisons. Not sure it will do anything about the wine, but it shouldn't hurt.\n\nWatch out for the vampires Gallio mentioned in his journal as we make our way to his alchemical laboratory.
{{55049764-6-15798:}}I was outside searching for Betu when I heard Aquilia scream. By the time I got here, the killer was gone.
{{55049764-7-15993:}}I hope you're prepared for what lies ahead, traveler. The undead are not to be trifled with. Give me a moment to cremate this corpse. She may have been a necromancer, but everyone deserves a proper sendoff.
{{55049764-1-15806:}}I assume that explosion that rocked the vineyard was your doing? You and Fennorian, I suppose. I'll take it that you accomplished what I asked? \n\nNever mind. Speak to Fennorian. I have a business to set right.
{{55049764-1-15807:}}You there! I am bored and my hounds are hungry.\n\nWill the auction start soon? Or must we continue this Colovian dance of manners and pleasantries while my gold sits unspent?
{{55049764-1-15804:}}No invitation, no admittance.
{{55049764-1-15802:}}The plan Scruut has brought us sounds tenuous, but we must put our faith in the One Who Knows. \n\nEven with Ithelia gone, the tears ripped in the fabric of reality shall continue to spread. Like pulling on a loose thread until your tunic unravels.
{{55049764-1-15800:}}Mizzik's snout wrinkles at the stench of both fresh and old death. Betu led us to the memorial of the lost Uriel Weatherleah and now we find the cook, freshly poisoned. Let this one see the confession letter.
{{55049764-1-15801:}}Do you feel it? Like thousands of aggravating daedmites crawling across my tentacles. There's definitely something not right here in Apocrypha.\n\nHurry up and use the Skein!
{{55049764-1-15808:}}I'd offer you a glass, but your friend just took the last one! I wasn't expecting that. None of the other guests I've served this evening even tried it. Only their attendants and servants.
{{55049764-1-15809:}}Ah, welcome. I'm Lord Gallio Valente, the humble proprietor of Valente Vineyards and Winery.\n\nYou, however, have me at a disadvantage. I do not believe we've met. Which of my acquaintances decided to bring you along as their guest today?
{{55049764-0-16204:}}I believe each of us has been hurting in our own way for years now. But coming back together, even in these circumstances … it's helped us. Well, least it helped me.
{{55049764-0-16205:}}I used to believe the Eight had a hand in everything that's happened since that fateful day at Caelum Vineyard. Like it was our punishment for all we had done. Maybe it was, but we all have a choice.\n\nAnd I believe mine is now clear.
{{55049764-0-16200:}}We're so close to getting out of here, but I'm not sure we're going to make it.\n\nI don't think we're the last ones left alive, though. Oh gods! I hope we're not the last ones.
{{55049764-0-16203:}}Be on your guard down there, mercenary. In addition to the Recollection forces, there were Daedra with Nantharion—as well as a strange woman wearing a hooded cloak!
{{55049764-5-15975:}}I may never get used to fighting Daedra and magic-users, but at least we put an end to Nantharion and his plot to destroy West Weald. That should finish the Recollection.\n\nNow is it too much to hope that Ithelia will take her power and just go away?
{{55049764-5-15972:}}I don't like the way your fellow mortals stare at me. You'd think they've never seen an emissary of the Great Eye before. So help me, the next one who squeaks in terror will get something that really scares them!\n\nTalk to Beragon. He asked first.
{{55049764-5-15973:}}Don't forget, Scruut wanted to talk to you. And take your time and mingle with the other guests. They're all here because of you!
{{55049764-5-15971:}}We did it! The great welkynd stone unlocked the vault. Let's get going, friend. Now that the door's open, there's nothing to stop the Recollection from following us inside.
{{55049764-3-16180:}}Hate to bring bad news to the tribune, but I'm the only member of the cohort left. Those Recollection zealots killed legionaries guarding the estate until we sent whoever remained down here.\n\nThat's when we walked right into the Daedra's clutches.
{{55049764-3-16182:}}You've nearly restored that altar, haven't you? I'm impressed.\n\nWe ought to get things cleaned up around here before more of the guild comes in.
{{55049764-3-16183:}}If we let more of the guild down here, I could catalog and analyze the tomes in earnest. My true passion! Instead of setting wards or cleaning cobwebs all day.\n\nI know that's not something you'll make a decision about. I just wanted to complain.
{{55049764-12-16255:}}I'm here whenever you need me. Just let me know how I can help.
{{55049764-0-15859:}}I confess, Daedric incursions and wandering Princes are a little outside my typical experience. Perhaps Leramil can make sense of what's going on around here.
{{55049764-0-15850:}}This investigation is terribly stressful. I need some time alone to think.
{{55049764-0-15851:}}Surely you can stop running about and relax. The killer has confessed to his crimes. Too bad we cannot ask him why he did it, but who can understand the mind of a murderer anyway?
{{55049764-0-15852:}}Another murder? I fear any one of us is at risk. Better not wander off alone.
{{55049764-0-15854:}}Speak with the Prince of Fate, mortal. We do not have much time before my power returns and the madness overtakes me again.
{{55049764-0-15855:}}Leftwheal is a long way from returning to its former trading glory, but we'll get there. We may look defeated, but I know these people. This is our home. Once our wounds have healed, we'll strike back with a vengeance.
{{55049764-0-15856:}}I know little about Bosmer mystical traditions. If Beragon knows a greenspeaker who can be of use, you should seek them out. Find out what you can about the wildburn seed.\n\nI have my own avenues of investigation to follow.
{{55049764-0-15857:}}The communique says we need to keep ringing the proper sequence at set intervals until we receive a response or help arrives.\n\nThat responsibility falls to me now. I'll bar the door once you're gone.
{{55049764-10-16051:}}Feldagard Keep must not fall to these invaders. We must protect it at all costs!
{{55049764-10-16055:}}Hey there, traveler. You've found us at an awkward time. \n\nYou'd better talk to Laeni. She can explain better than me.
{{55049764-10-16054:}}Root rot and ruin, of all the days. I'm sorry you had to see that, traveler. Our family drama is a poor welcome to Vashabar. \n\nThose two old timber pigs were our fathers. My beloved Clendagal and I simply can't get them to see reason.
{{55049764-10-16056:}}Welcome, traveler! This is the Vashabar Garden of Ale. I'm the owner and host, Ciiril.\n\nDid I hear raised voices just now? Was that Laeni and her father?
{{55049764-3-16112:}}It doesn't matter if he figures out the way. Discussing the Paradox will distract us until we're lost again. I'm afraid we're like that.
{{55049764-18-15960:}}Doesn't look good. Something killed these bloodfiends, but at least I don't see Grivier or Tham lying among the dead.\n\nSee if that piece of paper contains anything interesting.
{{55049764-8-16248:}}You are most impressive, Not-Ulfsild. I will ensure the mortals I have in mind are aided by your buoyant deeds. \n\nIn the meantime, let us talk about your proper trial. And another mortal all together.
{{55049764-8-16242:}}Mortal, it's been some time since I had the pleasure of real conversation. I may have begun this relationship on the wrong wing. What do you say we begin again?\n\nI am the Dragon. A being of purest magic, intellectual, and enjoyer of riddles.
{{55049764-8-16247:}}How do you talk to a Luminary? Should I be formal? Or tell it a joke? \n\nThe Votary Commander's training didn't prepare me for magical Netches.
{{55049764-1-16156:}}I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure if I should even be here … but I wanted to show my support for everything you did for Maerenah. And me. And, apparently, all of West Weald!\n\nWe're a long way from Sutch, eh?
{{55049764-1-16151:}}The rot has been culled from Vashabar thanks to you. I only hope that Nantharion's mad plan was due to the influence of this forgotten Daedric Prince, Ithelia, and not the philosophy of the Dawnway.\n\nVashabar has enough problems remaining as it is.
{{55049764-1-16150:}}I offered Beragon the use of my more … spacious accommodations for the celebration, but he felt more comfortable hosting it himself. I suppose he prefers this quaint setting to a ballroom.\n\nNo matter. Ithelia is thwarted and West Weald is safe.
{{55049764-1-16153:}}Hello, walker. One needs not be as perceptive as Mizzik Thunderboots to see all the good you have done for West Weald. \n\nBut this one is curious about the Recollection … the group's origins sound like a mystery Mizzik should pursue next.
{{55049764-22-15983:}}I don't know if it's a good idea to take that seed to Vashabar. We could be handing it right back to the Recollection. Who knows how many friends they have there?
{{55049764-19-15960:}}Not sure if the fabric got caught on something or if it was lost in a struggle. Either way, I think we're getting close. Let's keep moving.
{{55049764-2-16178:}}With the sigil in hand, you need merely return to the altar. You will see, you will feel its power unfold. And know that you have taken another step on the path of Scribing.
{{55049764-2-16170:}}I can sense the power of the Indrik within you. You are one step closer to unlocking the potential of the Scribing altar.
{{55049764-2-16171:}}So many deaths here in Ontus. So much illness. And did you hear about the Wood Elf cultists? Their leader is a king of some sort!
{{55049764-2-16172:}}A passing traveler says the Wood Elves in the new forest are evil. That their king leads a violent cult that seeks to turn the entire Weald into jungle.\n\nIf this is true, I'm ashamed to call myself Bosmer.
{{55049764-7-16055:}}There are mosaics aplenty in the old ruins marked on your map. I'll meet you near the entrance. And … thank you again, traveler. I still can't believe we have this chance.
{{55049764-18-16266:}}Go on, last page. You're almost there!
{{55049764-1-15781:}}Oh good! I was starting to worry those necromancers got the better of you. Or that you fell in with their ranks! Hah. Just kidding. Who would be tempted to fall in with a group like that? Ridiculous.\n\nDid you happen to retrieve those shards?
{{55049764-1-15780:}}By the looks of it, you gave Orissa bad news. This one will mind his own business, but perhaps you should talk to her.
{{55049764-0-16190:}}Haldain bought us enough time to run away from that awful creature.\n\nI twisted my ankle on a root, but I think I'll be able to walk on it soon.
{{55049764-0-16191:}}I'm a bit busy here. \n\nHaldain asked us to leave, but I won't desert anyone else still in the lumber camp.
{{55049764-0-16192:}}I'm surprised that hunter can walk bearing the weight of his own self-importance. \n\nPromise me that you'll stop him.
{{55049764-6-15840:}}Don't know what you did, but the woman by the fire finally left. Sure, she just followed you downstairs for some unknown reason, but that's progress.\n\nStill seeing the strange stuff, though. Bring back some sugar so we can make her that drink.
{{55049764-8-16005:}}Delving into old ruins feels so familiar. Sure, I hung up my adventuring gear long ago, but you never forget the basics.\n\nLet's focus on finding Greenspeaker Sorilen and this seed. We can trade stories of our best adventures later.
{{55049764-8-16002:}}The ruins of Ceyond lie to the west of Skingrad. I'll meet you there.
{{55049764-10-15975:}}I don't know what our enemies are planning next for West Weald. But whatever it is, I'll meet it blade in hand. We're not defeated yet.
{{55049764-10-15973:}}Place Abolisher near the tear, friend.
{{55049764-10-15972:}}The nexus point lies inside this cave. As does the reality tear. Come on. The sooner we get this done, the sooner I can stop worrying about the end of everything.
{{55049764-10-15971:}}Good idea, friend! The Lamp and Abolisher give us an advantage previous explorers didn't have.\n\nI suggest we start with the east passage and look for a way up to the north. The Recollection mage's notes suggest we might find something there.
{{55049764-14-16014:}}Ah, my old assistant! An unexpected occurrence, but a welcome one. I need some help exploring the nearby ruins of Wendir. You may not think yourself capable of such a task, but worry not, for I'll be with you every step of the way.
{{55049764-11-16206:}}Feh. Of course Naku is working a mine. Probably the only cat in Tamriel who doesn't fuss over being sleek and clean.\n\nDon't tell him I said that.
{{55049764-11-15778:}}This portal shall take us to Beragon's townhouse. We should depart immediately, proxy.
{{55049764-1-16292:}}You've done us a great service helping more civilians escape the chaos. I'll admit that my bow is of little use against smog and flames.
{{55049764-1-16293:}}Hold on a moment, I'm just catching my breath. I've healed more wounds today than I have all year.
{{55049764-1-16291:}}Speak with the baroness, I'm still trying to recover from my wounds and our little conversations are tiring.
{{55049764-1-16294:}}Is it safe inside yet? No? I cannot rest until I know my family is out safe.
{{55049764-16-16248:}}I would never tell you to stay away from my beauty, Not-Ulfsild. Bask in it. Be humbled.\n\nBut if the Crow's wing is unlocked, waiting for you … perhaps the basking can wait.
{{55049764-16-16242:}}My advice, mortal, is not to jump to action. Careful thought is in precious short supply in the world.\n\nTake a seat, or a perch. And see if a solution does not present itself.
{{55049764-16-16247:}}Nable of the Fetch! Hah! That got me.
{{55049764-3-15772:}}Truly a tireless companion, I'm so happy we found him safe and sound. Though, I suspect, if anyone did try to hurt him, they're likely tending to a nasty bite wound as we speak.\n\nLazen should be able to lead us to the rest of my missing wine.
{{55049764-3-15774:}}Do I look like I'm in a talking mood? Leave me to tend to my wounds.
{{55049764-3-15778:}}Despite the loss of Curate Gadayn, you recovered a fragment filled with the essence of Mirrormoor and we successfully created a new relic—the Mirror of Truth.\n\nA time to mourn shall come later, provided we stop Ithelia and reality survives.
{{55049764-3-15779:}}The Mirror of Truth? As good a name as any, I suppose.\n\nWith this relic, maybe we can convince Ithelia to abandon her plan. Maybe.
{{55049764-4-16316:}}It's not my choice of battlefield, but we have to make our stand somewhere. The Shardborn must be stopped.
{{55049764-4-16315:}}It's a strange road, friend, but I'm with you all the way to the end of it. Let's finish what we came here to do.
{{55049764-17-16206:}}If you part with your coin for me, I'll follow you anywhere. But the swill they serve here isn't worth a sacrifice like that. A Scarlet would find the ledger in Laurina's house and trim its leaves. No record—no debt. Simple.
{{55049764-12-16005:}}Sorilen said she'd meet us here, but I don't see her. And that dead body, I'd recognize that gear anywhere. They're part of the Recollection.\n\nExamine the note next to the body. Maybe we'll learn what's going on here.
{{55049764-24-15782:}}The hero of Feldagard! Great timing. Seems you have a knack for showing up when I need assistance.\n\nLook around. No people. Strange, right? I detached an entire Legion cohort to guard this estate, but no one's here. Where could they all be?
{{55049764-9-15798:}}It's remarkable seeing the famous Mizzik Thunderboots at work. He's already noticed more than I ever could have. If only the situation weren't so grim.
{{55049764-9-15797:}}Mizzik hopes news of this case strikes fear in the heart of all criminals who think they have gotten away with their crimes. No matter how many years go by, justice is still hunting. And Mizzik will find you in the end.
{{55049764-0-16011:}}That didn't take long. Now we've got little Daedra popping in with warnings of impending doom?\n\nI told you we had unfinished business.
{{55049764-0-16010:}}Activating the mirrors in the proper order awakened the portal. I suspect we will find Ithelia and Vargas somewhere on the other side, at the Loom of the Untraveled Road. How it will restore what was lost, though, remains obscure.\n\nAfter you, proxy.
{{55049764-0-16013:}}The wildburn seed grows deep in the ruins. I suggest we split up. I'll lead the Recollection on a merry chase while you and Beragon find the seed. And don't worry, I'm sure we'll meet up along the way.\n\nAnd, Beragon, remember your history.
{{55049764-0-16015:}}I need to take my leave shortly. Narsis should turn up any time now. Perhaps I should go looking for him. In any event, thank you for your help.
{{55049764-0-16014:}}Now, assistant! We have found the Emblem of the Last King! It's been waiting so long for me to recover it!
{{55049764-0-16017:}}We should not linger here. The destruction of the Loom has created new instabilities along the Many Paths. Until they subside, the area around the Loom is dangerous. I do not wish to be lost again in the Many Paths.\n\nUse the portal I opened, proxy.
{{55049764-0-16019:}}What is that thing? It's got so many eyes!\n\nNever mind, it wants to talk to you. Go find out what it means by we're all doomed.
{{55049764-14-16043:}}More Daedra, emerging from the north door. That leads to the barracks beneath the keep. How did they get in there?\n\nNo matter. Let's go deal with this, comrade.
{{55049764-15-16002:}}The friendly Daedra, Scruut, sent me to meet you, comrade. She and Leramil told me some strange things, but after everything that happened in West Weald …. \n\nAnyway, I'm here to help.
{{55049764-1-16341:}}Gods, my leg hurts. Beragon carried me here, but some of my family is still in there. Please, find them.
{{55049764-7-16276:}}Ulfsild wanted a legacy, and now I'm to be the Scholarium's librarian? What would she say to that? \n\nShe had to give up everything that mattered to her. Would she want me to do this?
{{55049764-10-16205:}}Hooke found these notes with the other Scarlets who were killed. They were penned by the killer to lure out our old comrades.\n\nSpeaking of which, I don't see Naku. Hooke's waiting to hear what you found, friend.
{{55049764-16-16005:}}I don't hear any more calls for help. We helped everyone we could. That'll have to be enough.\n\nLet's keep looking for Greenspeaker Sorilen. I need to know if she survived the disaster.
{{55049764-16-16002:}}The Lamp of Clarity's energy has been restored. I'll see you back at Beragon's townhouse.
{{55049764-29-15800:}}It seems Betu has more to show us. Let's follow him deeper into the tunnels.
{{55049764-3-16013:}}I had no idea the ground would shake so violently when I asked Beragon to meet me here. Nature is nothing if not unpredictable.\n\nI also didn't expect him to bring a guest. So, who are you, friend of Beragon?
{{55049764-3-16010:}}I almost feel sorry for Ithelia's scions. To exist for millennia, tormented by the sense they were missing something and could not find their purpose.\n\nThe Loom of the Untraveled Road. That must be the loom Ithelia spoke of in Miscarcand.
{{55049764-3-16011:}}We shared some strange adventures. I never imagined I'd find myself wandering a forgotten plane of Oblivion. Or erased from reality, for that matter. But we finally beat Vargas and her Shardborn.\n\nI'd fight by your side any time, comrade.
{{55049764-3-16014:}}Aren't you glad you joined this endeavor? Clearly, Wendir has its secrets. Fascinating! This looks like another puzzle. I'm sure I can be of help here, but go on, take a look.
{{55049764-3-16015:}}Have you found him? It would set my heart at ease to know he's safe. My dear Narsis is too kind, trusting the Recollection. For all I know, they may have locked him in a sarcophagus or something.
{{55049764-4-16293:}}Are you in need of healing? I'm stretched a little thin, but I can mend your wounds if need be.
{{55049764-4-16292:}}Stay sharp. The monsters may be contained in Leftwheal, but there's nothing stopping them from breaching the outer walls.
{{55049764-4-16291:}}Ack, leave me be. There are others who could use your help.
{{55049764-4-16294:}}My cubs, please, I don't know if they made it out.
{{55049764-2-15793:}}That was excellent work, friend. We destroyed Lord Gallio's laboratory and managed to rescue the workers he experimented on.\n\nThere might be some ramifications over any remaining Vesper Valente, but it won't become the sweeping problem I feared.
{{55049764-2-15792:}}If you're on of those Recollection bastards, you have a lot to answer for. Tell me why we shouldn't just run you through, Wood Elf.
{{55049764-2-15795:}}This is no place to wander aimlessly, traveler. The foul beasts are vicious and hungry for blood!
{{55049764-2-15797:}}Be wary. That man is Edric, the estate's cook, and he seems on edge. One should always worry when the help looks nervous.
{{55049764-2-15796:}}Oh, uh, I'm all right. My knees just don't seem to want to work. There's so much to do. I have to tell our parents. \n\nOh gods, I have to tell our parents.
{{55049764-2-15799:}}I could use your help planning our debut. If you're willing, of course!
{{55049764-2-15798:}}Where is Betu going off to now?
{{55049764-17-16205:}}Akatosh take me, but I grow tired of waiting!\n\nHmm. I do not know you. Is there something you need, stranger? I can't talk long, or else the thief hiding in that ruin might give me the slip.
{{55049764-2-15868:}}Ithelia speaks true. Imprisonment is not a permanent solution, as we have so recently experienced. And she is right. I made you fate's chosen for exactly this moment. To provide us with a different perspective.\n\nGo ahead. Speak with Ithelia.
{{55049764-2-15864:}}The Daedric power I sensed earlier is even stronger here. The Daedric shrine is near.
{{55049764-9-15850:}}<<1>>'s death has saddened us all. I do hope we can settle this confusing matter of the will soon. She wouldn't want such stress and confusion lingering over her death.
{{55049764-9-15852:}}It seems I was right to ask for your help. Despite the mysterious contents of the will, this is the most progress we've made all day. I trust you and Mizzik will see things through and we can proceed with this unpleasant business.
{{55049764-13-16183:}}Not the first time Nahlia's gotten herself in over her head. I suppose that's why I'm here. To help keep her head above water.
{{55049764-13-16184:}}With time and patience, we'll learn everything there is to know about the Luminaries, Scribing, and the Scholarium.\n\nAs long as you're with me, friend.
{{55049764-21-15971:}}I'm still deciphering the map from Hoperoot. I can't yet make sense of all the notes, but I figure that any location marked on the map must be important to the Recollection.\n\nHow did your investigations go?
{{55049764-7-16051:}}We thought the barricades would hold longer. Those blasted Daedra broke through when our backs were turned and damaged our last ballista. My legionaries set up another barricade, but it may not last for long.\n\nThat's where you come in, mercenary.
{{55049764-7-16056:}}Gundelion and Malaniel should both be near the center of the village.\n\nDon't be surprised if they find the news about as welcome as a timber pig in the roots cellar.
{{55049764-12-15779:}}What started as instabilities in the threads of fate have become tears in the fabric of reality itself! The Great Eye's worst fears have come to pass! Somehow, someway, Ithelia is responsible for this disaster. I can feel it in my seventh appendage!
{{55049764-12-15778:}}The power Ithelia absorbed when you destroyed the Loom, it has turned her into the very monster Hermaeus Mora foresaw. And now she plans to challenge him and take Apocrypha for herself.\n\nI fear we may not be able to change these spiraling fates.
{{55049764-14-15785:}}That wasn't so difficult. When you see Leramil again, tell her that I asked about her. I mean, if she brings it up.
{{55049764-14-16130:}}Now that we have a moment, allow me to introduce myself. Nahlia, Votary knight in the Order of the Lamp. Pleasure to make your acquaintance, adept.\n\nIrnard briefed you on our situation?
{{55049764-3-16222:}}I admit, this is all above my head. What do I know about magical disasters, Daedric invasions, or secret conspiracies? Give me problems I can solve with a sharp sword and I'd be much happier!
{{55049764-0-16268:}}The drinks here are good, but the people are better. And you're especially to my liking.
{{55049764-0-16269:}}The Archmage was a champion of justice. A gentle supporter of the Fox. I cannot express how deep runs my well of respect for this woman.
{{55049764-0-16263:}}I can already feel the pull on Eyevea. Nothing we can do now will outpace the greed of a Daedric Prince.\n\nI know that this situation is hard to accept, but I wish the Gryphon and the Fox would understand. This isn't a fight we can win.
{{55049764-0-16266:}}The Gryphon and Nahlia are so much alike! It's like the Gryphon's a knight. Or Nahlia is a gryphon. \n\nWait. Is Nahlia a gryphon?
{{55049764-0-16264:}}I suppose I ought to thank you. Count yourself lucky, darling. I've never let anyone see as much of myself as you have.\n\nI don't know what's coming next, but at least I know I'll be facing it whole. You have my gratitude.
{{55049764-0-16265:}}The flowers by the river's edge are so pretty. Maybe my tears could help water them. Oh, but they're so far away.
{{55049764-13-15971:}}I didn't come this way before. We'd better be careful here, friend. I have to imagine the Recollection knows about this passage. If they aren't guarding it, something else might be.
{{55049764-6-15786:}}You dispatched that creature? I'm impressed.
{{55049764-10-16266:}}You've done it! I knew you would! I could smell it on you. \n\nAnd grapes, but that might just be what I ate for breakfast.
{{55049764-10-16269:}}The fable … lightly chewed, I see. Oh, Fox.\n\nThe fable will open the path between my domain and the Scholarium. And then we can discuss the future.
{{55049764-14-15802:}}Ithelia had Torvesard place and hide wards to seal the door to the sanctum, proxy. See if the Skein can lead us to these unseen wards.
{{55049764-14-15800:}}Could Otho have assisted in poisoning Lady Weatherleah? He made no mention of serving tea that day. Another thread to pursue in the search for the truth.
{{55049764-17-16017:}}I suspect this structure once housed another portal, but I see nothing here now. Perhaps we should refer to the Skein of Secrets, and see if it indicates the way to Ithelia.
{{55049764-18-15800:}}You've done great work today, traveler. The air is heavy with death, but just like the sun, truth will come out. If only Lady Weatherleah could see Pelena beaten at her own game.
{{55049764-5-16023:}}The journey to Skingrad is usually a calm and restorative one, but nowadays you always have to keep an eye over your shoulder. There are troublemakers lurking under every stone, I assure you.
{{55049764-12-16269:}}Dealing with the Netch, are you? I can tell by the expression on your face. Send it my regards. \n\nBut please do so in a way that does not imply any sort of invitation to my domain.
{{55049764-1-16218:}}Not that I owe you an explanation, but everything I said is true. I wrote it all down. My report to the Legion. I doubt the captain will pass it along, but at least my conscience is clear.\n\nAs for me, tell her I died. Or I'm a deserter. I don't care.
{{55049764-1-16219:}}I suppose we'll have an old fashioned handfast, won't we? A Greenspeaker's wedding. So many traditions to uphold, there.
{{55049764-1-16212:}}If you have any friends, you might want to ask them to join you. I don't know if the expedition is still under attack or what is happening. It could be exceedingly dangerous. \n\nThe portal is there, whenever you're ready.
{{55049764-1-16210:}}The arcane knot is secure and Xoryn won't be able to reconstitute himself for a while. Keshargo will remember how useful it is to have skilled warriors around, especially on important expeditions like this one.
{{55049764-1-16211:}}Right. Now I could explain everything, but you should really speak to Keshargo. He is supposedly in charge of this mess of an expedition.\n\nI hope he sends you after Xoryn. If that battle broke my null arca, I'm going to be upset.
{{55049764-1-16217:}}No matter how many times you lose a squadron, it never gets any easier. \n\nNo need to stick around, mercenary. I'll be ready to head out myself in another few moments. I plan to personally lead the patrol that goes hunting for that traitor, Ulrath.
{{55049764-1-16214:}}We'll fight you if we have to. No damn vampires are going to make a meal out of me or my mother!
{{55049764-27-15793:}}Just as Count Verandis taught me, there is always something to learn if you simply pay attention.\n\nThe field hand was attacked by a death hound, a sure indication of vampiric activity. And he provided a wealth of information, don't you agree?
{{55049764-2-16341:}}I'm pretty sure my leg is broken. Beragon pulled me out from under a rock. He's a good sort, for a Wood Elf. Maybe you can help him.
{{55049764-2-16340:}}I just curled up under a tree for a nap when the quake hit. I slept through most of it until I heard the screaming. That's when Beragon pulled me to my feet. Good thing, too. A huge branch fell right where I had been sleeping just a moment before.
{{55049764-2-16349:}}Feldagard Keep won't fall to these Daedra!
{{55049764-5-16247:}}Don't know about you, but that really took it out of me.\n\nI'll meet you back at the Scholarium, all right? I'll say goodbye to my friends and probably take the long way back. I'm too exhausted to summon another portal right now.
{{55049764-5-16241:}}You're on the path to meet the Dragon. This Luminary was a real challenge for Ulfsild, and might prove the same for you. \n\nJust remember to breath deeply, and stay calm. That's what she told herself, the first time through.
{{55049764-5-16242:}}Your choices, the riddles you sought solutions to, were quite instructive. Gave me an intriguing peek within your mind. Well done.\n\nNow, for a real challenge. If I am to lend my power to the altar you must understand my thoughts as well.
{{55049764-5-16248:}}I look forward to speaking to the Votary, Not-Ulfsild. While I wait, make your way to Suran. Don't worry, she'll follow close behind.
{{55049764-33-15778:}}The Forgotten Prince, no longer forgotten. We must find Prince Ithelia before the fate Hermaeus Mora foresaw comes to pass.
{{55049764-25-15793:}}So, do I look like a Master Bogvir? Probably not, but we work with the tools we're given.\n\nLet's split up and mingle. Talk to servants, guests, whoever's willing to chat.
{{55049764-7-16130:}}I thought smashing the crystal on the altar would fix things. \n\nIn my line of work, hitting things with a sword usually does the trick!
{{55049764-1-16021:}}We walked the Many Paths together and learned much, mortal. Yet, I still cannot control my power or clear the storm from my mind. Every path collides in this place.\n\nIf you have a Sage's Dream, please place it on the table. I wish to calm the chaos.
{{55049764-1-16020:}}Hermaeus Mora chose his proxy correctly. Saving reality from inside a simple inn is an impressive feat.\n\nThe Lamp of Clarity will help us against Ithelia. I would like to bring it to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad to study. May I have it?
{{55049764-1-16023:}}I think Master Grander wishes to speak to you. He's a patient man, but it would be rude to keep him waiting.
{{55049764-4-15797:}}With your aid, Mizzik is confident all questions will be answered! \n\nThe dog is affectionately called Betu and was beloved by the late Lady Weatherleah. This one sees tracks on the ground. Let us crouch down and follow them!
{{55049764-4-15793:}}Burn the rest of the mushroom planters. We need to reduce these strange fungi to ashes!
{{55049764-4-15792:}}I will reclaim Varen's Watch for the Legion. You can count on that.
{{55049764-5-16002:}}Check among the debris of the titan and try to find a good fragment.
{{55049764-5-16005:}}Sorilen joined the Recollection? But they're murderers! This can't be right. I just need to talk to her. Blight and root rot! Maybe she's under a spell or a curse or something.\n\nLet's hurry. We need to get to her and that wildburn seed.
{{55049764-5-16009:}}Shardmarshal Vargas sent us … somewhere. The Fargrave we were exploring faded away. I suddenly found myself in another version of our reality. A mirror world, dark and empty, full of a soul-crushing dread. Like an iron fist around my heart.
{{55049764-4-16211:}}Keshargo's sending you into the citadel? Good. Xoryn doesn't deserve the knot, no matter what he thinks.\n\nJust remember to bring the arcane knot out in one piece. I can't test my null arca without it.
{{55049764-4-16219:}}What's that? Ah, the Rite of Propagation. Only a very small number of copies are left in the world. Do go carefully.
{{55049764-13-16276:}}I'm ready when you are. If past patrols have prepared me, I'd square away what you need to before we head in.
{{55049764-9-16005:}}We're off to face the Recollection again, my friend. Those fanatics seem to be everywhere these days.\n\nWe dealt with them once, so this should be easy, right? Let's head into the ruins and find Greenspeaker Sorilen.
{{55049764-9-16002:}}Stay alert, comrade. There may be more than the Primordial Shattered Titan to deal in these old ruins.
{{55049764-0-16352:}}Not sure I agree with the commander's strategy, but we're still alive. I guess that's something.
{{55049764-0-16353:}}Well, you set my beautiful barricade on fire, but I guess that's part of the plan. I should start finding wood for the next one.
{{55049764-0-16350:}}I don't know if you have Legion training, but that was good work with the ballista. It thinned out the Daedra forces exactly as planned.
{{55049764-0-16351:}}You did it! That ballista crushed those Daedra. I actually feel a little safer now.
{{55049764-12-15802:}}The wards are destroyed. We should return to the door and see if we can access Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum now.
{{55049764-14-16129:}}You stopped! Thank you, adept. I've been asked to find one of our more adventurous members, someone that could lend a situation fresh eyes.\n\nYou look like just the person to help with our predicament.
{{55049764-13-15960:}}I don't know what's worse—Grivier's family learning what he did to save them or never finding out.\n\nAnyway, not our problem. Let's see if we can find something we can use in Rosalyn's alchemy shop. It's east of the stables.
{{55049764-6-16009:}}The way forward is clear. I just hope that portal isn't going to drop us into the middle of a Shardborn war camp or a nest of hungry crystaljacks.\n\nI guess I'm ready when you are, friend.
{{55049764-6-16002:}}Was this Primordial Titan really one of Ithelia's first creations? No matter. Let's destroy it and grab a shard to take back with us.
{{55049764-6-16005:}}These ruins are pretty amazing. If we weren't battling Recollection forces and trying to beat them to the wildburn seed, I'd love to just explore them.\n\nSome people find the weight of history to be crushing. I find it exhilarating!
{{55049764-16-16129:}}If you'll excuse me, I've got Mages Guild business on the mind. I'm sure you're keeping busy, too!
{{55049764-10-16207:}}Thank you for bringing Versidue back. He's my little king, I couldn't imagine life without him!\n\nStill, I'm missing a piece of home. I asked Marcien to trap some guzzards for me, but they haven't returned. I'll reward you if you catch them for me.
{{55049764-14-16242:}}Ulfsild would be proud of you, I think. She and I never truly saw eye to eye. How could we, when she was so much smaller than I am?\n\nDespite that, we held a deep respect for one another. So take the value of my words, or do not. But you've done well.
{{55049764-14-16248:}}So you're chasing the Dragon's favor now, Not-Ulfsild? What a pity you played my games first. You must find the Dragon terribly boring by comparison. Should have saved the best for last!
{{55049764-17-15800:}}Truth be told, this one was ready to write the fortune off. Lady Weatherleah spent so long trying to find her son, Mizzik imagined the fortune dried up. A rare instance where Mizzik is glad to be wrong.
{{55049764-28-15971:}}I can't make sense of it. What do Ithelia and her Shardborn seek to gain here? Why assist the Recollection and allow them to use wildburn seeds to transform West Weald?\n\nWhat are we missing, friend?
{{55049764-5-16125:}}A mortal pathwalker? Such a creature is quite rare. And I see you are accompanied by one of my reflections. An Ithelia from a different path.\n\nYou carry something else with you. It feels like … hatred. Tell me, why have you come to my reality?
{{55049764-1-16189:}}So much as blink wrong, mortal, and I shall end you.
{{55049764-1-16184:}}Hopefully the Dragon will give us a break from riddle-hunting. Not that I wouldn't mind another chance to prove myself! \n\nBut we've got other trees to mind, and her puzzles seem designed to distract.
{{55049764-1-16182:}}I feel quite honored, adventurer. To be present for the restoration of a lost history.\n\nAnd thanks to you and Nahlia, so many more will learn about Ulfsild's legacy.
{{55049764-1-16183:}}I'm not above admitting when I see a good job well done. It's not how I would have done things, but … maybe that's why Nahlia chose you to go through that portal and not me.\n\nGood of you not to gloat about it, either.
{{55049764-1-16180:}}Good, you got out. I worried for a moment that those Recollection bastards caught up with you. Or, worse, those horrid Daedra.\n\nYou should talk to Tribune Alea. Losing all those people weighs on her. I know the feeling.
{{55049764-6-16247:}}We should hurry. I don't know how much time the ink will buy us before Jahones passes. The first piece of his soul is on the other side of that portal.
{{55049764-6-16242:}}Which riddles will you solve, I wonder? You need only complete some to prove yourself. But choices, as always, say much about the chooser.
{{55049764-6-16248:}}Soar suspended by your good intentions, Not-Ulfsild. The clinic is in the town of Suran, on the isle of Vvardenfell. \n\nThe knight will be an effervescent addition to your trial. I just know it.
{{55049764-4-16002:}}Torvesard somehow directed that reality tear right toward you. If Curate Gadayn hadn't leapt in the way …. \n\nWe won't let his sacrifice be in vain. Let's get that fragment to Leramil and Scruut.
{{55049764-4-16009:}}Continue on, friend. I'll be right behind you.
{{55049764-3-16144:}}I serve the Prince of the Many Paths, and so I abide by her will. But I cannot understand allowing you and that other Ithelia to remain here. Not now, when the end is so near.\n\nSpeak to her as she wishes and go. We have urgent business to attend to.
{{55049764-8-15973:}}I think we did what was needed here, friend. Finish placing the remaining relics. I'll see you back in Skingrad when you're done.
{{55049764-8-15972:}}Get on with it, mortal. Use the spell scroll I gave you. That's the only way to release the relic's energy and repair the damage to reality.
{{55049764-8-15971:}}We've made more progress here in a day than any explorer in centuries! Let's take the lesser stone back to the great welkynd stone and see if it fits into one of the sockets.
{{55049764-8-15975:}}We may have won a few victories, but Nantharion and the Recollection are still out there, and these Daedric incursions are getting worse. West Weald isn't safe yet, comrade.
{{55049764-7-16210:}}In all his travels, Keshargo has learned that Oblivion is filled with things no mind can anticipate. \n\nThe ghost lights are headed up with some determination. There's a chance that they are the key to leaving the sunken ruins.
{{55049764-15-16130:}}Now that we have a moment, allow me to introduce myself. Nahlia, Votary knight in the Order of the Lamp. Pleasure to make your acquaintance. \n\nIrnard briefed you on our situation?
{{55049764-27-16043:}}Ah, my comrade from Rustwall! What luck. I need your help once again. Do you hear the sounds of combat? The fight for Feldagard Keep already rages.\n\nWhen I learned of an impending attack, I raced to warn them, but I arrived too late.
{{55049764-1-15978:}}<<<1>> appears agitated and eager to tell you something.>
{{55049764-1-15972:}}Apocrypha is saved, reality preserved, and the threads of fate are untangled—thanks to you. \n\nI never imagined mortals could be so … capable.
{{55049764-1-15973:}}It was an honor to work by your side, my friend. Thank you for helping me stop the Recollection and save West Weald—and everything else we wound up saving in the process!\n\nI'm just glad I got to throw this little celebration before you departed.
{{55049764-1-15970:}}You can find Baroness Eliana Cossa just inside the town walls. The entrance to Leftwheal is just north of Feldagard Keep. Let her know Grimmer sent you.
{{55049764-1-15971:}}An ancient quarrel between Daedric Princes is beyond me, friend. But it's clear Mora attempted to reason with Ithelia. She willfully ignored his warning. And was too strong for him to overpower without help.
{{55049764-1-15976:}}<<1>> made it back safely. And <<2>>, too! Thanks for going to find them. I really appreciate your help.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm going to pamper my husband and help him forget his ordeal. Nothing but the best for <<1>>!
{{55049764-1-15977:}}<<1>>! Thank the Three! I wondered where you ran off to. Did <<1>> bring you to me, stranger? She's such a good girl!
{{55049764-1-15975:}}Not sure how a location in the Weald gets us to Oblivion, but I'd like to hear if Leramil can tell us anything about the place.
{{55049764-10-16183:}}Something keeps tugging on my robes! Like a child playing a game. But no one's there.\n\nIt's the Netch, isn't it? This blob of yours is testing my patience.
{{55049764-10-16182:}}There are so many awe-inspiring creatures whose shape this Luminary might have taken. Indrik. Dragon. Gryphon!\n\nAnd yet, it's a Netch. It's rather silly. But perhaps that's the entire point.
{{55049764-10-16184:}}How goes your dealings with the Dragon? Any more riddles to solve?
{{55049764-10-15983:}}That wisp in the air … what is it? What does it mean? I've never seen anything quite like it.
{{55049764-10-15981:}}There must be something here. Look around, but carefully. According to the Skein, Nantharion used the Staff of Many Paths here not long ago.
{{55049764-3-16308:}}Don't worry, I will do my very very best to ensure I have what you're looking for. I take my role as Chronicler for this expedition quite seriously!
{{55049764-11-15798:}}The library door is to the left when you enter the manor. No one has touched the scene, on Aquilia's request.
{{55049764-11-15793:}}Just pick up the bucket and splash the victims with what's inside. No need to be delicate about it.
{{55049764-20-15793:}}A single, very small sip, for experimental purposes only, and already my guts burn with fire. This wine is definitely dangerous to my kind, so why are these vampires here to bid on it?
{{55049764-2-16062:}}Singer be praised. To see the rite enacted after all these years.
{{55049764-2-16060:}}Look at them up there. I think I'm going to cry.
{{55049764-2-16061:}}The garden of my heart is bursting with love. I can't believe it.
{{55049764-6-16255:}}The Fox told us about his plan when we chatted earlier. It sounds like an incredible project. \n\nJust be careful, all right? The Daedric Princes aren't known for their good humor.
{{55049764-7-15991:}}I feel better having warned King Nantharion about the dangers posed by the Recollection. Now let's go find that cart!\n\nOh, and I know you want to ask about Ninglenirre Pass. Can we save that for later? It's somewhat embarrassing.
{{55049764-7-15998:}}I have been scouring the planes for hints of Torvesard's doings. I sensed ripples of probability flowing across the Daedric realms.  Imagine my surprise when I traced them to their origin—ancient Miscarcand.\n\nWhat happened there?
{{55049764-10-15850:}}Don't look at me like that. You would have done the same thing in my shoes.
{{55049764-9-16269:}}It's so good to be able to stretch my limbs, to breathe deep again. I'll need to go flying soon to truly shake off this chill.\n\nBut first. We have business, you and I.
{{55049764-10-15856:}}Greetings, proxy. I knew fate would draw you here. New troubles emerge in these lands—the footprints of the once-forgotten Prince now free. And where the Prince walks, disturbance and disorder follow.\n\nBut that is how we shall find her.
{{55049764-1-15788:}}If you think you're ready, then off you go. The Legion has work ready for those willing to do the job.
{{55049764-2-16264:}}This is awful. She's not just my vanity, she's my rage.
{{55049764-2-16265:}}If only I had the energy to drown myself. I can't even do that.
{{55049764-2-16266:}}The altar won't do … you know, more altar things, unless you go imbue the Gryphon's power into the altar.\n\nThat's outside. In the main hall. Go!
{{55049764-2-16268:}}Well, hello there, gorgeous. You fancy a drink?
{{55049764-2-16269:}}The ritual is complete. The Scholarium is safe. And you are a shield for Ulfsild's legacy, just as much as I am.
{{55049764-1-15782:}}A good officer gives credit where credit is due. You did good here, comrade. Rustwall won't be ready to host any visiting dignitaries for a while, but we learned the fate of my cohort and stopped an invasion.\n\nNot bad for a day's work.
{{55049764-1-15785:}}These ruins sound dangerous. We should be prepared for trouble, friend.
{{55049764-1-15786:}}It's hard to believe Curate Gadayn is gone. We knew those tears in reality were dangerous, but to lose one of our own ….
{{55049764-10-15778:}}Tell Scruut what we saw and explain your idea. Let us see if it sparks any ideas of her own.
{{55049764-1-16349:}}That ballista has great range. When it's working, that is.
{{55049764-1-16340:}}I hope you find more of my neighbors out there. We should never have come back to Ostumir. Rebuilding in all this jungle? Feh. Too much work.\n\nAnyway, I'll stay here and help watch over the camp.
{{55049764-5-16321:}}Not sure I'll ever go back in Legion's Rest. Bugs. So many bugs.
{{55049764-14-15960:}}I knew Balandrus was angry when I left the gang. But to destroy a town and raise an army ….\n\nHe's really trying to live up to his new name—the Terror of the Weald.
{{55049764-1-16192:}}Pim always talked about how dangerous entering a Goblin's camp was. I was trying to stay away from the Goblins, but I guess I should have been looking to stay away from the traps instead. \n\nYou found a knife? Can I see it?
{{55049764-22-15793:}}A large gathering of vampires typically means trouble, but I've seen no evidence of violence as yet.\n\nLet's be very careful in how we proceed. We don't want to accidentally set off a blood frenzy, now do we?
{{55049764-8-16178:}}Rest easy, I would not set you to task without cause. There is method to my mindset.\n\nIn the meantime, you have many questions. Mortals always do.
{{55049764-8-16170:}}I'll meet you at the Lady's standing stone in Auridon. \n\nHow nice it'll be to really stretch my wings again.
{{55049764-23-15960:}}I don't like what Rosalyn told us. Imagine, a vampire army.\n\nLet's head outside. Grivier's a good scout, but even the best leave a trail if you know what to look for. We follow Grivier and we find Tham—and maybe learn where Balandrus is hiding.
{{55049764-12-16266:}}He's got you doing safeguards for him? See? He likes you!
{{55049764-30-15793:}}Let's keep looking around. I'll try to make sure nothing catches us by surprise. Plenty of places to lurk unnoticed in this vineyard.
{{55049764-1-16106:}}It took us years to build this city and now it's all gone up in flames. What a nightmare.
{{55049764-1-16107:}}Thank you for coming to our aid, traveler. You're a light in the dark.
{{55049764-1-16104:}}You have my thanks. The shame I would feel had I left the others behind ….
{{55049764-1-16105:}}I need a moment to clear my lungs, but I'll make my way to safety shortly, I promise.
{{55049764-1-16103:}}Greetings, wanderer. Do you hear the wisps? I do. They bear fortunes and portents of things to come. If you cannot hear them, I'd be happy to share what they say about you.
{{55049764-5-16129:}}Heard about the pest problem, have you? Quite confounding. \n\nTo think we've reclaimed this priceless trove of ancient resources only to fall victim to rats. Or what have you.
{{55049764-2-16184:}}I'm just grateful I got a chance to help you out. Seeing this ancient library come to life around us?\n\nIt's so different than my normal work. And far more fulfilling.
{{55049764-2-16180:}}Go east and you'll find where the Daedra dug up from below. Drop down and keep going east. You'll know the portal when you see it. Break those anchors and I bet the portal closes.\n\nI'll try and lead the Recollection away and then find you down there.
{{55049764-2-16183:}}Color me intrigued. Just what have you and Nahlia been up to while you've been gone?
{{55049764-2-16182:}}You're back! And with some success, I hope? What happens when you fully restore the altar?
{{55049764-2-15980:}}I thought Dawnwood was a blessing, a sign from the Green. Now … I'm not so sure.
{{55049764-2-15981:}}The Skein was right—Ithelia used her power here. There was no doorway into these ruins before this one suddenly appeared. According to this legionary, Tribune Alea witnessed the whole thing and went charging in after them!
{{55049764-2-15982:}}The people of Vashabar wish only to live in Dawnwood in peace. We are not invaders. We do not seek to displace the Colovians. But the Green has given us this forest and we mean to make full use of that blessed gift.
{{55049764-2-15983:}}Nantharion got away, damn it. Shardmarshal Vargas, too. At least we stopped them from using this wildburn seed at Skingrad.\n\nTalk to Beragon, will you? I'm afraid he's taking this pretty hard.
{{55049764-2-15984:}}Go on ahead. I'll catch up to you and Tribune Alea just as soon as I see to these injured legionaries.
{{55049764-2-15985:}}Nantharion and Ithelia are at the well, and Beragon is going after them! We need to get in there and help him, comrade. Use Abolisher and open a portal!
{{55049764-2-15987:}}Take a look at the Skein of Secrets. If Ithelia returned to Mirrormoor—wherever that is—then perhaps the Skein can show us how to follow her.\n\nIt's worth a try, anyway.
{{55049764-11-16129:}}Excellent. The anomaly is in an old complex called Sunnamere beneath the Sunhold Mages Guild.\n\nGood luck. Hopefully the rest of us won't be far behind you.
{{55049764-19-16043:}}We have our orders. Reset the traps around the keep and burn those ropes. I have one more order. Take down as many Daedra as you can.\n\nLet's get to it.
{{55049764-4-15975:}}We need to figure out what happens now that Nantharion's dead and the Recollection is scattered.\n\nBut first, the strange High Elf has returned and wants to talk to you, comrade. You'd better see what she wants. And pray it's good news for a change.
{{55049764-4-15973:}}Hermaeus Mora wants to speak with you? I hope that doesn't mean there's another reality-ending threat to deal with. No, of course not. Probably just wants to thank you.\n\nBut don't take too long. I rehearsed my speech and everything!
{{55049764-4-15972:}}Beragon insisted on holding a celebration, but he refused every one of the suggestions I made. I'll have you know the ciphers consider me indispensable at all their social functions!\n\nAnyway, good work with the relics. The Great Eye is pleased.
{{55049764-4-15971:}}I'm beginning to think the Ayleids built this place specifically to protect the Skein until someone with both Abolisher and the Lamp of Clarity came along to reclaim it.
{{55049764-9-16266:}}We've barely thawed out the Gryphon and now we're going on an adventure to steal magic from Daedric Princes! Isn't that exciting?\n\nOh, oh, I'd better start some stretches. Don't want to cramp up.
{{55049764-9-16264:}}Good work. That's one less facet to worry about.
{{55049764-0-16165:}}So Nantharion was evil and the leader of the Recollection? He fooled us all so well!\n\nAt least Count Calantius is willing to meet with Greenspeaker Darolith. That's a good thing, right?
{{55049764-0-16164:}}So the Recollection has been defeated and Dawnwood is safe? All of West Weald, I suppose. And Greenspeaker Darolith and Count Calantius are talking. I guess that's good.\n\nStill, maybe it's time for me to return to Valenwood.
{{55049764-0-16167:}}Thank you for not letting Legionary Thania's death be in vain. I feel my strength slowly return every time I look at the fires. \n\nAs soon as help arrives, we'll strike back! Varen's Watch will be ours again in no time.
{{55049764-0-16166:}}With negotiations underway with Skingrad, we should also turn our attention to things here in Vashabar. We still need to find a way to reconcile the differences between the Green Pact and the Dawnway
{{55049764-0-16161:}}I wish I got to attend the celebration. I'd really like to thank the hero of West Weald for all they did. Oh, I'm sure Tribune Alea helped, too. She's very capable.\n\nAnd they held it in a Wood Elf's townhouse! I wonder what was wrong with the palace?
{{55049764-0-16160:}}What am I forgetting? It's right there, but just out of reach! It's so frustrating!\n\nAnd I wasn't invited to the celebration! I never get to go to anything interesting.
{{55049764-0-16163:}}This has been a most interesting day, interloper. Almost worth all the stress and lost feathers.
{{55049764-0-16162:}}I am going to be able to return to my research with a new perspective on Goblins. Although I might keep my notes to myself for a bit. \n\nMaybe I can stop the next Jerntann by delaying my publications.
{{55049764-0-16169:}}Let me guess. You're here to help Votary Nahlia. She wants an outsider's perspective.\n\nI'm not sure why, but I guess it's good that you're here.
{{55049764-26-16043:}}What good fortune that you're here, comrade. That report we found in Hoperoot was a reconnaissance of Feldagard Keep. That could only mean an attack was imminent. I raced to warn them, but I arrived too late from the sound of it.

{{103224356-0-65626:}}I need to meet Tribune Alea at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and talk to Beragon.
{{103224356-0-65627:}}I found the couple in an overgrown ruin. I should tell them the good news about the Rite of Propagation.
{{103224356-0-65629:}}I rescued Belienne's fear from the spiderweb, earning her trust. I should talk to her.
{{103224356-0-63664:}}We exiled Ithelia and ended her threat to our reality. Now I should use the portal and rendezvous with my allies in Beragon's townhouse.
{{103224356-0-63662:}}Ithelia indicates that her prison is only a temporary solution. She is a Daedric Prince, and her power will always find a way to restore her. I should talk to her and see if we can find a different solution.
{{103224356-0-63663:}}I need to talk to Hermaeus Mora and see what he thinks of Ithelia's solution.
{{103224356-0-63660:}}Torvesard has taken the power of both Hermaeus Mora and Ithelia for himself. I need to defeat him before he gains control of all that power and becomes unstoppable.
{{103224356-0-63661:}}We defeated Torvesard. Now Hermaeus Mora wants us to enter the portal and go to Ithelia's prison so we can finally put the dilemma of the Forgotten Prince to rest once and for all.
{{103224356-0-63481:}}I defeated the Recollection leaders and retrieved some Recollection communiques. I should return to <<1>> and claim my reward.
{{103224356-0-63469:}}I defeated Stri the Fate-Eater and recovered the equipment of the fallen egionaries. I should return them to <<1>> and claim my reward.
{{103224356-0-63465:}}The Skein of Secrets led us to a hidden passage. I should see what awaits us deeper inside.
{{103224356-0-65475:}}The Gryphon was frozen by Ulfsild before the Scholarium was lost. If I'm going to speak to the Luminary I'll have to free him from this magic by dispelling Ulfsild's ward.
{{103224356-0-65474:}}The Fox gave me the final page of the Gryphon's fable. I should read it to learn the location of the Gryphon's door.
{{103224356-0-65477:}}I should talk to Legionary Luther about the cub.
{{103224356-0-65476:}}The Gryphon has been freed. I should speak to him about earning his favor and advancing my studies of Scribing.
{{103224356-0-65473:}}I gathered the third fragment of the Gryphon's key, and the Fox appeared again. I should see what it wants.
{{103224356-0-64707:}}With the first fragment of the Indrik's key in my possession, the Crow wants to speak to me once more.
{{103224356-0-65138:}}Captain Dartorius said she ordered her legionaries to retreat to Fort Hastrel. I should head there and see if I can determine what happened to Legionary Ulrath and the rest of the squadron.
{{103224356-0-65139:}}I decided to tell Captain Dartorius the lie Legionary Ulrath suggested. That he died along with the rest of the squad. I should give his report to the captain and collect my pay.
{{103224356-0-65435:}}I should listen to what Ulfsild's echo has to say about the Gryphon and their wing.
{{103224356-0-65437:}}Belienne's despair asked me to bring her some flowers to try to lift her spirits. She saw some growing by the river.
{{103224356-0-65436:}}I found Belienne's despair sitting by the river. I should speak with her.
{{103224356-0-64576:}}We seem to have found the source of the magical disturbance. I should speak to Votary Nahlia about what to do next.
{{103224356-0-64965:}}The True-Sight lens was right where the echo of Ulfsild said it would be. I should bring it to the Crow to see what comes next.
{{103224356-0-64967:}}The Crow instructed me to read the Fable of the Indrik. The text should be somewhere right here in the Scholarium Main Hall.
{{103224356-0-65482:}}I helped Tribune Alea discover the fate of her missing cohort and stop a planned invasion of Skingrad. I should talk to Tribune Alea and make sure the threat here has been contained.
{{103224356-0-63771:}}I need to continue my search for King Nantharion. He must be somewhere higher in the tree-fortress.
{{103224356-0-63777:}}We narrowly escaped from Hoperoot before the wildburn destroyed it. Beragon wants to speak with me before we leave. I should talk to him.
{{103224356-0-65541:}}The Fox is going to guide us over the chasm. I'll need to use focal points to break any wards I find so he can sniff out the way forward.
{{103224356-0-65540:}}Nahlia and I came across a chasm looking down into the Labyrinthian maze, but no way down or across. The Fox appeared, offering his aid. I should speak to him.
{{103224356-0-65543:}}We made it through the maze and arrived to find the Crow. I should speak with her.
{{103224356-0-65542:}}We made it across the invisible pathway with the help of the Fox. We should continue on to see what comes next.
{{103224356-0-65545:}}I defeated Aut'arioth, Inheritor's Bane. I should speak to the Crow.
{{103224356-0-65544:}}The Crow asked for a demonstration of our power. I should defeat Aut'arioth, Inheritor's Bane to showcase what I've learned in restoring the altar.
{{103224356-0-65546:}}The Crow revealed her original form to me and Nahlia. I should speak to her.
{{103224356-0-64234:}}I need to enter Varen's Watch and look for these rubble piles.
{{103224356-0-63468:}}I found <<1>> tending to a few townsfolk at the entrance to Leftwheal. I should speak with her about what has caused this destruction.
{{103224356-0-63464:}}The Skein of Secrets revealed a path. I should follow it and see where it leads.
{{103224356-0-64269:}}We have a plan to defeat Shardmarshal Vargas and take the portal-opening blade from her. Tribune Alea told me get in place near the gateway, then we'll attack from both sides. I should get to my designated position as planned.
{{103224356-0-64268:}}While we watched, Shardmarshal Vargas used a blade to open a portal inside the armory. Daedric reinforcements came through and the portal closed. I should talk to Tribune Alea about this development.
{{103224356-0-64263:}}We entered the keep's barracks, and Tribune Alea wants to talk to me. I should find out what's on her mind.
{{103224356-0-64262:}}The plan worked. We held back the waves of Daedra so I could target them with the ballista. Just when the weapon broke again, a group of Daedra stormed the courtyard through the north door. I should head there and take out the attackers.
{{103224356-0-65338:}}I have one page of the Fable of the Gryphon. Thankfully, its annotations tell me exactly where I'm meant to go to find the first set of wards. I can use the fable page in my pack as a guide for where to go.
{{103224356-0-65333:}}The Gryphon's power has amplified the altar, and another Wing of the Scholarium has been restored. I should speak with Votary Nahlia.
{{103224356-0-65330:}}I should take Legionary Ulrath's report to Captain Dartorius and tell her what happened to Ulrath. I can either tell her the truth or make up a lie.
{{103224356-0-65331:}}I decided to tell Captain Dartorius that Legionary Ulrath survived and was leaving the Legion. I should give his report to the captain and collect my pay.
{{103224356-0-65336:}}Nahlia found an echo that might shed light on how to proceed with entering the Wing of the Gryphon. It's just nearby.
{{103224356-0-65337:}}Nahlia saw a fox running about the Scholarium with pages in its mouth. It dropped one when she confronted it. I should read the fable page she recovered from the fox.
{{103224356-0-65334:}}That's strange, the Fable of the Gryphon is missing its pages. As I picked it up, Votary Llaren and Julian approached me. Perhaps they know something about this.
{{103224356-0-65335:}}Llaren mentioned an incident where the Fable of the Gryphon was vandalized. Votary Nahlia is trying to follow up with notes Ulfsild left behind. I should seek her out in the east wing.
{{103224356-0-63040:}}I should talk to Tribune Alea and figure out what to do with the sword we acquired, Abolisher.
{{103224356-0-63041:}}I should talk to Maerenah and see if the threat of the Terror of the Weald is truly over.
{{103224356-0-63046:}}I should talk to Orissa and give her the wine I recovered from Legion's Rest.
{{103224356-0-63047:}}I should talk to Lepida Russus and give her Haldain's possessions as the note in the journal requested.
{{103224356-0-63044:}}I found and freed the Aetherial shards in Silorn using the Aetherial Alarum. I should speak to Toutis Mido about my reward.
{{103224356-0-63045:}}<<1>> is grateful for my help in protecting the town of Leftwheal. I should speak with her about next steps.
{{103224356-0-63048:}}I halted the ritual by collecting all the ritual items and burning the bodies the necromancers were using. I should meet with Priest Faric outside.
{{103224356-0-63049:}}I retrieved what I could of Grander Nemarcet's stolen dowry. I should return it to him and tell him the truth about the brigand who robbed him.
{{103224356-0-65071:}}I made it out of the citadel and placed the arcane knot into the null arca. I should talk to Keshargo now.
{{103224356-0-65070:}}I made it out of the citadel and placed the arcane knot into the null arca. I should talk to Keshargo now.
{{103224356-0-65073:}}Keshargo will want to see what I found, but it won't be safe enough to show him until the arcane knot is in the null arca.
{{103224356-0-65072:}}Keshargo will want to see what I found, but it won't be safe enough to show him until the arcane knot is in the null arca.
{{103224356-0-65075:}}I have recovered a Ghost Light Bottle. I should give it to Keshargo.
{{103224356-0-65074:}}I recovered a Ghost Light Bottle. I should give it to Keshargo.
{{103224356-0-65077:}}Valaria Calidius said that someone named Neletai would know what happened to the expedition and their attackers. I should find Neletai and talk to her.
{{103224356-0-65076:}}I have recovered a piece of Living Glass from Xoryn. I should give it to Keshargo.
{{103224356-0-65079:}}The portal that Valaria Calidius made can take me to Lucent Citadel.
{{103224356-0-65078:}}I need to talk to Neletai outside the Lucent Citadel.
{{103224356-0-65279:}}To prove my worth, the Netch has presented me a number of game challenges. I need to complete three from the list. I can decide which tasks I wish to take on to prove myself worthy of the Luminary's power.
{{103224356-0-65278:}}The Netch wants me to complete a few game challenges to prove my commitment. I should review the challenges it has set out.
{{103224356-0-65277:}}The Wing of the Netch is connected back to the Scholarium. I should speak to the Netch again to learn what comes next.
{{103224356-0-65276:}}The Netch has asked that I place the Fable on a dais near a door. This will connect the path from its wing back to the Scholarium once more.
{{103224356-0-65275:}}I found the secret door to the Wing of the Netch. I should enter and speak to the Netch Luminary.
{{103224356-0-65273:}}I collected the fragments and formed the key to the Netch's door. To enter the Wing of the Netch, I should make for the final location indicated in Ulfsild's annotations.
{{103224356-0-65272:}}The wards are dispelled and the third key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-64633:}}By looking through the True-Sight Lens, I've revealed annotations within the Fable of the Indrik. I should read the book again and see what Ulfsild had to say.
{{103224356-0-64634:}}I read the Fable of the Indrik and viewed the annotations left by Ulfsild. I should talk to the Crow about what comes next.
{{103224356-0-64636:}}The Crow landed near the standing stone and seems eager to talk. I should see what comes next.
{{103224356-0-64637:}}To enter the Indrik's domain I need to open its door. To do that, I need to form a key. I need to use the True-Sight Lens at focal points in the area to reveal wards, dispel them, and unveil the hidden key fragment nearby.
{{103224356-0-63943:}}Now that the altar has been activated, we can find out what it is protecting ahead. I should catch up with <<1>>.
{{103224356-0-63945:}}We found a tile puzzle in the center of Wendir. <<1>> thinks the solution is related to the nearby epitaph. I should take a look at the epitaph.
{{103224356-0-63944:}}I should check in with <<1>>. He seems excited about some kind of epitaph he's found.
{{103224356-0-63367:}}Fennorian suggested we split up and mingle with the guests at the pre-auction party. I should question the guests without arousing too much suspicion.
{{103224356-0-63366:}}Fennorian and I made it inside. I should speak to Fennorian before we investigate further.
{{103224356-0-63365:}}Fennorian wants to investigate the auction next. We're posing as an invited vampire and his guest, using the invitation that Fennorian took from another vampire.
{{103224356-0-63364:}}After talking to an injured field hand, checking out the vineyard's new grapes, and examining a dead death hound, Fennorian wants to talk about what we may have learned.
{{103224356-0-63362:}}Fennorian wants to start our investigation on the grounds of the estate. I should help him search the vineyard.
{{103224356-0-63369:}}Fennorian advised me to enter the manor and search Lord Gallio Valente's office while he has a discussion with Lady Ursilia Valente.
{{103224356-0-63368:}}I talked to several guests at the event. One of them knows Fennorian. I need to let him know before the auction starts.
{{103224356-0-65755:}}Legionary Ulrath wrote a report on the events that led to the death of the soldiers under Captain Dartorius's command. He left it for someone to find, but asked me to take it back to the captain. I should look for it.
{{103224356-0-64404:}}I should search for Lord Gallio Valente's alchemical laboratory.
{{103224356-0-64401:}}Beragon told me my help is needed at Feldagard Keep and Outcast Inn. I must help Tribune Alea and Leramil the Wise, then return to Skingrad and check in with him.
{{103224356-0-64400:}}Beragon was concerned about situations at Feldagard Keep and the Outcast Inn. Since my investigation of those sites is complete, I should talk to him about what happened and what I learned.
{{103224356-0-63750:}}King Nantharion isn't here, but I found more wildburn seeds—and an Echonir memory. I should destroy the seeds and observe the memory.
{{103224356-0-63757:}}Beragon wants to start by visiting the Wood Elf town of Vashabar. He hopes to consult with a greenspeaker there about the wildburn seed we found in Ostumir.
{{103224356-0-63755:}}Beragon wants to talk to me about the Echonir memory we observed beneath Fort Dirich.
{{103224356-0-63758:}}Beragon suggested we show the wildburn seed to Greenspeaker Darolith in Vashabar. I should find her and show her the seed.
{{103224356-0-63759:}}Beragon wants to warn King Nantharion that some of his followers might be connected to the Recollection before we head out to investigate the cart Greensinger Darolith told us about.
{{103224356-0-65433:}}Belienne asked me to look for the facet of her despair near a river south of Skingrad.
{{103224356-0-65434:}}Belienne's final facet turned a woman into a pig. I should speak with Belienne to help her decide what to do now.
{{103224356-0-65481:}}Tribune Alea and I followed Legionary Caepio's route to escape the caverns underneath Rustwall. I should speak to Tribune Alea and learn what she thinks of our adventure.
{{103224356-0-64151:}}Constable Yabren's father's journal noted that he planned to interview the owners of the ranch and the quarry next. Yabren asked me to do that while she looks into the death of the town healer.
{{103224356-0-64152:}}I met with Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee. Now I should meet Constable Yabren at the Stonechip Gambling Den to tell her about my investigations.
{{103224356-0-64157:}}Constable Yabren isn't here and Ghrakug has been injured. I should talk to him.
{{103224356-0-63656:}}After a grueling battle, I weakened Ithelia enough to create an opening. Now I need to use the Mirror of Truth and show her how the power of the Loom has corrupted her.
{{103224356-0-63473:}}I defeated Fang and Talon and destroyed the training supplies at the Goblin camp. I should report my success to <<1>> and claim my reward.
{{103224356-0-63860:}}I used Abolisher to open a portal. I should step through and see where the portal leads.
{{103224356-0-63861:}}The portal led us to a strange desert ruin in a place Leramil called Fargrave. Beragon and Tribune Alea haven't yet emerged from the portal. I should talk to Leramil before we proceed.
{{103224356-0-63862:}}Masses of crystal encrust the ruins here. Leramil thinks they may be a a sign Ithelia passed through this area. I should follow the crystals and see where they lead.
{{103224356-0-63863:}}We found a door leading to the Inner Quarter of Fargrave. We should continue inside.
{{103224356-0-63864:}}The crystal path continues through this section of Fargrave. I should keep following it as I look for Shardmarshal Vargas and Ithelia.
{{103224356-0-63865:}}Shardmarshal Vargas banished Beragon and Tribune Alea to the Many Paths, so Leramil and I continued on our own. We found a lingering memory in the ruins. I should use the Echonir and see what it reveals.
{{103224356-0-63866:}}The Echonir memory revealed a long-ago conversation between Torvesard and Shardmarshal Vargas. I should consult with Leramil the Wise about what we heard.
{{103224356-0-63869:}}Leramil believes Ithelia came here for the Loom of the Untraveled Road that Shardmarshal Vargas was fixated with in that ancient memory. We need to find a way to reactivate this dormant portal.
{{103224356-0-63138:}}I should search Fyrelight Cave and retrieve what I can of Grander's stolen dowry.
{{103224356-0-63133:}}I should search Legion's Rest with Orissa Dellinoi for Lazen and the stolen Blue Aedral.
{{103224356-0-63131:}}Nahlia is going to return to the Mages Guild and get their advice on what to do next. I should speak to her about her plans.
{{103224356-0-64703:}}Tribune Alea and I entered the ruins below the catacombs. We found more Recollection down here guarding the way. We need to keep searching to find the portal.
{{103224356-0-65650:}}I have the map that Groundskeeper Gaius drew to lead us to the location of the catacombs key. It points to a statue in the nearby gardens. I should find the gardens and look for the statue.
{{103224356-0-65658:}}Scruut wants me to return to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and consult with Leramil on our next steps to stop Ithelia and preserve reality.
{{103224356-0-64386:}}Constable Yabren asked me to start our investigation by becoming familiar with other recent deaths that have plagued the town. She suggested I start by examining the newer grave markers.
{{103224356-0-64388:}}I examined the most-recent grave markers as Constable Yabren suggested. I should talk to her about anything I noticed.
{{103224356-0-64389:}}I spoke to Ghrakug, the ranch overseer, and the quarry boss. And I found Constable Ulbren's notebook in the constable's office. I should return to Yabren and tell her what I learned.
{{103224356-0-64525:}}Votary Nahlia has stabilized the portal. We should enter together.
{{103224356-0-64526:}}Votary Nahlia and I entered the strange portal. The source of the untamed magic seems to be coming from further in.
{{103224356-0-64527:}}I need to meet my allies at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and figure out a way to repair the tears in the fabric of reality.
{{103224356-0-64521:}}Irnard opened a portal to Sunnamere, where Votary Nahlia is waiting for me. I should seek her out.
{{103224356-0-64522:}}Votary Nahlia greeted me and suggested we head inside. I should proceed into the study to seek out this anomaly.
{{103224356-0-64523:}}The unstable magic is a portal at the far end of the study. I need to speak to Votary Nahlia to find out what this is all about.
{{103224356-0-63450:}}I need to enter Fort Colovia through the side passage so I can find the communique, the bell tower key, and the cohort payroll.
{{103224356-0-63415:}}Haldain's sister, Lepida Russus, has a room at the Fertile Respite in Skingrad. If I make my way there, I can fulfill Haldain's last wish.
{{103224356-0-63414:}}Haldain's journal said that his belongings can be found at his workbench nearby. I should take them.
{{103224356-0-63416:}}I found Lepida Russus. I should let her know what I found in Haldain's Lumber Camp.
{{103224356-0-63411:}}I gathered Reachfolk trinkets from Varen's Watch. Now I should return to <<1>> to claim my reward.
{{103224356-0-63410:}}Now that I'm inside Varen's Watch, I need to search the rubble piles for any Reachfolk trinkets I can find.
{{103224356-0-64273:}}I entered the portal and arrived in a place very different than Feldagard Keep. As they fought, Tribune Alea Idolus knocked Abolisher from Shardmarshal Vargas's hand. In response, Vargas summoned Daedra to fight us. I should eliminate the enemy.
{{103224356-0-63454:}}Now that I have the communique, the bell tower key, and the cohort payroll, I need to climb to the top of the bell tower and ring the chimes in the proper sequence to alert the rest of the Imperial Legion.
{{103224356-0-63994:}}The Ithelia of this path tells me that Sage's Dream will help the Ithelia of my reality regain control of her power and disperse the tangled threads hanging over the inn. I can gather tirum weed here.
{{103224356-0-63995:}}I gathered the tirum weed and the alternate Ithelia opened a portal back to my reality. I should step through the portal and return to the inn's cellar.
{{103224356-0-63990:}}At the center of a large chamber containing a shrine, I found a different Ithelia from the one I met at the inn. She called me over to speak. I should talk to this alternate Ithelia.
{{103224356-0-63456:}}Legionary Calvo volunteered to stay behind and keep ringing the bell until Legion reinforcements arrive. I should exit Fort Colovia and report back to Captain Dromius Terrus.
{{103224356-0-63204:}}I found Betu with Chef Edric. I should grab the will while the dog is distracted.
{{103224356-0-63205:}}I should talk with Chef Edric now that I've secured the will.
{{103224356-0-63206:}}Aquilia Verres informed me that her late aunt's will is missing and that I should speak to Mizzik Thunderboots if I wish to help.
{{103224356-0-63207:}}I need to speak to Tribune Alea Idolus to begin my search for the missing legionaries. I can find her in the Rustwall Estate's courtyard. I should head there now.
{{103224356-0-63203:}}<<1>> needs to find the will <<2>> the dog stole during his investigation at Weatherleah. I should follow the tracks.
{{103224356-0-64164:}}I helped Constable Yabren learn the truth about her father's death and bring his killers to justice. Now I should talk to her about what happens next for her and the town of Ontus.
{{103224356-0-64890:}}Pim has concerns after seeing what happened at the Bitterfish camp. She asked me to join her at the nearest Sharp Tooth camp to investigate further.
{{103224356-0-64891:}}I arrived at the Sharp Tooth Goblin camp. Pim and I need to investigate the camp.
{{103224356-0-63396:}}To destroy the laboratory, Fennorian suggests I turn the flame valves under the fermentation vats all the way up. That will increase the pressure and cause them to explode.
{{103224356-0-65147:}}Inside Fort Hastrel, I located Legionary Ulrath and a number of fallen legionaries. I should speak with Ulrath and get his side of the story.
{{103224356-0-64235:}}I need to find the desk that this key opens and see if I can learn anything about what's going on here.
{{103224356-0-64236:}}The key unlocked the desk and revealed a letter from Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee to Alchemist Surius.
{{103224356-0-64237:}}I should enter Legion's Rest so I can look for crystaljack venom crystals.
{{103224356-0-64230:}}I destroyed the wildburn seed before the ritual was completed. I should listen to what Nantharion is saying, because something is going very wrong.
{{103224356-0-64232:}}We came upon a desk and Constable Yabren spotted a key. I should take the key.
{{103224356-0-64238:}}I need to go to the Haldain Lumber Camp south of Skingrad and recover Legion tool packs loaned to the camp workers while they awaited the arrival of their own supplies.
{{103224356-0-65305:}}We found Beragon, but Nantharion and Ithelia have reached the Ayleid well. I need to use Abolisher to get past a locked gate and reach them.
{{103224356-0-65304:}}I was pranked by the Netch, and Nahlia came to investigate the noise. I should speak to her.
{{103224356-0-65308:}}The arcane knot is somewhere within the Lucent Citadel. I should explore the citadel to find it.
{{103224356-0-64917:}}The wards are dispelled and the first key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-64916:}}I freed Bella. I should talk to her and see if we can find out any other information.
{{103224356-0-64911:}}I should listen to the Echo of Ulfsild to hear her advice about the Dragon Luminary.
{{103224356-0-64910:}}Nahlia suggested I listen to an echo in the east wing that might have advice for how to contend with the Dragon Luminary.
{{103224356-0-64913:}}I found Ulfsild's annotated fable. I can use the hints in Ulfsild's annotations to find the Dragon wards in Reaper's March. I can also ask my allies in the Scholarium for help.
{{103224356-0-64912:}}The Echo of Ulfsild said to seek her annotated fable "at the meeting of many paths. A room full of doors with no hinges." I should seek this location in the Scholarium or ask Nahlia for help with to decipher this riddle.
{{103224356-0-64919:}}The wards are dispelled and the second key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-64918:}}With the second key fragment collected, I continue my journey for more Dragon wards. I should use the fable as a reference to see where to search next.
{{103224356-0-64644:}}The wards are dispelled and the second key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-64640:}}The wards are dispelled and the first key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-64642:}}I'm on my own, the Crow has returned to the Scholarium. I need to find the set of wards hiding the second Indrik key fragment. I can use the fable in my pack as a guide.
{{103224356-0-64646:}}With the first and second key fragments collected, I continue my journey for more Indrik wards. I should use the fable as a reference to see where to search next.
{{103224356-0-64648:}}The wards are dispelled and the third key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-63915:}}I should head into the underground ruins and confer with <<1>> about what we found.
{{103224356-0-63916:}}I should talk to <<1>> about what we hope to find in Wendir.
{{103224356-0-63917:}}According to Narsis Dren, there is an altar inside the ruin that will grant us access to the Emblem of the Last King. To operate it, I need to collect three items from the Recollection: a Vial of Blood, Aromatic Wine, and Sacred Water.
{{103224356-0-64319:}}I found a campsite in Hastrel Hollow with several dead Wood Elves. There's one survivor here. I should talk to him.
{{103224356-0-65490:}}I followed the voices of Beragon and Greenspeaker Sorilen until they led me out of the ruins. I exited to find Beragon standing alone. I should talk to him about his friend and the wildburn seed I gathered.
{{103224356-0-63891:}}I found a Recollection map and some documents. This may be valuable intelligence. I should gather whatever I can.
{{103224356-0-63892:}}I think there's a memory nearby. I should use the Echonir to reveal it and see what it contains.
{{103224356-0-63894:}}Search the Offices
{{103224356-0-63896:}}The strange shawl we found activated an Echonir memory.
{{103224356-0-65721:}}I found Tribune Alea Idolus trapped by enemies emerging from a portal. I need to find a way to close the portal.
{{103224356-0-65722:}}Laeni and Clendagal enacted the rite, and the village gave them permission to wed. I should talk to Laeni to see how she's taking the news.
{{103224356-0-63769:}}Recollection fighters in King Nantharion's new settlement can't be good. I need to reach the king.
{{103224356-0-63768:}}Beragon thinks King Nantharion is likely on one of the tree-fort's upper platforms. I need to find a way up and look for the king.
{{103224356-0-63763:}}I found another wildburn seed. This one looks charged and ready to sprout. I need to destroy it before that happens.
{{103224356-0-63762:}}I should look for the covered cart east of Leftwheal that Greenspeaker Darolith told me about. If it contains more wildburn seeds, we need to destroy them.
{{103224356-0-63760:}}Beragon and I reached King Nantharion. Beragon wants me to warn him about the Recollection. I should talk to him.
{{103224356-0-63767:}}Tribune Alea distracted the sentries. Now's my chance to slip into Hoperoot undetected.
{{103224356-0-63766:}}Tribune Alea called to me. I should go meet her.
{{103224356-0-63765:}}I found Beragon near Hoperoot. He told me that the gate sentries were hostile to him and Tribune Alea, but the tribune has a plan to get inside. She's waiting for me near the gate.
{{103224356-0-63764:}}I destroyed the wildburn seed, but it's obvious these Recollection forces were expecting us. If a Recollection spy is working in Vashabar, King Nantharion is in danger. I should talk to Beragon about our next move.
{{103224356-0-64038:}}Torvesard directed me to the ingredient we need, lute berries. I should gather them and leave before the Ithelia of this realm destroys everything that exists upon this path.
{{103224356-0-64039:}}I gathered the lute berries. Now I should use the portal opened by the Ithelia of my reality to return to the inn's cellar.
{{103224356-0-64032:}}Ithelia and I arrived at different location in the same shrine as before. However, the place feels gloomy this time. Ithelia urged me forward to find the next ingredient. I should explore this new path.
{{103224356-0-64033:}}This alternate Ithelia seems depressed and resentful over her approaching imprisonment. However, she directed me to the next ingredient, harkfruit. I should take the harkfruit so I can leave this path.
{{103224356-0-64030:}}Ithelia directed me to another path in the ruins. I should use the Lamp of Clarity to reveal the doorway to the Many Paths.
{{103224356-0-64031:}}The Lamp of Clarity revealed another doorway to the Many Paths. I should step through and see where this path leads.
{{103224356-0-64037:}}This time the Many Paths led us to a shrine caught in the midst of battle as the forces of Ithelia and Hermaeus Mora clash. I need to explore this path and find the final ingredient.
{{103224356-0-64034:}}I gathered the harkfruit for Sage's Dream. Ithelia learned to open a portal and created a doorway back to the inn. I should step through.
{{103224356-0-64035:}}Ithelia directed me to another path in the ruins. I should use the Lamp of Clarity to reveal the doorway to the Many Paths.
{{103224356-0-64999:}}Hooke asked me to find three old members of his gang and convince them to meet him at the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge.
{{103224356-0-64996:}}The Skein of Secrets revealed a path. I should follow it and see where it leads.
{{103224356-0-65022:}}Hooke wants my help searching the ruins of Caelum Vineyard for signs of Marcan. I should search the vineyard.
{{103224356-0-65020:}}I found the killer's knife beside Naku's corpse. It bears a strange symbol on it. I should bring it to Hooke in the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge and see what he makes of it.
{{103224356-0-65021:}}Hooke believes the killer is Marcan Caelum, master of a manor the Scarlets accidentally burned down years ago. He asked me to meet him there along with the rest of the Scarlets.
{{103224356-0-65029:}}After discovering signs of Marcan's presence at Caelum Vineyard, Hooke wants to discuss our plans. I should talk to him.
{{103224356-0-65220:}}Beragon noticed Recollection notes near the great welkynd stone. I should examine them to see what we might learn.
{{103224356-0-65223:}}The Dragon has tasked me with crafting a riddle she cannot solve. I should speak with Nahlia and the Crow for help on completing this trial.
{{103224356-0-65598:}}During our search, a legionary quietly got our attention from behind a grate. I should talk to the legionary and see what information he can provide.
{{103224356-0-65596:}}Leramil and I arrived in Apocrypha. She wants to talk to Hermaeus Mora first. I should listen to their exchange.
{{103224356-0-65597:}}Leramil wants to speak to me before we head out. I should talk to her.
{{103224356-0-65595:}}Solving her puzzle revealed a focal point in my trial. I should use it and break any wards I see, that might allow me to move forward.
{{103224356-0-63330:}}I should speak with <<1>> in the city of Skingrad to get more details about these jobs.
{{103224356-0-63331:}}I need to find and gather venom crystals from crystaljack wasps in Legion's Rest.
{{103224356-0-63332:}}I gathered the venom crystals from crystaljacks. I should return to <<1>> to claim my reward.
{{103224356-0-63335:}}I defeated Spinner Urthrendir and burned the illusory mushrooms in Fall's Glade. I should report back to <<1>>.
{{103224356-0-63336:}}I need to find and defeat Spinner Urthrendir in the forest overgrowth of Fall's Glade, which lies southwest of Skingrad. I should also burn any mushrooms growing in the glade to disrupt his ritual.
{{103224356-0-64702:}}Legionary Caepio told us that the Recollection and their Daedric allies killed everyone but him. He says the Daedra opened a portal below the catacombs to bring in more soldiers. I need to find this portal.
{{103224356-0-65410:}}Legionary Luther gave me treats for Burnbiscuit. I should follow the trail of apples to find him.
{{103224356-0-63811:}}Beragon suggested scouting the area around Niryastare to find the best way into the ruins.
{{103224356-0-63810:}}I arrived at Niryastare. I should locate Beragon and speak with him.
{{103224356-0-63813:}}Beragon believes we'll find stairs down to Niryastare's vaults in the middle of the stockade. Or we could try another way to get in.
{{103224356-0-63815:}}We discovered a vault door protected by a darkened crystal—a great welkynd stone. I should speak with Beragon about how we get past the door.
{{103224356-0-63814:}}We entered Niryastare's subterranean halls. The Skein of Secrets is hidden somewhere in here. I should keep exploring.
{{103224356-0-63817:}}There seems to be a strange glow in the air. Beragon thinks the Lamp of Clarity might reveal something here.
{{103224356-0-63816:}}Beragon believes the long-dead great welkynd stone can be restored using lesser stones. We should look around for crystals that fit in the sockets of the Ayleid apparatus.
{{103224356-0-63466:}}At the end of the hidden passage, Hermaeus Mora spoke to me and opened a portal into the Mythos. I should enter the portal and continue to search for Ithelia.
{{103224356-0-63463:}}Now that we're in Apocrypha, I should use the Skein of Secrets and see if I can pick up Ithelia's trail.
{{103224356-0-64865:}}The Dragon's power has amplified the altar, and another Wing of the Scholarium has been restored. I should speak with Votary Nahlia.
{{103224356-0-63214:}}I entered the barracks and found Tribune Alea near the dead body of Captain Leronus. She found a letter on the captain. I should read the letter and see what it contains.
{{103224356-0-65406:}}I rescued Burnbiscuit the bear cub. Now to reunite him with Count Calantius.
{{103224356-0-65407:}}I should investigate the wreckage.
{{103224356-0-63608:}}Innkeeper Brynmir seems excited to try out his personal drink making machine. I should follow his instructions carefully to prepare the perfect Sage's Dream.
{{103224356-0-64363:}}The Skein of Secrets revealed the location of the Ayleid ruin of Wendir, but we have no idea why. We can only assume that we can pick up Ithelia's trail there, so I need to head to Wendir.
{{103224356-0-63440:}}I need to look for tharrikers inside Fyrelight Cave and recover claws, fangs, feathers and eggshells from the creatures for study.
{{103224356-0-65171:}}The Mythos changes and warps as Ithelia's hold on Apocrypha strengthens. I must reach Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum and find a way to stop the Forgotten Prince.
{{103224356-0-63189:}}I need to search the ruins of Ceyond to locate the Primordial Shattered Titan.
{{103224356-0-63188:}}Scruut has an idea to create a relic that might help Ithelia change. To create it we need something tied to Ithelia. Scruut suggested I go to the ruins at Ceyond and find the Primordial Shattered Titan.
{{103224356-0-63187:}}We returned to Beragon's townhouse. I should talk to Scruut and tell her about the memory and the idea Leramil and I discussed.
{{103224356-0-63186:}}Ithelia, now full of rage and power, plans to take control of Apocrypha and make it her own realm. We must somehow change her from this destructive course, so we need to return to Beragon's townhouse and consult with Scruut.
{{103224356-0-63185:}}I reached the Loom. Now to use the Echonir and see if there are any lingering memories to reveal.
{{103224356-0-63184:}}Now that I returned to Fargrave, I should make my way to the Loom of the Untraveled Road.
{{103224356-0-63183:}}Leramil and Scruut think I can use the Echonir to reveal lingering memories at the Loom of the Untraveled Road. These memories may point us to where Ithelia has gone. I should use Leramil's portal to travel to Fargrave.
{{103224356-0-63182:}}I returned to Beragon's townhouse. Now I should speak with Leramil.
{{103224356-0-63181:}}I restored the three Daedric artifacts. I should return to Beragon's townhouse to see what Leramil and Scruut think we should do next.
{{103224356-0-63180:}}Scruut wants me to try to restore the Daedric relics at three locations she marked on my map. I need to take the relics and meet my allies in the Telvanni Peninsula, West Weald, and Apocrypha.
{{103224356-0-65801:}}Maerenah suspects that another bloodfiend den can be found deeper inside the mine. We should find it and collapse it as well.
{{103224356-0-65809:}}Nahlia and a group from the Mages Guild has returned to the Scholarium. I should find her and see how her meeting with the Guild went.
{{103224356-0-63478:}}I need to find and defeat Hessedaz the Baleful at Fortune's Bluff and recharge the rune-covered sentry spheres protecting the area.
{{103224356-0-63477:}}I defeated Hessedaz the Baleful and recharged the sentry spheres. I should report back to <<1>>.
{{103224356-0-63474:}}I need to head northwest of Skingrad to Centurion's Rest and find the Goblin camp. Once there, I need to slay the guard tharrikers, Fang and Talon, then destroy the training supplies.
{{103224356-0-63470:}}I need to find and defeat Stri the Fate-Eater and recover any Legion equipment left behind by the legionaries who were last sent on this mission.
{{103224356-0-64697:}}Leramil believes Ithelia and Shardmarshal Vargas have reached the core of the Loom. We need to find them before Ithelia uses the Loom to rewrite history and destroy everything we know.
{{103224356-0-65355:}}I've opened the doorway into the Wing of the Gryphon, where I've found the Luminary itself apparently frozen. I should speak to the Fox to learn what happened here.
{{103224356-0-65352:}}The wards are dispelled and the third key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-65353:}}I collected the fragments and formed the key to the Gryphon's door. To enter the Wing of the Gryphon, I should make for the final location indicated in Ulfsild's annotations.
{{103224356-0-65680:}}I gathered the wildburn seed. Now I should follow after Beragon and catch up with him.
{{103224356-0-64550:}}We found Maerenah's friend Tham. She asked me to talk to him while she composes herself.
{{103224356-0-64552:}}A strange blast of magical energy blew through the unstable portal. Nahlia asked me to investigate a few things that appeared in the study while she stabilizes the threshold.
{{103224356-0-63685:}}Maerenah wants us to start at Tham's Tavern, inside the town of Sutch.
{{103224356-0-63686:}}Maerenah asked me to search Tham's Tavern. We're looking for survivors or for any messages that Tham may have left for her to find.
{{103224356-0-63689:}}Maerenah and I found a note from Tham, a tattered cloak, and a bloodied sword. I should talk to her and see if she has an idea about what happened here.
{{103224356-0-63957:}}We found Greenspeaker Sorilen while rescuing survivors. She invited Beragon to Ostumir to show him something she found in the nearby Ayleid ruins. She wants us to meet her there.
{{103224356-0-63024:}}We recovered the three relics once used to defeat Ithelia—the Skein of Secrets, Abolisher, and the Lamp of Clarity. I should talk to Beragon about what we should do next.
{{103224356-0-63025:}}We defeated King Nantharion at Miscarcand. I should check in with Beragon to see what else he thinks we need to do here.
{{103224356-0-63026:}}At the townhouse, I met with my allies and spoke to the leaders of Skingrad and Vashabar. Now I should talk to Beragon about all we accomplished in West Weald.
{{103224356-0-63027:}}We completed the ritual and created a new relic, the Mirror of Truth. I should talk to Leramil and see how she's doing.
{{103224356-0-63022:}}Now that we're all at Beragon's townhouse, I should talk to Leramil about what we learned.
{{103224356-0-63023:}}We learned that Nantharion is the leader of the Recollection, that Ithelia seeks the Outcast Inn, and Feldagard Keep is in danger. I should discuss this with Beragon.
{{103224356-0-63028:}}I returned to Beragon's townhouse. Now I should speak with Leramil.
{{103224356-0-63029:}}I should talk to Leramil about all that happened and see what she's thinking.
{{103224356-0-64943:}}I opened the Wing of the Dragon and amplified the Scribing Altar with the power of the Dragon. I should speak to Nahlia.
{{103224356-0-65523:}}I've placed the key and restored the Altar of Scribing to its full potential. I should speak to Nahlia one last time.
{{103224356-0-65527:}}Ulfsild's echo mentioned I could enter the final trial with allies. As I finished listening, Nahlia approached. I should talk to her, and ask her to join me.
{{103224356-0-65526:}}There's an echo from Ulfsild near the entrance to the Wing of the Crow. The Crow wants me to listen to Ulfsild's message before we begin.
{{103224356-0-66195:}}I should seek out Adept Irnard to learn more about this magical anomaly and the Votary's call for aid. He should be at the location marked on my map.
{{103224356-0-64036:}}The Lamp of Clarity revealed another doorway to the Many Paths. I should step through and see where this path leads.
{{103224356-0-66350:}}I destroyed the Loom of the Untraveled Road. I should observe what Ithelia does next.
{{103224356-0-65193:}}I should gather the old guzzard from Marcien's trap and bring it to <<1>>.
{{103224356-0-65198:}}I should gather Versidue from the trap and deliver it to Star-Gazer Sariyaah.
{{103224356-0-64245:}}Entering the keep from the front looks impossible. Tribune Alea knows of a side entrance, though. I should find the entrance and enter Feldagard Keep.
{{103224356-0-64244:}}We arrived at the marketplace overlook near Feldagard Keep's entrance. Daedra already surround the area with a large force grouped at a breach in the wall. I should discuss next steps with Tribune Alea.
{{103224356-0-64247:}}I recovered the remedy for Betu from the pantry. I need to return to the hall to help Betu.
{{103224356-0-64241:}}I should enter Fyrelight Cave and see if I can find evidence of tharrikers inside.
{{103224356-0-64242:}}I should enter Nonungalo so I can begin my investigation of the ruins.
{{103224356-0-63738:}}Beragon wants me to use the Skein of Secrets so I can see the locations where he thinks King Nantharion has been using the Staff of Many Paths.
{{103224356-0-63739:}}Legionary Caepio told me Beragon wants to speak with me about King Nantharion's threat to West Weald. I should go to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and talk to him.
{{103224356-0-64003:}}I need to place the Daedric relics around the fragment to begin the ritual.
{{103224356-0-64002:}}Leramil and Scruut prepared a ritual circle. I should place the Shattered Titan fragment in the center.
{{103224356-0-65019:}}Naku was killed right before my eyes. I should see if I can find anything near his corpse to help me learn more about the killer.
{{103224356-0-65018:}}I found Naku arguing with someone cloaked up on a mining scaffolding deeper inside Fyrelight Cave, but there's no way up. I should learn what I can from their argument.
{{103224356-0-65017:}}I found a letter at Naku's camp. It instructed Naku to go to a meeting in Fyrelight Cave. I should see what I can learn there.
{{103224356-0-65016:}}Hooke found the location of another former Scarlets member, Naku. I can make contact with him at his mining claim south of Skingrad.
{{103224356-0-65015:}}I met with Hooke's former comrades. I should report back to him. I can find him at the Skingrad Outlaws Refuge.
{{103224356-0-65258:}}I found the real Fable of the Netch. I should use the hints in Ulfsild's annotations to find the Netch's wards in Vvardenfell. I can also ask my allies in the Scholarium for help.
{{103224356-0-65253:}}The Echonir revealed a memory of Ithelia cornered by Hermaeus Mora. In the memory, she retreated to the north. I should investigate that section of the ruins.
{{103224356-0-65252:}}Tribune Alea and I reached a deeper section of Miscarcand, but we still haven't caught up with King Nantharion. We should keep going.
{{103224356-0-65255:}}The Crow has directed me to an Echo of Ulfsild. I should see if it holds any clues as to where the Fable of the Netch has gone.
{{103224356-0-65254:}}This book titled Nable of the Fetch doesn't appear to be the fable that I was looking for. I should speak to the Crow to see what I can do.
{{103224356-0-65257:}}Nahlia helped me provoke a reaction from the Netch. I should follow the Luminary's illusionary squirrels to see where they lead me.
{{103224356-0-65256:}}I activated the echo, but the Netch has replaced it with one of its own design. I should see what it has to say.
{{103224356-0-65344:}}I'd just gathered the first fragment of the Gryphon's key when a strange fox appeared and spoke. I should see what the talking fox wants.
{{103224356-0-64613:}}The doors have been sealed, but the altar remains unstable. I should find Votary Nahlia to learn what to do next.
{{103224356-0-64616:}}My first adventure with a Luminary has reached an end. I should talk to Nahlia and prepare for my next journey.
{{103224356-0-63968:}}We witnessed the memory of an event that occurred after we destroyed the Loom. I should talk to Leramil about what we just saw.
{{103224356-0-63965:}}Greenspeaker Sorilen revealed herself as a member of the Recollection. Beragon told me to get the wildburn seed while he goes after his friend. I should take the wildburn seed and follow after him.
{{103224356-0-63964:}}Greenspeaker Sorilen says she brought Beragon here to show him the wildburn seed. She wants us to find it while she tries to lead off at least some of the Recollection forces.
{{103224356-0-63967:}}The Echonir revealed a recent memory of Ithelia. I should observe it.
{{103224356-0-63966:}}A villager fleeing Ostumir told me to find Beragon in a camp on the northern road out of the village. I should find the camp and talk to Beragon.
{{103224356-0-63961:}}Greenspeaker Sorilen wrote a note on the Recollection orders we found telling us she went deeper into the ruins. Beragon and I should enter the Ayleid ruins and search for his friend.
{{103224356-0-63960:}}The note contained orders to the Recollection to take something called a wildburn seed from beneath the Ayleid ruins near Ostumir. I should talk to Beragon about what that might mean.
{{103224356-0-63963:}}We found Greenspeaker Sorilen. I should talk to her and find out what she brought Beragon and I into these ruins to see.
{{103224356-0-63962:}}Beragon and I entered the Ayleid ruins near Ostumir. While he wants to find out more about the wildburn seed and what the Recollection is up to, he's more anxious about finding his friend. I should search the ruins for Greenspeaker Sorilen.
{{103224356-0-63340:}}I helped defeat a Mirrormoor incursion. I should return to <<1>> to report my success.
{{103224356-0-63349:}}I recovered the abandoned tool packs from Haldain Lumber Camp. I should deliver them to <<1>> and claim my reward.
{{103224356-0-63348:}}I need to retrieve tool packs on loan from the West Weald Legion that I should be able to find throughout the Haldain Lumber Camp.
{{103224356-0-64150:}}Constable Yabren asked me to interview a few of the townsfolk, notably Ghrakug, the ranch overseer, and the quarry boss—all people her father was planning to interview before he died. She also asked me to examine her father's office.
{{103224356-0-64735:}}Lady Ursilia Valente caught me searching her husband's office. I should tell her what Lord Valente is really planning.
{{103224356-0-65774:}}I should seek out Constable Yabren in the graveyard outside the town of Ontus if I'm interested in the job.
{{103224356-0-65779:}}We entered the Sutch Mine. We need to find and collapse the bloodfiend dens deeper inside.
{{103224356-0-65216:}}The Dragon wants me to complete a few riddle challenges to prove my commitment. I should review the challenges it has set out.
{{103224356-0-63848:}}We observed the memory of an ancient confrontation between Ithelia and Hermaeus Mora. I should talk to Beragon about what we learned.
{{103224356-0-63849:}}We recovered the Skein of Secrets from Niryastare. We should return to Beragon's house in Skingrad.
{{103224356-0-63846:}}I reached the relic known as the Skein of Secrets in Niryastare's vaults. I should take it.
{{103224356-0-63847:}}The wispy manifestation of a memory-echo appeared nearby. I should see what the Echonir reveals here.
{{103224356-0-63453:}}I need to search Fort Colovia to find the communique containing the proper chime sequence, the bell tower key, and the cohort payroll.
{{103224356-0-63455:}}Now that I'm inside the bell tower, I need to climb to the top and ring the bell in the proper sequence to alert the Legion.
{{103224356-0-63457:}}I should tell Captain Dromius Terrus about what happened inside Fort Colovia and turn over the cohort payroll I recovered.
{{103224356-0-65093:}}I recovered the Goblin tribes' totems. I should give them to Pim as soon as possible.
{{103224356-0-65098:}}Ithelia and Hermaeus Mora have agreed to send the Prince of Paths to a distant reality where her power doesn't exist instead of simply returning her to prison and starting the cycle again. I should watch what happens.
{{103224356-0-65637:}}According to the fable, our search for the Indrik starts in Auridon. I should meet the Crow at the standing stone of the Lady.
{{103224356-0-65633:}}We enetered the Sutch Depository. We should look around for survivors.
{{103224356-0-65639:}}Belienne's delight asked me to acquire a cask of West Weald Wallop.
{{103224356-0-65638:}}Greenspeaker Darolith explained that the wildburn seed is a corrupted greenspring seed. She sensed strange energy within the seed, possibly Daedric in origin. I should talk to Beragon about what we just learned.
{{103224356-0-64320:}}Ithelia and Torvesard sealed the entrance to Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum with magical wards. I must use the Skein of Secrets to locate these wards.
{{103224356-0-64326:}}The Skein of Secrets pointed me to a Colovian farmstead. I should investigate the site.
{{103224356-0-64327:}}I should investigate Hastrel Hollow and see if I can determine what King Nantharion was doing there.
{{103224356-0-63678:}}The treasure <<1>> brought me may belong to Weatherleah Estate's missing fortune. I should follow him to see where it was found.
{{103224356-0-64419:}}I halted the ritual by gathering the ritual items and burning the corrupted corpses. Priest Faric asked me to meet him outside the ruins.
{{103224356-0-65395:}}I should ask Leramil the Wise what she knows about what the Skein of Secrets revealed to us.
{{103224356-0-65871:}}Tribune Alea and I closed the Daedric portal while Legionary Caepio found us an exit. I should head outside and talk to Tribune Alea.
{{103224356-0-65870:}}The memory shows Ithelia cornered by Hermaus Mora. I should observe what happens next.
{{103224356-0-64261:}}I repaired the ballista with the parts I found. It's now ready for combat. I should get on the ballista and prepare to execute Commander Merian's plan.
{{103224356-0-64260:}}Commander Merian plans to make a wall of fire to hold back the Daedra. I should use the bucket of oil to pour oil on the barricade.
{{103224356-0-64267:}}After a search through the barracks, Tribune Alea and I entered the armory below the keep. There, we found the commander of the Daedric forces. I should watch to see what she's up to.
{{103224356-0-64266:}}Tribune Alea Idolus expressed confusion over how the Daedra got inside. She also wondered about who leads this Daedric assault. I should join her search of the keep's barracks to find out how the enemy got in.
{{103224356-0-64265:}}Tribune Alea believes the remaining Daedric forces have come from somewhere inside the keep. She suggested we go into the barracks below and look around. I should join her on the search.
{{103224356-0-65718:}}I discovered a location where Abolisher can be used. I should see if I can open a portal to get us out of here.
{{103224356-0-65440:}}The flowers gave Belienne's despair enough motivation to return to her primary self. I should speak with Belienne and learn what other facets are still missing.
{{103224356-0-65442:}}I should feed the bear cub the treats.
{{103224356-0-65443:}}Leramil needs a moment to process what happened to Curate Gadayn. Meanwhile, I should give the fragment to Scruut and discuss our next steps.
{{103224356-0-65444:}}I should return with the bear cub to Legionary Luther.
{{103224356-0-65445:}}The wards are dispelled and the first key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-65446:}}The Fox gave me the next page of the Gryphon's fable. I should read it to continue my journey.
{{103224356-0-65447:}}Belienne became overwhelmed with despair after merging with her facet. She asked me to search for her delight in Stonechip Tavern in Ontus.
{{103224356-0-65448:}}I discovered Belienne's delight drinking in Stonechip Tavern. I should speak with her.
{{103224356-0-65449:}}I should drink with Belienne's delight to see if I can convince her to return to Belienne.
{{103224356-0-64718:}}I witnessed a memory of Ithelia and King Nantharion discussing a hidden well of power in a place called Miscarcand. Beragon suggested we meet outside and discuss the implications of what we saw.
{{103224356-0-64713:}}I found a passage leading down into the dungeons below the ruins of Fort Dirich. I should investigate.
{{103224356-0-64712:}}I met Beragon at Fort Dirich.I should look for clues as to what King Nantharion was doing here.
{{103224356-0-63842:}}The lesser stone restored a glimmer of light to the great welkynd stone. I should locate and retrieve the three remaining lesser stones.
{{103224356-0-63843:}}I collected the remaining three lesser welkynd stones. I should return to the great welkynd stone and place each one in its proper socket.
{{103224356-0-63840:}}I used the Lamp of Clarity to reveal a lesser welkynd stone. I should return to the darkened great welkynd stone and see if it fits into one of the sockets.
{{103224356-0-63844:}}Reawakening the great welkynd stone of Niryastare revealed the entrance to a vault. Perhaps we'll find the Skein of Secrets within.
{{103224356-0-63845:}}A collapsed staircase blocks our exploration of the vault, but this looks like a problem I can solve with the blade Abolisher.
{{103224356-0-66389:}}I need to find and destroy the second Mirrormoor ward to open the way to Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum.
{{103224356-0-65229:}}I took the bait from Marcien. I should throw it away or remove it from the area so the guzzards will leave them alone.
{{103224356-0-64975:}}The Indrik wants me to complete a few challenges to prove my commitment. I should review the challenges he's set out.
{{103224356-0-65579:}}We appear to be trapped in Ithelia's ancient prison. I found an anomaly in the mirrored walls. Leramil suggests I use the Lamp of Clarity to reveal what is hidden here.
{{103224356-0-63226:}}Groundskeeper Gaius confirmed that the legionaries and staff hid in the catacombs for safety from the mysterious attacks. He stashed the key, but drew me a map so I could find it. I should grab the map to begin my search.
{{103224356-0-63224:}}I stopped the Recollection's ritual in Leftwheal. I should meet up with <<1>> outside the town walls to inform her of our success.
{{103224356-0-63225:}}We need to search Groundskeeper Gaius's home and find either him or the catacomb key.
{{103224356-0-63222:}}<<1>> saw townsfolk still trapped amid the rubble and a series of rituals to summon in more attackers. She asked me to deal with the Recollection and free the injured townsfolk.
{{103224356-0-63223:}}I found <<1>> with the rescued townsfolk. I should let her know that we addressed the imminent threat.
{{103224356-0-63221:}}<<1>> flagged me down requesting aid on behalf of Leftwheal. I should find the town's leader, <<2>>, to get a grasp on the situation.
{{103224356-0-64216:}}<<1>> discovered <<2>> dead in the library. I should investigate the scene.
{{103224356-0-65329:}}The forager described a tear that could be the instability we're looking for. I should enter Faro's Cavern and take a look.
{{103224356-0-65325:}}We arrived at the site of the instability that Scruut detected, but all we found was a man whose connection to the threads of fate is frayed. I should speak to him.
{{103224356-0-65326:}}I found the tear in reality inside Faro's Cavern. I should examine it.
{{103224356-0-63051:}}I found Captain Abitius and two legionaries interrogating a Recollection soldier. I should talk to her and claim my reward.
{{103224356-0-63050:}}I helped Legionary Calvo Dorso reach the bell tower and signal for reinforcements. Now I should talk to Captain Dromius about my reward.
{{103224356-0-63052:}}The Goblins seem to be placated now that Pim has the totems. I should speak to her to finish helping out.
{{103224356-0-65046:}}With Hooke's help, we were able to save Valenia and escape the cellar underneath Caelum Vineyard unharmed. I should speak with Hooke.
{{103224356-0-65040:}}I found Marcan Caelum holding Valenia with a knife to her throat. I need to confront him and save Valenia before it's too late.
{{103224356-0-65041:}}Hooke asked me to keep Marcan distracted so he can free Valenia and get her to safety. I need to keep the killer talking until Hooke has freed her.
{{103224356-0-64508:}}I should return to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and rejoin my allies.
{{103224356-0-64509:}}Now that I returned to Beragon's townhouse, I should find Beragon and make sure he's all right.
{{103224356-0-64506:}}Count Calantius of Skingrad and Greenspeaker Darolith of Vashabar are here. The count wants to have a word with me. I should talk to him.
{{103224356-0-64507:}}Beragon suggested I store the depleted relics in the display case. I should place them there now.
{{103224356-0-64500:}}I need to continue my search for King Nantharion. He must be somewhere higher in the tree-fortress.
{{103224356-0-65286:}}I've completed the Luminary's trial. I should return to the Wing of the Netch and see what it has to say.
{{103224356-0-65287:}}I opened the Wing of the Netch and amplified the Scribing Altar with the power of the Netch. I should speak to Nahlia.
{{103224356-0-65288:}}The Netch told me that Nahlia and I are going to allow a man a chance to speak with his son one last time. I need to speak with Nahlia before traveling to the dying man's side.
{{103224356-0-64629:}}I found a pedestal with one of Ulfsild's echoes. I should listen to what it has to say.
{{103224356-0-64628:}}The Crow said Ulfsild left echoes behind for whoever would follow in her footsteps. There should be an Echo in the main hall to start me on my path.
{{103224356-0-64627:}}If anyone can help me learn about Scribing and the Luminaries, it's the Crow. I should speak with her about next steps.
{{103224356-0-63937:}}We found the altar that <<1>> had mentioned earlier. I should go to it with items we've gathered.
{{103224356-0-63930:}}When I approached the reality tear, something happened. Scruut wants to talk to me about it.
{{103224356-0-63938:}}We found the altar that <<1>>  mentioned earlier. Now I need to figure out which of these items is the correct one for activating the altar. I could talk to <<1>> for more information about the items.
{{103224356-0-65056:}}Ithelia's very presence seems to be transforming Apocrypha into Mirrormoor. I need to keep going and reach Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum.
{{103224356-0-65055:}}The way forward appears blocked, but Leramil suggests I use the Lamp of Clarity and see what it reveals.
{{103224356-0-65740:}}I defeated King Nantharion but Shieldmarshal Vargas took the Staff of Many Paths and used it to draw power from the well and give it to Ithelia. I should observe what happens next.
{{103224356-0-65747:}}With the Gryphon's sigil in hand I should return to the Scribing Altar. Infusing the altar with the power of the Gryphon will enhance my connection with scripts and grimoires around the world.
{{103224356-0-65746:}}The Gryphon will make use of the stolen creatia to enact his ancient rite. I should watch the ritual unfold and then claim the sigil of the Luminary's power.
{{103224356-0-64296:}}The survivor I found in Hastrel Hollow told me the Recollection attackers went into nearby ruins. I should investigate.
{{103224356-0-64297:}}The old well led down to a cave with an underground stream. I should look around down here.
{{103224356-0-64293:}}I destroyed the wildburn seeds King Nantharion planted at the sites revealed by the Skein of Secrets. I should return to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and tell Beragon what I learned.
{{103224356-0-63741:}}I should investigate the locations revealed by the Skein of Secrets and report back to Beragon about what I discover.
{{103224356-0-63740:}}The Skein of Secrets revealed two locations. I should talk to Beragon about how to proceed.
{{103224356-0-63749:}}I should explore the dungeons beneath the old fort. There may be another wildburn seed here.
{{103224356-0-63748:}}The Skein of Secrets revealed a new site where the Staff of Many Paths has been used. Beragon wants me to meet him there.
{{103224356-0-63192:}}I should let Leramil know what happened to Curate Gadayn.
{{103224356-0-64318:}}Everything is ready. I should assist Laeni and Clendagal in enacting the Rite of Propagation.
{{103224356-0-64313:}}Agawen Ciiril is excited about the possibility that Laeni and Clendagal might be able to stay in the village. I need to take the scroll detailing the rite to the couple. They should be in their hidden meeting spot within a nearby overgrown ruin.
{{103224356-0-64312:}}I found an old scroll detailing the Rite of Propagation in the Wilderhall. The rite may offer the couple a way to appeal to the village for permission to marry. Spinner Belwelas suggested I talk to Agawen Ciiril before talking to Laeni and Clendagal.
{{103224356-0-64311:}}<<1>> mentioned a Wood Elf custom called the Rite of Propagation. He believes it might offer a solution to Laeni and Clendagal. He directed me to the Wilderhall, where the village preserves and honors its history.
{{103224356-0-64315:}}The couple need to gather symbolic items to complete the Rite of Propagation. They asked me to help. Laeni and I will go to the site where the village began growing Vashabar, while Clendagal will accompany me into a nearby Ayleid ruin.
{{103224356-0-65206:}}I freed Marcien from their net. I should talk to them to find out what happened.
{{103224356-0-63812:}}Beragon and I found more than one way into the stockade surrounding Niryastare. I should talk to him about which entrance he thinks we should use.
{{103224356-0-65203:}}Sariyaah said Trapper Marcien's camp is to the north of Ontus. I should travel there and see what I can learn.
{{103224356-0-63208:}}Tribune Alea seems impatient to find her missing legionaries. She wants us to search the nearby manor house for clues to where everyone went. I should enter the manor and take a look around.
{{103224356-0-65204:}}I got the guzzards to disperse. Now, I should free Marcien from their net.
{{103224356-0-63313:}}I found the body of <<1>> on the ground by a memorial. I should examine the scene.
{{103224356-0-63310:}}I found Betu outside the library. He seems to be tracking a trail. I should follow him!
{{103224356-0-63316:}}The imposter Uriel is accusing <<1>> of killing <<2>>. I should question <<3>> and see if her story has changed.
{{103224356-0-63317:}}<<1>> is certain <<2>> could not have brought the tea that day. She accused <<3>> of poisoning the tea, and murdering <<2>> to cover up the crime. I need to speak to <<3>>.
{{103224356-0-63314:}}I found a note on the body along with foul-smelling tea and a tainted tankard. I should talk to <<1>> about this.
{{103224356-0-63315:}}I should speak with the imposter Uriel Weatherleah without revealing what we discovered at the site of the memorial.
{{103224356-0-63318:}}<<1>> reveals that Pelena finished brewing the tea for <<2>> that day, countering <<3>>'s claim that she was not there that morning. I should investigate the scene where they met for tea.
{{103224356-0-65713:}}With the Dragon's sigil in hand I should return to the Scribing Altar. Infusing the altar with the power of the Dragon will enhance my connection with scripts and grimoires around the world.
{{103224356-0-65283:}}I've completed the games set out by the Netch. Time to return to the Luminary and see what comes next.
{{103224356-0-63712:}}Inside Nonungalo, I need to burn the bodies fueling the spell and gather the ritual items. This will stop the undead necromancers.
{{103224356-0-65439:}}I gathered the river flowers. I should deliver them to Belienne's despair.
{{103224356-0-63873:}}We encountered another Echonir memory inside the Loom of the Untraveled Road. I should see what it shows.
{{103224356-0-63872:}}We appear to have reached a dead end. I should use the Skein of Secrets to locate Ithelia and find us a path.
{{103224356-0-63871:}}I entered the Loom of the Untraveled Road. It's not an apparatus, but a place. I should explore this area.
{{103224356-0-63870:}}I used the mirrors to activate the dormant portal. Shardmarshal Vargas said the Loom of the Untraveled Road lies beyond it. I should enter the portal.
{{103224356-0-63877:}}Shardmarshal Vargas redirected Leramil's portal, depositing us in Ithelia's ancient prison. However, there's a memory here. I should use the Echonir to reveal it.
{{103224356-0-63874:}}Something went wrong when I tried to use the Skein of Secrets. I should let Leramil examine the Skein and talk to her about what happened.
{{103224356-0-63879:}}I found Beragon trapped within the broken mirrors of Ithelia's prison! Leramil thinks the Lamp of Clarity can pull him out of the Many Paths and back to our reality.
{{103224356-0-63878:}}We appear to be trapped in Ithelia's ancient prison. Leramil the Wise wants us to look around for a way to escape.
{{103224356-0-63297:}}<<1>> wants to speak to me in private about the contents of the will. He asked me to join him in the study.
{{103224356-0-63296:}}<<1>> is revealing the will to the family. I should stay and hear what it says.
{{103224356-0-63295:}}<<1>> asked me to help out with the investigation. I should meet him at the manor to talk to the family about the will.
{{103224356-0-63294:}}I recovered the will. I should hand it to <<1>> and tell him about my conversation with <<2>>.
{{103224356-0-63299:}}The will mentions a dog several times as an important hint. I should see if there are any clues in the study that relate to <<1>>'s dog.
{{103224356-0-63298:}}<<1>> asked me to read the will myself and see if I can solve the riddle.
{{103224356-0-63482:}}I need to locate the Recollection camp and defeat their leaders meeting there. I should also retrieve any information I find at the site.
{{103224356-0-63486:}}I defeated Oakenclaw and put up the warning bulletins. Now I should report back to <<1>> and collect my reward.
{{103224356-0-63487:}}I need to find and defeat Oakenclaw and place warning bulletins in the area.
{{103224356-0-64866:}}Pim and I found several signs of antagonism at the Bitterfish camp. She has some suspicions on what is going on and wants to talk to me.
{{103224356-0-63446:}}I should investigate the ruins of Nunungalo for any dangers, hazards, or structural problems the Legion should be aware of.
{{103224356-0-63447:}}I investigated Nonungalo as requested and should deliver my findings to Commandant Salerius so I can claim my reward.
{{103224356-0-65668:}}Innkeeper Brynmir was waiting for me in the inn's cellar. I should give him the ingredients I gathered so he can prepare the Sage's Dream.
{{103224356-0-64391:}}This arch was important to Shardmarshal Vargas. She was drawn to this place and spent a lot of time here in the centuries before she recovered her memories. Perhaps the Lamp of Clarity can reveal why.
{{103224356-0-64390:}}I should watch the memory I revealed using the Echonir.
{{103224356-0-64399:}}Beragon told me that Tribune Alea went to Feldagard Keep to warn them about the imminent attack we learned about at Hoperoot. I should go help her, and then return to check in with Beragon.
{{103224356-0-64398:}}Beragon told me Leramil the Wise requested my help at a place called the Outcast Inn. I should investigate, and then return to Skingrad to check in with Beragon.
{{103224356-0-64630:}}Ulfsild's echo mentioned something called the True-Sight Lens, which should be awaiting me in the library's east wing. I should search for it.
{{103224356-0-64632:}}I've read the Fable of the Indrik. Now the Crow wants me to look through Lens of True-Sight at a focal point.
{{103224356-0-63626:}}I should find Leramil the Wise in the city of Skingrad and talk to her.
{{103224356-0-63624:}}The influence of Ithelia, Daedric Prince of Paths, appears to be causing strange disturbances throughout West Weald. Leramil pinpointed three specific sites I should investigate: Ostumir, Rustwall, and Elenglynn.
{{103224356-0-63625:}}Leramil told me to rendezvous at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad to share information with the retired adventurer turned scribe.
{{103224356-0-63628:}}We made our way to the Mythos, the most ancient section of Apocrypha. Now we need to make our way to Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum and aid him against Ithelia's assault.
{{103224356-0-63629:}}In following Ithelia's trail, I came across the residual energy of a memory. I should use the Echonir to reveal it.
{{103224356-0-64403:}}We found Lord Gallio Valente's laboratory. I should speak to Fennorian about our next steps.
{{103224356-0-63421:}}The note found on Uriel's imposter was written by Chef Edric and reveals Pelena's involvement in Uriel's death. Now that Betu has recovered Mizzik suggests we follow him in the hopes that he can track Pelena.
{{103224356-0-63422:}}I tracked <<1>> into the tunnels below the manor. I should apprehend her before she escapes.
{{103224356-0-63423:}}I  stopped  <<1>> from murdering any more victims. I should talk to <<2>> about our next steps.
{{103224356-0-63424:}}<<1>> brought me a piece of treasure. I should examine it to see if it holds any clues.
{{103224356-0-63425:}}I found what appears to be Lady Weatherleah's missing fortune. I should investigate the area.
{{103224356-0-63426:}}I found a letter from <<1>> revealing her suspicions about <<2>>. She intended to leave the estate to her staff and dog, <<3>>. I should bring these findings to her niece, <<4>>.
{{103224356-0-63427:}}I should show <<1>> the letter from <<2>> I discovered alongside the missing fortune.
{{103224356-0-63392:}}The counteragent is currently distilling. I need to wait for Fennorian to finish preparing it for use on the victims of Lord Gallio Valente.
{{103224356-0-63393:}}Fennorian made a counteragent to help the victims of Lord Gallio Valente's experiments. I should pour it on on them.
{{103224356-0-63390:}}Fennorian believes he can brew a counteragent to reverse the effects of Gallio's experiments. I need to find waxflower petals, Imperial oak tannins, and grape pulp for him in the winery.
{{103224356-0-63391:}}I found the ingredients Fennorian asked for. I should return to him so he can craft the alchemical counteragent to save the captives we found.
{{103224356-0-63397:}}Fennorian and I destroyed Lord Gallio Valente's laboratory and the mushroom crop responsible for cultivating the grapes used to create Vesper Valente wine. We should leave the winery and meet outside.
{{103224356-0-63394:}}Fennorian's alchemical counteragent worked. I should speak to one of the victims to learn more about what happened to them.
{{103224356-0-63395:}}The alchemical laboratory should be in the caverns through the doors to the south of where we helped the caged victims. I should head in and find the laboratory.
{{103224356-0-66271:}}I can find my final challenger in the city of Skingrad, in West Weald. Alternatively, I could return to Kishka in Gonfalon Bay for a lesser prize.
{{103224356-0-63987:}}After I picked up the lamp, glowing lights appeared on one side of the chamber. Ithelia said there's a path that wants to be explored and suggested I shine the lamp on it. I should use the lamp's light and see what happens.
{{103224356-0-63986:}}Ithelia feels disgust and hatred for the lamp in a way she doesn't understand. She asked that I pick up the lamp for her. I should take the lamp so we can examine it.
{{103224356-0-63985:}}Ithelia followed me into the cellar and we watched as a strange lamp appeared in front of us. I should talk to Ithelia to find out why she doesn't like this lamp.
{{103224356-0-63984:}}I went down into the cellar beneath the inn. It connects to some old ruins. I should look around for the sugar that Innkeeper Brynmir requested.
{{103224356-0-63980:}}The innkeeper thinks he can make some substitutions for the traditional Sage's Dream ingredients. He asked that I find some sugar from the supplies in the cellar. I should head down there now.
{{103224356-0-63989:}}Ithelia says we entered the Many Paths. I should explore this path and see where it leads.
{{103224356-0-63988:}}Shining the lamp's light on the anchor produced a portal. Ithelia tells me it's a door to another reality. She called it the Many Paths. I should go through the portal and see where it leads.
{{103224356-0-64743:}}Pim said that one of the Bitterfish camps was nearby. That's where we should start our investigation into what has the Goblins so up in arms.
{{103224356-0-64749:}}Before we depart for Apocrypha, Leramil suggested I retrieve the Daedric relics—Abolisher, the Lamp of Clarity, the Skein of Secrets, and the Mirror of Truth.
{{103224356-0-63215:}}We found a letter from someone named Gaius that warns of danger to Rustwall Estate. It says that the staff would hide in nearby catacombs, and he has the key. I should talk to Tribune Alea about this information.
{{103224356-0-63213:}}I found evidence of a fight in the manor house. We also discovered a letter saying that cohort Captain Leronus had a plan to hide the remaining soldiers and staff. Tribune Alea ran off to the barracks to find the captain. I should go join her.
{{103224356-0-64020:}}The Lamp of Clarity helped Beragon escape whatever reality Vargas trapped him in. I should talk to him about where he's been.
{{103224356-0-65170:}}Another obstacle in our path as we see increasing evidence of Ithelia's realm-altering power. Leramil suggests I use the Lamp of Clarity and see what it reveals.
{{103224356-0-65172:}}Once again the path forward is blocked. I should use the Lamp of Clarity to find a way to continue.
{{103224356-0-65173:}}The Mythos changes and warps as Ithelia's hold on Apocrypha strengthens. I must reach Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum and find a way to stop the Forgotten Prince.
{{103224356-0-65174:}}Legionary Caepio asked me to go to Beragon's townhouse and see how I can help him continue his investigation of the Recollection.
{{103224356-0-64880:}}I need to find a Mirrormoor incursion and join forces with other adventurers to fight off the attacking Daedra. If I defeat the incursion leader, I can repel the attack.
{{103224356-0-64885:}}I met Bella Vestum. She asked me to find a Goblin researcher called Pim who's looking into the aggressive Goblins.
{{103224356-0-64229:}}Betu the dog has been poisoned! Otho seems to have an idea of how to help Betu. I should speak to him.
{{103224356-0-63462:}}Leramil opened a portal to Apocrypha. I should enter the portal and travel to the realm of Hermaeus Mora.
{{103224356-0-65377:}}The Fox and I are supposed to steal powerful magic called creatia from three Daedric Princes. I should seek out the Fox at Dawnbreak in Auridon, Rootwater Grove in Greenshade, and Faldar's Tooth in the Rift.
{{103224356-0-65372:}}It sounds like the Gryphon resented the loss of the Scholarium. I should talk to Nahlia to get some more context and see what our next move might be.
{{103224356-0-64546:}}As I entered the large shrine room, I could see an enraged Ithelia in the background. A Daedra that I recognize from the first path approached and asked to speak. I should talk to him and find out what's going on.
{{103224356-0-64547:}}Maerenah suggests we destroy the bloodfiend dens where Balandrus is assembling his army before we deal with the Terror himself.
{{103224356-0-64548:}}We destroyed the weapon caches and collapsed the bloodfiend dens. Now I should speak to Maerenah about how we deal with Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald.
{{103224356-0-64549:}}We need to find Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald, and end his reign of terror.
{{103224356-0-64938:}}I spoke with Nahlia and the Crow. Nahlia seems to recall a hidden detail in the Mizbi fable and the Crow suggested I follow in Ulfsild's footsteps to discover how she overcame this trial.
{{103224356-0-64920:}}With the second key fragment collected, I continue my journey for more Dragon wards. I should use the fable as a reference to see where to search next.
{{103224356-0-64921:}}The wards are dispelled and the third key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-64922:}}I collected the fragments and formed the key to the Dragon's door. To enter the Wing of the Dragon, I should make for the final location indicated in Ulfsild's annotations.
{{103224356-0-64923:}}I found the secret door to the Wing of the Dragon. I should enter and speak to the Dragon Luminary. As I do, I should keep in mind what Ulfsild told me about how to answer the Dragon's questions.
{{103224356-0-64924:}}The Dragon has asked that I place the Fable on a dais near a door. This will connect the path from its wing back to the Scholarium once more.
{{103224356-0-64925:}}The Wing of the Dragon is connected back to the Scholarium. I should speak to the Dragon again to learn what comes next.
{{103224356-0-64926:}}To prove my worth, the Dragon has presented me a number of riddle challenges. I need to complete three from the list. I can decide which tasks to take on. I can also ask my allies in the Scholarium for help.
{{103224356-0-64675:}}I've agreed to become Felande's newest tenant. I should speak to her to finalize the deal.
{{103224356-0-65032:}}I learned that Marcan Caelum captured Valenia while we were searching the ruins of the vineyard. Hooke thinks he took her to the cellars. We have to find them!
{{103224356-0-64939:}}Nahlia thinks Ulfsild laid the groundwork for an unsolveable riddle we can present to the Dragon. I should enter the Dragon's Wing and present my riddle: "Am I Ulfsild's inheritor?
{{103224356-0-65714:}}I informed Leramil that the threat hanging over the inn came from Ithelia herself. However, it's now over. I should hand her the Lamp of Clarity and find out about my reward.
{{103224356-0-65715:}}Ithelia gained control of her powers thanks to the Sage's Dream. She dismissed the shadowy echoes and removed the tangle of fate from the inn. Then she disappeared. I should go tell Leramil what occurred here.
{{103224356-0-65712:}}The Dragon deemed my riddle worthy, and agreed I had completed her trial! I need to claim her sigil as reward.
{{103224356-0-63713:}}I halted the ritual by gathering the ritual items and burning the corrupted corpses. Priest Faric asked me to meet him outside the ruins.
{{103224356-0-63711:}}I need to enter Nonungalo to stop the necrotic ritual by removing the ritual items from the ruins and burning the bodies fueling the spell. The dead necromancer outside the ruins left behind a journal which may hold some clues.
{{103224356-0-63227:}}Tribune Alea and I entered the Rustwall gardens. I should look for the statue where Gauis hid the key.
{{103224356-0-65031:}}With Hooke's help, I found the entrance to the cellars below Caelum Vineyard. I should go in and find Marcan Caelum.
{{103224356-0-65030:}}Hooke believes Marcan is hiding in the abandoned cellars below the ruins of Caelum Vineyard. We need to find the cellar entrance.
{{103224356-0-65033:}}The door to the cellars is locked. I should search for anything that might help while Big Urm batters down the door.
{{103224356-0-65233:}}The Crow advised me to search for Ulfsild's notes in the east wing of the Scholarium.
{{103224356-0-65231:}}Ulfsild's notes at Sunnamere led us to the distant ruin of Paragon's Remembrance. I should seek out her final set of notes on the Dragon's trial.
{{103224356-0-65230:}}Ulfsild's notes led us back to Sunnamere, which once belonged to Ulfsild. I should search for a focal point to find the next hidden piece of the puzzle.
{{103224356-0-65237:}}I found Trapper Marcien tangled in their own net, swarmed by hungry guzzards. I should take the guzzard bait off Marcien.
{{103224356-0-65236:}}I followed  leads from Nahlia and the Crow and learned more about how Ulfsild developed a riddle that stumped the Dragon. I should speak to Nahlia to decide my way forward.
{{103224356-0-65234:}}Nahlia opened a portal to Dov-Vahl Shrine, where Ulfsild hid a series of notes on crafting a riddle for the Dragon. I should search for a focal point to find these notes.
{{103224356-0-65238:}}I found a false book with a message from Ulfsild that unlocked an echo she had hidden away.
{{103224356-0-65589:}}I found Tribune Alea trapped just beyond a mirror like Beragon was. I should use the Lamp of Clarity to lead her back to our reality.
{{103224356-0-65585:}}Nahlia made a portal for us to return to the Scholarium. I should return to the Altar of Scribing and place the key to unlock the altar's full potential.
{{103224356-0-65584:}}Nahlia and I witnessed Ulfsild's final message and retrieved the final key to the altar. I should speak to Nahlia.
{{103224356-0-65586:}}I've placed the key and restored the Altar of Scribing to its full potential. I should speak to Nahlia about what comes next.
{{103224356-0-65581:}}Beragon was trapped in an alternate reality of the Many Paths. He thinks we need to continue exploring this maze of mirrors to find a way out.
{{103224356-0-65580:}}The Lamp revealed a path through the walls. I should follow it and find a way to escape the prison.
{{103224356-0-65583:}}I should take the key to the Scholarium to use at the Scribing altar.
{{103224356-0-65582:}}The final key to the altar is with Ulfsild at her final resting place. I should enter the portal that Nahlia made.
{{103224356-0-63329:}}I should ask <<1>> how I go about signing up for one of these daily jobs.
{{103224356-0-63328:}}I ignited all four signal fires in Varen's Watch. I should leave through the gate and talk to Captain Abitius.
{{103224356-0-63322:}}The imposter Uriel has been murdered. I should investigate his body.
{{103224356-0-63321:}}<<1>> thinks <<2>> meant to confront <<3>> about the letters during tea before she was poisoned. <<3>> was present for her death and aware that Uriel is deceased. I heard a scream downstairs! I should investigate.
{{103224356-0-63320:}}I found letters revealing correspondence between <<1>> and an assassin named <<2>>. It suggests they conspired to murder <<3>>. I should show this to <<4>>.
{{103224356-0-63325:}}I need to search the pantry for the remedy that might help Betu recover.
{{103224356-0-63756:}}Beragon told me he recognized the name Ithelia and Nantharion mentioned: Miscarcand. However, the ancient city has been lost for ages. I should use the Skein of Secrets to locate our foes.
{{103224356-0-63193:}}Everything has been placed in the ritual circle. The next step is to assist Leramil with the ritual.
{{103224356-0-64215:}}I arrived at the Stonechip Gambling Den but Constable Yabren isn't here. Ghrakug called out to me, however. I should hear what he has to say.
{{103224356-0-63239:}}We reached the statue that Gaius marked on his map. I don't see an obvious place where he could've hid the key. I should search the statue for a hiding place.
{{103224356-0-65794:}}I found Ithelia waiting for me at her seat by the fire. I should give her the Sage's Dream so she can regain control of her powers and stop endangering the inn.
{{103224356-0-63798:}}Shardmarshal Vargas appeared while I was observing the memory and trapped me inside! I need to find a way out.
{{103224356-0-63799:}}I found a portal that might lead me out of this memory, but it's closed. Maybe I can use Abolisher to open it again?
{{103224356-0-65057:}}The way forward appears blocked, but Leramil suggests I use the Lamp of Clarity and see what it reveals.
{{103224356-0-63441:}}I gathered tharriker claws, fangs, feathers, and eggshells from Fyrelight Cave. Now to bring them to Commandant Salerius so the Legion can study them.
{{103224356-0-64850:}}I need to find a Mirrormoor incursion and join forces with other adventurers to fight off the attacking Daedra. If I defeat the incursion leader, I can repel the attack.
{{103224356-0-65610:}}Hooke said he has a plan to to save Valenia from Marcan's grasp. I should speak with him.
{{103224356-0-65615:}}Hooke was able to save Valenia while I distracted Marcan Caelum, but Valenia was seriously injured. I should speak with Hooke.
{{103224356-0-65616:}}Valenia died at Marcan Caelum's hands before we could save her, but the rest of the Scarlets survived. I should speak with Hooke.
{{103224356-0-65463:}}I gathered the second fragment of the Gryphon's key, and the Fox appeared again. I should see what it wants.
{{103224356-0-65460:}}Belienne's final facet turned a woman into a pig. I should speak with Belienne to help her decide what to do now.
{{103224356-0-65464:}}The Fox dropped a page from the Fable of the Gryphon by a "large cat" near the canal in Riften. I should find it and claim it.
{{103224356-0-65465:}}Scruut suggested I gather the Daedric relics from Beragon's townhouse. Even though they have been depleted of energy, she says Hermaeus Mora has foreseen that I will need them.
{{103224356-0-64733:}}I need to head to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and see how Leramil wants to resume the hunt for Ithelia, the Prince of Paths.
{{103224356-0-63178:}}I recovered the crates of Blue Aedral along with a note detailing the plot to ambush Orissa's caravan. I should meet her outside and share what I discovered.
{{103224356-0-64055:}}<<1>> is suspicious of the note. The facts in the note do not line up—<<2>> was not working the day <<3>> died and, with the discovery of the memorial, the visiting Uriel Weatherleah may be an imposter. Mizzik thinks we should speak to him.
{{103224356-0-65390:}}Torvesard appeared and wants to speak with me. I should see what he has to say.
{{103224356-0-65391:}}Torvesard appeared and wants to speak with me. I should see what he has to say.
{{103224356-0-65392:}}Torvesard appeared and wants to speak with me. I should see what he has to say.
{{103224356-0-64584:}}I repaired the altar and scribed something called a Grimoire. I should speak to the Crow to understand what just happened.
{{103224356-0-64585:}}The Crow wants me to continue on a journey to learn more about Scribing, but encouraged me to speak to Votary Nahlia first.
{{103224356-0-64582:}}I found a new focusing crystal for the altar. I should approach the altar and follow the Crow's instructions on what to do next.
{{103224356-0-64583:}}The altar's crystal has been replaced, but one last step remains. I'll need to follow the Crow's instructions carefully.
{{103224356-0-64580:}}A talking crow accused Votary Nahlia of causing this magical disturbance. I should speak to the Crow.
{{103224356-0-65349:}}With the second key fragment collected, I continue my journey for more Gryphon wards. I should use the fable as a reference to see where to search next.
{{103224356-0-65345:}}With the first key fragment collected, I continue my journey for more Gryphon wards. I should use the fable as a reference to see where to search next.
{{103224356-0-64581:}}The Crow has a plan to fix the altar. I need to find a new focusing crystal in the east wing of the Scholarium.
{{103224356-0-65699:}}I returned to Skingrad. Beragon wants to have a word with me. I should speak to him.
{{103224356-0-65698:}}I should talk to Fennorian and make sure we accomplished everything we set out to do at the Valente Vineyards and Winery.
{{103224356-0-63693:}}Maerenah wants to follow Grivier's trail and see if he can point us to where Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald, is hiding.
{{103224356-0-63692:}}Now that I have the key, I should open the bank vault and see what's waiting inside.
{{103224356-0-63691:}}Maerenah and I found survivors inside the bank vault. I should speak to Rosalyn, one of the survivors, to find out more.
{{103224356-0-63690:}}Maerenah's friend Tham left a note pointing to possible survivors hiding from vampires in the town's bank vault. We should head there and see what we can find.
{{103224356-0-63697:}}Maerenah and I found Grivier bound in the stables. I should speak to him.
{{103224356-0-63696:}}Maerenah and I need to go to the stables to find Grivier and see if he's still alive.
{{103224356-0-63695:}}Maerenah and I learned that Grivier made a deal with the Terror of the Weald to betray the townsfolk to save his own family. I should talk to Maerenah and see how she wants to proceed.
{{103224356-0-63694:}}Maerenah and I followed Grivier's trail, but all we found were some dead bloodfiends and a scrap of paper. I should examine the paper and see if it's pertinent.
{{103224356-0-63699:}}In addition to killing Balandrus, Maerenah thinks we should destroy his stockpile of weapons. To do that, we need to find something explosive in Rosalyn's alchemy shop.
{{103224356-0-63698:}}Grivier thinks that Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald, is gathering an army in the mine and stockpiling weapons around town. I should talk to Maerenah about how she wants to proceed.
{{103224356-0-63037:}}<<1>> was petrified by the trap protecting the Emblem. With luck, it should be temporary. I should take the Emblem to Narsis Dren's assistant, Elfbetta, at her southern camp.
{{103224356-0-63036:}}I should talk to Beragon and give him the wildburn seed I recovered from the ruins.
{{103224356-0-63035:}}I informed Leramil that the threat hanging over the inn came from Ithelia herself. However, it's now over. I should hand her the Lamp of Clarity and find out about my reward.
{{103224356-0-63034:}}Leramil sent me here to investigate and I wound up working with Tribune Alea to close a Daedric portal and foil an invasion of Skingrad. I should talk to Tribune Alea and make sure the threat here has been contained.
{{103224356-0-63033:}}I should talk to Mizzik now that we solved the murders and found the missing Weatherleah Estate fortune.
{{103224356-0-63031:}}We carried out the Rite of Propagation and the village is celebrating. I should check in with Laeni to see how the couple is doing.
{{103224356-0-63039:}}I helped Fennorian rescue victims from the winery at Valente Vineyards and destroyed the alchemical laboratory of Lord Gallio Valente. I should talk to Fennorian about my reward.
{{103224356-0-64956:}}<<1>> brought me to the altar. He has something to say about the items we found and how they can be used at the altar.
{{103224356-0-65550:}}At the townhouse, I met with my allies and spoke to the leaders of Skingrad and Vashabar. Now I should talk to Beragon about all we accomplished in West Weald.
{{103224356-0-65551:}}Now that the relics have been stored safely, I should talk to Beragon.
{{103224356-0-63657:}}The Mirror of Truth granted Ithelia a moment of clarity, a chance to reflect on her actions. I should speak with her and convince her to stand down before reality becomes too damaged to restore.
{{103224356-0-63655:}}Ithelia and Torvesard have incapacitated Hermaeus Mora. I need to find a way to stop Ithelia before it's too late to preserve reality.
{{103224356-0-63654:}}Now that we made it into Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum, we need to find Ithelia.
{{103224356-0-63659:}}I convinced Ithelia to stand down but Torvesard refuses to listen to reason. He wants to finish what he and Ithelia started. I need to see what happens.
{{103224356-0-65042:}}I distracted the killer, but Marcan decided to set the cellar on fire and meet the same fate as his wife and child. I need to find a way out of the cellar.
{{103224356-0-63240:}}Now that we have the catacombs key, I should unlock the catacombs and search for the missing legionaries and estate staff.
{{103224356-0-63241:}}We entered the catacombs, but haven't found any legionaries or estate staff. Tribune Alea wants us to push forward anyway. I should search the catacombs for signs of survivors.
{{103224356-0-63246:}}We found the Daedric portal. I need to destroy the portal anchors to close the portal and keep more Daedra from flooding in.
{{103224356-0-64279:}}I found Agawen Ciiril. I need to ask her if she can gather supplies for the couple.
{{103224356-0-64270:}}After Shardmarshal Vargas opened another portal, Tribune Alea impulsively attacked her. This wasn't the plan. I should try to get to Tribune Alea and help her.
{{103224356-0-64271:}}Tribune Alea attacked Shardmarshal Vargas before we could execute the plan. They fell into the portal created by the blade. The last thing I heard was Tribune Alea telling me to follow her. I should go through the portal and find them both.
{{103224356-0-64272:}}Tribune Alea Idolus and I defeated the Shardborn. Shardmarshal Vargas retreated and left her sword behind. She called it Abolisher. I should take the magical blade.
{{103224356-0-64274:}}Now that I have Abolisher, I should try to open a portal the way we saw Shardmarshal Vargas do it. If I slash the blade through the air, maybe I can create a portal back to the keep.
{{103224356-0-64275:}}I mimicked Shardmarshal Vargas and used Abolisher to open a portal. I should step through and hope it returns us to Feldagard Keep.
{{103224356-0-64276:}}The portal returned us to Feldagard Keep. I should talk to Commander Merian to update him on what happened beneath the keep and with Shardmarshal Vargas.
{{103224356-0-64277:}}Laeni asked me to speak to her Aunt Ciiril. Ciiril might be willing to help the couple start a new life away from Vashabar. I should be able to find her at the beer garden in the village.
{{103224356-0-65068:}}The arcane knot isn't stable outside of the null arca. The faster I can get the knot to the null arca, the better.
{{103224356-0-65069:}}I made it out of the citadel and placed the arcane knot into the null arca. I should talk to Keshargo now.
{{103224356-0-65066:}}I gathered Versidue from the trapper's snare. I should finish the job and return it to Star-Gazer Sariyaah for payment.
{{103224356-0-65067:}}I found Trapper Marcien. I should report my findings to Sariyaah in Ontus.
{{103224356-0-65064:}}I gathered the adolescent guzzard from the trap. I should finish the job and bring it to <<1>> for payment.
{{103224356-0-65065:}}I gathered the old guzzard from Marcien's trap. I should finish the job and bring it to <<1>> for payment.
{{103224356-0-63796:}}We need to continue searching Miscarcand for King Nantharion or the ruined city's Ayleid well.
{{103224356-0-63797:}}I found a lingering memory within Miscarcand. I should use the Echonir to see what it reveals.
{{103224356-0-63794:}}The passage ahead is blocked by rubble. I should try to use Abolisher to create a portal.
{{103224356-0-63795:}}I used Abolisher to open a portal past the blocked passage. I should go on through.
{{103224356-0-63792:}}Beragon and I entered the lost city of Miscarcand. We need to catch up with Tribune Alea and find King Nantharion or the Ayleid well he's looking for.
{{103224356-0-63793:}}We caught up to Tribune Alea in Miscarcand. I should talk to her.
{{103224356-0-63790:}}I met Beragon and a wounded legionary outside the door to an Ayleid ruin. I should talk to Beragon about what happened here.
{{103224356-0-63791:}}It appears that Ithelia and King Nantharion opened a long-lost door to Miscarcand. I need to follow them inside and stop them from awakening the ancient city's Ayleid well.
{{103224356-0-65268:}}The wards are dispelled and the second key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-65269:}}With the second key fragment collected, I continue my journey for more Netch wards. I should use the fable as a reference to see where to search next.
{{103224356-0-65264:}}The wards are dispelled and the first key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-65265:}}With the first key fragment collected, I continue my journey for more Netch wards. I should use the fable as a reference to see where to search next.
{{103224356-0-63950:}}Solving the tile puzzle disabled the magic surrounding the Emblem of the Last King. <<1>> wants to take it. I should probably keep him out of trouble.
{{103224356-0-63951:}}<<1>> wants to take the Emblem of the Last King, but there seems to be one final trap that he hasn't caught on to. I could warn him or just see what happens.
{{103224356-0-63952:}}I disarmed the final trap protecting the Emblem of the Last King. I should take the Emblem and bring it to Elfbetta, Narsis Dren's assistant, at her southern camp.
{{103224356-0-63953:}}<<1>> was petrified by the trap. I can use a nearby switch to disarm the mechanism and recover the Emblem without meeting a similar fate.
{{103224356-0-63954:}}I warned <<1>> before he triggered the trap, but he disregarded me. I should use that a nearby switch to disarm the trap before grasping the Emblem, so that I don't meet a similar fate.
{{103224356-0-63955:}}Beragon said to listen for calls for help as we search Ostumir for survivors. He asked that we keep a look out for his friend, Greenspeaker Sorilen, as well. I should search for any survivors I can aid.
{{103224356-0-63959:}}We arrived at the ruins but Greenspeaker Sorilen is nowhere to be seen. Beragon pointed out a dead body wearing the gear of the Recollection. I should examine the note lying next to the body.
{{103224356-0-65705:}}We recovered a fragment of the titan, but Trovesard appeared and used a reality tear to attack me. Curate Gadayn saved me, but was consumed by the tear. I need to take the fragment back to Beragon's townhouse and let Leramil know what happened.
{{103224356-0-65703:}}I found Ulfsild's notes at Dov-Vahl Shrine. I should share what I found with Nahlia.
{{103224356-0-63702:}}We need to locate and destroy the weapon stockpiles that the vampire gang have placed around the town.
{{103224356-0-65923:}}I need to enter the Archival Wings.
{{103224356-0-65761:}}Pim said she knows what Jerntann is doing. I should talk to her.
{{103224356-0-64330:}}This farmstead looks abandoned. I should look around for clues about what happened here.
{{103224356-0-64333:}}I should look at the Skein of Secrets. It may have new clues about King Nantharion's location.
{{103224356-0-64332:}}I found a note beside a dead farmer. The Recollection seemed to be interested in the nearby old well. I should investigate.
{{103224356-0-63645:}}Toutis is going to show me how to retrieve Aetherial shards using the Aetherial alarum. I should find a shard for his demonstration.
{{103224356-0-63647:}}I should look for Amuarel before I leave Fyrelight Cave, to see if she has anything she wants me to relay to Grander.
{{103224356-0-63640:}}Toutis said I should use the Aetherial Alarum near the Aetherial shard, then pay attention to the surrounding pylons to identify a pattern.
{{103224356-0-64162:}}Inside the Ontus Reservoir, Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee are issuing orders and I see Constable Yabren bound nearby. I should set her free.
{{103224356-0-64685:}}I helped Legionary Calvo Dorso reach the bell tower and signal for reinforcements. Now I should talk to Captain Dromius about my reward.
{{103224356-0-64687:}}We found the groundskeeper hiding in his residence. I should ask him about the key to the catacombs and what happened here.
{{103224356-0-64686:}}We found more evidence that fatigue fever is being created here in this alchemical laboratory. We also found a letter ordering the alchemist to eliminate me and Ghrakug! While Yabren goes to warn him, I need to destroy this alchemical equipment.
{{103224356-0-64683:}}Leramil's portal led somewhere she did not intend. I should look around.
{{103224356-0-64682:}}<<1>>  instructed me to place all three items on top of the Altar so we can choose the correct one to offer.
{{103224356-0-64577:}}Votary Nahlia ordered me to seal the doors in the library while she tries to stabilize the magic arcing off the altar.
{{103224356-0-65453:}}Belienne thinks the facet of her fear is hiding somewhere. She suggested I look for her fear in a ruin or cave to the southwest of Ontus.
{{103224356-0-65452:}}Belienne's delight and I passed out after drinking the West Weald Wallop. Belienne reclaimed her delight while we were unconscious. I should speak with her to see what she wants me to do next.
{{103224356-0-65457:}}Belienne thinks her final facet is her vanity. It's somewhere in Dawnwood, and Belienne is worried it may cause trouble for the Wood Elves. I should meet her in Vashabar to capture the facet of her vanity.
{{103224356-0-65456:}}I calmed Belienne's fear and convinced her to return. I should speak with Belienne and learn which facet is still missing.
{{103224356-0-65455:}}Belienne's fear is trapped in a spiderweb. I should rescue her.
{{103224356-0-65454:}}Belienne's fear is terrified of me. She ran deeper into the ruins. I should follow her to make sure she doesn't get hurt.
{{103224356-0-65459:}}Belienne asked me to speak with her facet to understand what happened.
{{103224356-0-65458:}}I found Belienne being accused of a crime she didn't commit. I should speak with her to learn more about the situation.
{{103224356-0-63859:}}Beragon believes that we need to find Ithelia, who may have returned to her long-lost Oblivion plane, Mirrormoor. Perhaps the Skein of Secrets can help us find a way there.
{{103224356-0-63857:}}Legionary Caepio told me that Beragon, Tribune Alea, and Leramil are waiting for me at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad. I should go see what they need.
{{103224356-0-64499:}}<<1>> instructed me to read the epitaph he has found. He thinks it holds a clue to solving the nearby tile puzzle and releasing the Emblem.
{{103224356-0-65358:}}The Gryphon wants me to complete a few safeguard challenges to prove my commitment. I should review the challenges he's set out.
{{103224356-0-65359:}}To prove my worth, the Gryphon has presented me a number of safeguard challenges. I need to complete three from the list. I can decide which tasks I wish to take on to prove myself worthy of the Luminary's power.
{{103224356-0-65356:}}The Gryphon has asked that I place the Fable on a dais near a door. This will connect the path from his wing back to the Scholarium once more.
{{103224356-0-65357:}}The Wing of the Gryphon is connected back to the Scholarium. I should speak to the Gryphon again to learn what comes next.
{{103224356-0-65640:}}I acquired a cask of West Weald Wallop. I should pour a round for myself and Belienne's delight.
{{103224356-0-64769:}}After investigating the Sharp Tooth camp, Pim and I heard a voice cry out for help. Pim thinks it's Bella and asked me to help.
{{103224356-0-65311:}}Nahlia found me in Suran, apparently after a briefing from the Netch. I should speak to her.
{{103224356-0-65312:}}I need to find and speak to the dying man's son at the clinic in Suran, on the isle of Vvardenfell.
{{103224356-0-65313:}}Nahlia put a magical ink on Elic's father, which connected her to the fragments of the dying man. Working with the Netch, she will open portals that will lead me to the fragments of the man's soul.
{{103224356-0-64909:}}Nahlia saw me pick up the Fable of the Dragon and came over to chat. I should see what she wants to talk about.
{{103224356-0-65296:}}I found and spoke with three fragments of the dying man's soul and urged them back to Suran. I should speak to Elic to see how things are going.
{{103224356-0-64658:}}The Indrik has asked me to track down a fawn chased by a hunter, trapped in a wisp of its power. The Luminary told me that the southern Auridon cave called Del's Claim would be the place to pick up the trail.
{{103224356-0-64659:}}I've found the indrik fawn. The Indrik has asked me to dispel its power from the beast, releasing it from this burden placed upon it.
{{103224356-0-64656:}}To prove my worth, the Indrik has presented me a number of challenges. I need to complete two from the list. I can decide which tasks I wish to take on and prove myself worthy of the Luminary's power.
{{103224356-0-64657:}}I've completed the challenges set out by the Indrik. Time to return to the Luminary and see what comes next.
{{103224356-0-64654:}}The Wing of the Indrik is connected back to the Scholarium. I should speak to the Indrik again to learn what comes next.
{{103224356-0-64652:}}The door to the Wing of the Indrik has been revealed. Now to head inside and meet my first Luminary face to face.
{{103224356-0-64653:}}The Indrik has asked that I place the Fable on a dais near a door. This will connect the path from his wing back to the Scholarium once more.
{{103224356-0-64650:}}I collected the fragments and formed the key to the Indrik's door. To enter the Wing of the Indrik, I should make for the final location indicated in Ulfsild's annotations.
{{103224356-0-63928:}}Scruut opened a portal to the instability she wants us to investigate. I should enter the portal and see where it leads.
{{103224356-0-65157:}}I should gather the adolescent guzzard from the trap and bring it to <<1>>.
{{103224356-0-65484:}}Ithelia has entered the portal and walked the Many Paths to the reality of her exile. Now I should use Abolisher and destroy the portal, assuring she can never return to our reality.
{{103224356-0-63888:}}<<1>> seeks to recover his lost notes, as well as information from the Recollection on what they've found so far. We should search the area for these items.
{{103224356-0-63886:}}According to <<1>> I will find Narsis Dren skulking around the local ruins. I should look for him there.
{{103224356-0-63884:}}I defeated Shardmarshal Vargas and destroyed the Loom of the Untraveled Road. Now that West Weald and reality itself are safe, I should leave this place.
{{103224356-0-63882:}}To reach the Loom, it appears I first need to go through Shardmarshal Vargas. I need to defeat her if I'm going to have a chance of destroying the Loom and stopping Ithelia from changing history and destroying this reality.
{{103224356-0-63883:}}Shardmarshal Vargas has fallen. Now I need to use Abolisher and destroy the Loom of the Untraveled Road.
{{103224356-0-63880:}}I used Abolisher to create a portal out of Ithelia's prison. We should continue through the portal.
{{103224356-0-63881:}}We escaped from the prison Shardmarshal Vargas trapped us in. Ithelia and her scions are here. We need to reach the Loom's core.
{{103224356-0-65736:}}As a show of favor, the Netch has given me its sigil, a representation of its re-commitment to the Scholarium. I need to gather the sigil if I'm to learn more about Scribing.
{{103224356-0-65737:}}With the Netch's sigil in hand I should return to the Scribing Altar. Infusing the altar with the power of the Netch will enhance my connection with scripts and grimoires around the world.
{{103224356-0-64280:}}Ciiril agreed to help the couple. She gave me some jagga and asked me to speak with Nedolir and Minth. Perhaps the fathers will see reason now that their children plan to leave town. They should be in pod houses near the village center.
{{103224356-0-64283:}}Agawen Ciiril asked that I speak to  <<1>> and <<2>>, family friends. She hopes they might be able to talk the couple into staying. Both should be near the center of the village.
{{103224356-0-64282:}}Nedolir and Minth love their children but strongly oppose a marriage. I should find Agawen Ciiril at the stables to see how she's coming along with the supplies.
{{103224356-0-63778:}}We learned a lot about the Recollection at Hoperoot. We should return to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad to regroup and plan our next move.
{{103224356-0-63779:}}I should talk to Beragon about what we learned at Hoperoot so we can plan our next move.
{{103224356-0-63770:}}Tribune Alea wants to talk to me about the Echonir memory we just observed. I should speak to her.
{{103224356-0-63772:}}We found King Nantharion talking to Greenspeaker Sorilen. They don't realize we're here. I should listen in on their conversation.
{{103224356-0-63773:}}King Nantharion is the leader of the Recollection! He's heading to the throne room with Greenspeaker Sorilen to prepare a new wildburn seed. I need to stop him.
{{103224356-0-63774:}}King Nantharion ordered Greenspeaker Sorilen to prevent me from interfering in his wildburn seed ritual. I need to defeat her.
{{103224356-0-63775:}}I fought my way past Greenspeaker Sorilen. Now I need to destroy the seed before King Nantharion completes his ritual.
{{103224356-0-63776:}}Stopping the ritual unleashed a wildburn eruption right here in Hoperoot. I need to escape!
{{103224356-0-64226:}}I should travel to Fort Colovia and find a way inside.
{{103224356-0-64364:}}The spot marked by the Skein doesn't seem significant, but Leramil arrived and says she senses an anomaly. She suggests I use Abolisher and see what happens.
{{103224356-0-64362:}}Fennorian made a counteragent to help the victims of Lord Gallio Valente's experiments. I should pick it up and pour it on on them.
{{103224356-0-65219:}}Now that I'm inside the manor, I need to find Lord Gallio Valente's office to search for clues regarding the purpose of the wine he's put up for auction.
{{103224356-0-63305:}}I should look around the library and see what I can discover regarding the death of Lady Weatherleah.
{{103224356-0-63304:}}I learned from the family that <<1>> was found by <<2>>. I should ask him what he saw at the crime scene.
{{103224356-0-63307:}}I found some interesting clues in the library that suggest the scene was staged. I should talk about this with <<1>>.
{{103224356-0-63300:}}I found a note behind the painting. I should show it to <<1>>.
{{103224356-0-63303:}}<<1>> fears <<2>> met with the author of the note and fell victim to foul play. But Mizzik was told <<2>> was found dead in her library, alone. Mizzik suggests we speak to the members of the household who were present when she was found.
{{103224356-0-63308:}}The clues I discovered suggest the killer escaped through the window. I should investigate the window exterior.
{{103224356-0-65405:}}I should search for the bear cub, starting at the site of the attack.
{{103224356-0-63806:}}Leramil the Wise appeared in Beragon's townhouse. She wants to speak with me.
{{103224356-0-63804:}}We reached the Well of Miscarcand. King Nantharion is filling the Staff of Many Paths with energy the well. I need to stop him before he fills the staff and unleashes a massive wildburn.
{{103224356-0-63805:}}I defeated King Nantharion, but Shardmarshal Vargas used the power in the staff to fully restore Ithelia's power. I should return to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and discuss the implications with my allies.
{{103224356-0-63802:}}I discovered another lingering memory within Miscarcand. I should use the Echonir to observe it.
{{103224356-0-63803:}}We heard Beragon calling, but there's a locked gate and a rubble-filled passage between us. I should open a portal with Abolisher.
{{103224356-0-63800:}}I used Abolisher to open a new portal. That's my way out of this ancient memory.
{{103224356-0-63801:}}I escaped the memory Shardmarshal Vargas tried to trap me in. I need to continue the search for King Nantharion.
{{103224356-0-63809:}}Leramil told me she believes the Recollection is searching Niryastare for a relic created by the Daedric Prince Mephala. Beragon and I must retrieve it before they do. I should meet him at the ruins.
{{103224356-0-64878:}}I helped defeat a Mirrormoor incursion. I should return to <<1>> to report my success.
{{103224356-0-64874:}}The Netch's power has amplified the altar, and another Wing of the Scholarium has been restored. I should speak with Votary Nahlia.
{{103224356-0-64040:}}I successfully created a Sage's Dream drink. Maybe the first one in thousands of years. I should go upstairs so I can present the drink to Ithelia.
{{103224356-0-65679:}}I should talk to Tribune Alea and figure out what to do with the sword we acquired, Abolisher.
{{103224356-0-65678:}}Now that I made our report to Commander Merian, I should talk to Tribune Alea.
{{103224356-0-65677:}}I should talk to Beragon and give him the wildburn seed I recovered from the ruins.
{{103224356-0-65675:}}With the Indrik's sigil in hand I should return to the Scribing Altar. Infusing the altar with the power of the Indrik will enhance my connection with scripts and grimoires around the world.
{{103224356-0-65674:}}As a show of favor, the Indrik has given me its sigil, a representation of its re-commitment to the Scholarium. I need to gather the sigil if I'm to learn more about Scribing.
{{103224356-0-63631:}}With the wards destroyed, I should now be able to enter Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum.
{{103224356-0-63630:}}The Skein indicates that the Mirrormoor wards are somewhere hidden in the levels above the entrance to the private sanctum. I need to find them and destroy them.
{{103224356-0-63639:}}Toutis is ready to show me how to use the Aetherial alarum. I should speak to him.
{{103224356-0-63433:}}Now that I'm inside Fort Colovia, I need to find and burn crates filled with the misprinted gala invitations.
{{103224356-0-63434:}}I burned the crates of misprinted gala invitations. Now I should return to <<1>> for my reward.
{{103224356-0-63389:}}Fennorian and I discovered some of the servants used in Lord Gallio Valente's experiments. I should speak to Fennorian about what we can do for them.
{{103224356-0-63388:}}I need to search the winery and locate Lord Gallio Valente's alchemical laboratroy.
{{103224356-0-63384:}}I found Lord Gallio Valente's office. I should search around for evidence concerning the true purpose of this auction.
{{103224356-0-63387:}}Fennorian wants to head downstairs to find the alchemical laboratory in the winery. He wants to make sure this is the last batch of Vesper Valente.
{{103224356-0-63386:}}Fennorian found me in Lord Valente's office. I should talk to him and tell him what I uncovered.
{{103224356-0-64317:}}Nedolir called out, asking for an explanation of what's going on. I should speak to him before the Rite begins.
{{103224356-0-64316:}}I need to return to the center of Vashabar and find Ciiril so I can assist Laeni and Clendagal complete the Rite of Propagation.
{{103224356-0-66269:}}I should make my way to Fyrelight Cave.
{{103224356-0-66268:}}As I approached the cave, a man shouted out, apparently in some distress. I should see what happened, perhaps I can help.
{{103224356-0-65054:}}I prepared the barricade to set it on fire. Commander Merian ordered Tribune Alea to get in position as lookout. He wants me to finish repairing the ballista. I should grab the necessary parts to fix the weapon.
{{103224356-0-65058:}}Ithelia's very presence seems to be transforming Apocrypha into Mirrormoor. I need to keep going and reach Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum.
{{103224356-0-64756:}}We arrived at a goblin camp that Pim says belongs to the Bitterfish Tribe. We should look for signs of any struggle or disturbance that would have provoked the Goblins.
{{103224356-0-63194:}}I recovered most of the dowry items, which should please Grander Nemarcet. Although, he might be unhappy to learn that his prospective bride was the brigand who robbed him.
{{103224356-0-63195:}}Toutis gave me a tool called an Aetherial alarum and told me he'll show me how to use it to retrieve the shards once we're inside Silorn. I should lead the way.
{{103224356-0-63196:}}I should seek out the remaining four Aetherial shards in Silorn and gather them to return to Toutis.
{{103224356-0-63197:}}I gathered the five Aetherial shards for Toutis. I should meet him outside Silorn for my reward.
{{103224356-0-63190:}}I need to defeat the Primordial Shattered Titan in order to acquire one its fragments to use to create the relic Scruut told me about.
{{103224356-0-63191:}}With the Primordial Shattered TItan destroyed, I need to gather a fragment of the creature to take back to Leramil and Scruut.
{{103224356-0-65160:}}Beragon wants to warn King Nantharion that he may have a Recollection spy in his midst. I need to rendezvous with Beragon and Tribune Alea near Hoperoot.
{{103224356-0-65368:}}The Fox and I have made off with creatia from three Daedric Princes. I should talk to the Gryphon and pass him my ill-gotten gains.
{{103224356-0-65363:}}I've completed the safeguards set out by the Gryphon. Time to return to the Luminary and see what comes next.
{{103224356-0-64091:}}I disarmed the final trap protecting the Emblem. I should bring it to Elfbetta, Narsis Dren's assistant, at her southern camp.
{{103224356-0-64092:}}Narsis did not heed my warning, but I recovered the Emblem. I should deliver it to Dren's assistant, Elfbetta, at her southern camp.
{{103224356-0-64540:}}Leramil created a portal to help us navigate the Loom. I should enter it and continue exploring.
{{103224356-0-64545:}}I found the Ithelia for this reality. She's kneeling on the floor and looks despondent. I should talk to her and learn what happened to her.
{{103224356-0-65780:}}Scruut has asked that I speak with her.
{{103224356-0-64937:}}I've completed the riddles set out by the Dragon. Time to return to the Luminary and see what comes next.
{{103224356-0-64021:}}I freed Beragon and Tribune Alea with the Lamp of Clarity. Now I need to find a way to escape Ithelia's prison.
{{103224356-0-64784:}}Jerntann is keeping the Goblin tribe's totems somewhere in Gray's Hollow. I have to find them if Pim is going to end this Goblin war.
{{103224356-0-64783:}}Pim said that the hunters are camping out at Gray's Hollow. I should find Pim at Gray's Hollow so we can stop the hunters.
{{103224356-0-63789:}}Beragon believes King Nantharion and Ithelia have discovered the Ayleid ruin of Miscarcand buried beneath Vashabar. We need to get to Vashabar now.
{{103224356-0-63788:}}I concluded my dealings with Hermaeus Mora. Ithelia is now truly a Forgotten Prince once more. I should return to Beragon's celebration.
{{103224356-0-63785:}}I returned to Beragon's townhouse and was greeted by Tribune Alea. She says I need to go out on the balcony and talk to Beragon about some urgent matter.
{{103224356-0-63784:}}The Daedric relics were placed and the spell was cast. The reality tears have been repaired and existence has been preserved. I should now return to Beragon's townhouse and check in with Leramil.
{{103224356-0-65538:}}The Riddle of Luminary Flames will require me to set all the braziers ablaze by carefully choosing which ones to light. I can refer to the riddle for hints
{{103224356-0-65539:}}Nahlia and I solved the Riddle of Luminary Fires. We should continue through the gate to see what comes next.
{{103224356-0-65530:}}I spoke to the two family friends, and one of them suggested I find and speak with <<1>> for another perspective. He's near the center of town.
{{103224356-0-65531:}}Nahlia has agreed to accompany me into the Wing of the Crow. It's time to head inside.
{{103224356-0-65532:}}The first chamber in the Wing of the Crow is a strange space filled with magic and littered with echoes left behind by Ulsfild. I should listen to them to see what they have to say.
{{103224356-0-65533:}}I listened to the three echoes left behind by Ulfsild. I should speak with Nahlia about what I heard.
{{103224356-0-65534:}}The echoes appear to be pointing at a book. Yet another riddle? I should read the book and decipher its puzzle to proceed.
{{103224356-0-65535:}}A door appeared after solving Ulfsild's echo puzzle. I should proceed inside to continue the trial.
{{103224356-0-65536:}}The Crow was waiting for me beyond the door. I should talk to her to see what comes next.
{{103224356-0-65537:}}The Crow told to move forward I'll need to solve a puzzle. I should talk to Nahlia, who loves puzzles, about how to proceed.
{{103224356-0-64664:}}Before we can check the bank vault, Maerenah says we need a key to open the door. She thinks the bank clerk kept a spare vault key in a lockbox by their desk. I should look for it.
{{103224356-0-64661:}}I should speak to Nahlia and catch her up on my adventures.
{{103224356-0-64660:}}The indrik fawn has been freed of the Luminary's power. It's time to return to the wing of the Indrik.
{{103224356-0-64669:}}Rosalyn, one of only two survivors in the vault, told us that her husband, Grivier, has been escorting townsfolk to safety. We should leave the bank and try to find Grivier and the others.
{{103224356-0-64243:}}Tribune Alea Idolus wants to survey the attack before deciding on a plan. She told me of an overlook near the entrance where a marketplace is often held. I should go to the overlook with her.
{{103224356-0-64249:}}Elfbetta asked me to help Narsis Dren recover the Ayleid treasure from the ruins of Wendir. I should talk to him.
{{103224356-0-64248:}}Betu seems to be recovering from the poison thanks to the remedy! I should talk to Mizzik about the note I found with the imposter.
{{103224356-0-63268:}}The scroll marked four locations inside the Watch where the signal fires must be ignited. I should find and ignite them to alert the Legion.
{{103224356-0-64159:}}Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee are issuing orders to their mercenaries. I should hear what they're talking about before I act.
{{103224356-0-64158:}}Before he succumbed to his wounds, Ghrakug told me the mercenaries that attacked him took Constable Yabren to the Ontus reservoir, north of town near the river. I should get there as soon as I can.
{{103224356-0-64153:}}Ghrakug passed along a message from Constable Yabren. She wants me to meet her at Carvain Manor and Lady Raxalee's tower to help her search for evidence pertaining to fatigue fever.
{{103224356-0-64155:}}I reached the location northeast of Ontus known as Zeggar's Blind. I should look around and see what's going on out here.
{{103224356-0-64154:}}Letters and other documents found at Carvain Manor and Raxalee Tower suggest they might be involved in the suspicious deaths associated with fatigue fever. I need to investigate Zeggar's Blind next.
{{103224356-0-64156:}}Now that I destroyed the alchemical equipment used to make the fatigue fever elixir, I should meet Constable Yabren at the Stonechip Gambling Den.
{{103224356-0-65702:}}Nahlia came up to me as I was listening to the Ulfsild's Hidden Echo. She wants to speak with me.
{{103224356-0-64250:}}Beragon figured out the Recollection is interested in the Ayleid ruin of Niryastare and asked me to meet him there. However, Leramil the Wise wants to talk to me before I leave.
{{103224356-0-64256:}}We found Commander Merian leading legionaries in the keep's defense. He warned us about Daedra climbing the walls to get in and asked us to stop them. I should slow their assault by burning the ropes and setting traps.
{{103224356-0-64257:}}I set traps against the Daedric forces and burned the ropes they used to climb into the keep. It appears I slowed their assault. I should find the main courtyard and meet up with Commander Merian.
{{103224356-0-64255:}}Tribune Alea and I made it into Feldagard Keep through the side entrance. She wants us to track down Commander Merian who leads the legionaries here. I should search the keep for the commander.
{{103224356-0-64258:}}Tribune Alea and I found Commander Merian near a broken ballista. He ordered the tribune to start repairs and told me that I get the fun part. I should talk to the commander to find out what that means.
{{103224356-0-64259:}}Commander Merian told me of his plan to hold back the Daedra with a wall of fire while peppering them with ballista bolts. He wants me to help with this plan. First, I should grab a bucket of oil.
{{103224356-0-63700:}}Maerenah wants me to grab alchemical oil and combustion canisters from the alchemy shop. We can combine those to create a simple explosive to destroy the Terror's weapon stockpiles.
{{103224356-0-63705:}}Maerenah suggests we destroy the bloodfiend dens where Balandrus is assembling his army before we deal with the Terror himself.
{{103224356-0-63704:}}Maerenah says it's time to enter the mine on the east side of town and find Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald.
{{103224356-0-63707:}}We defeated Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald. Maerenah saw her friend Tham flee before the battle. We should head outside and try to find him.
{{103224356-0-63706:}}We found Balandrus and his lieutenants. It's time to put an end to their attack on Sutch.
{{103224356-0-64357:}}We need to find Beragon and continue our search for King Nantharion or the ancient Ayleid well.
{{103224356-0-63978:}}Innkeeper Brynmir believes he saw a book of obscure and ancient recipes in the back courtyard. It might contain a recipe for the Sage's Dream drink. I should search the courtyard to find the book.
{{103224356-0-63979:}}I found the book of obscure and ancient recipes in the courtyard's outbuilding. I should head back to Innkeeper Brynmir and show him the recipe for Sage's Dream.
{{103224356-0-63972:}}Unlike Leramil, I was able to cross the barrier created by the tangled threads of fate. I can now enter the Outcast Inn and search for the source of the threat that initiated this disturbance.
{{103224356-0-63973:}}Strange shadowy figures wander inside the Outcast Inn. The innkeeper sounded nervous when he called me over. I should talk to him and find out what's happening.
{{103224356-0-63970:}}Leramil believes we are in Fargrave, a planar crossroads of sorts. We should explore the area.
{{103224356-0-63971:}}Leramil can't get any closer to the inn because of the pain the tangle she perceives inflicts on her heightened senses. I should be able to cross the barrier formed by the tangle and get inside.
{{103224356-0-63976:}}When I returned to the Outcast Inn, the woman asked for help. I should find out what she wants.
{{103224356-0-63977:}}The woman is the Daedric Prince, Ithelia. She lost control of her powers which created the threat around the inn. A name of a drink came to her mind—Sage's Dream. I should ask Innkeeper Brynmir about this drink.
{{103224356-0-63974:}}Innkeeper Brynmir told me the strange events around the inn scared his customers. It all started when the woman by the fire entered the inn. He asked me to get water from the well so he can make her a drink and get her talking.
{{103224356-0-63975:}}I fetched water from the well. I should bring it back to Innkeeper Brynmir so he can make a drink for the woman sitting by the fire.
{{103224356-0-63352:}}I should find Captain Abitius and tell her that I ignited the signal fires at Varen's Watch. The scroll mentioned she had set up a camp nearby.
{{103224356-0-65367:}}The Gryphon wants to protect the Scholarium by enacting a ritual he and Ulfsild designed before the library was taken. The Fox has apparently come up with a plan to gather the magic we need to see this task done.
{{103224356-0-65408:}}To completely destroy Lord Gallio Valente's ability to make more Vesper Valente, we need to set fire to the mushroom planters and burn the mushrooms to cinders.
{{103224356-0-65366:}}I opened the Wing of the Gryphon and amplified the Scribing Altar with the power of the Gryphon. I should speak to Nahlia.
{{103224356-0-65409:}}I should speak with Legionary Luther about what I found
{{103224356-0-63839:}}The Skein of Secrets now shows a new location—Vashabar! I should talk to Beragon about this development.
{{103224356-0-63835:}}I returned to Beragon's townhouse. I should talk to him about what I learned at Hastrel Hollow and Terthil Farm.
{{103224356-0-63780:}}Scruut brought me a plan from Hermaeus Mora to use the Daedric relics created to defeat Ithelia to heal the tears her presence caused in the fabric of reality. I need to take the relics to West Weald, the Telvanni Peninsula, and Apocrypha.
{{103224356-0-63787:}}Hermaeus Mora finished with Leramil and sent her away. I should talk to him now.
{{103224356-0-63786:}}Scruut tells me that Hermaeus Mora wants to talk to me one final time. I should step through the portal she opened.
{{103224356-0-64160:}}Baron Carvain ordered his mercenaries to kill me and dump the barrels of elixir into the reservoir. I need to deal with them before I can catch up with Constable Yabren.
{{103224356-0-64161:}}I stopped the mercenaries. Now to catch up with Constable Yabren and find Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee.
{{103224356-0-64163:}}Looks like Constable Yabren caught Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee. I should talk to her.
{{103224356-0-65348:}}The wards are dispelled and the second key fragment has been revealed.
{{103224356-0-64042:}}Ithelia drank the Sage's Dream and instantly seems better. I should talk to her and find out what she's thinking.
{{205344756-0-8910:}}Legionary Caepio, under orders from Tribune Alea, asked me to assist Beragon with his ongoing investigation into the Recollection's true plans. I agreed to provide my assistance.
{{205344756-0-8906:}}I found a Ghostlight bottle. Keshargo will want to look at this since Xoryn had it.
{{205344756-0-8907:}}I found a piece of Living Glass which could be tied to the arcane knot. I should give it to Keshargo.
{{205344756-0-8836:}}Leramil the Wise sent word that I'm needed in West Weald. The land is threatened by Daedric incursions, a secretive order known as the Recollection, and a forgotten Daedric Prince. Leramil claims that fate has chosen me to meet this challenge.
{{205344756-0-8841:}}It seems I'm needed back at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad. King Nantharion and the Recollection are about to do something terrible, and he needs my help to find and stop them.
{{205344756-0-8896:}}Goblins in West Weald are becoming aggressive. Fearing for their lives, the local farmers want to hire hunters to take care of the Goblins, but others are looking for a way to save the Goblins.
{{205344756-0-8923:}}I came across a job posting for a deputy to assist newly appointed Constable Yabren in the investigation of suspicious deaths in the town of Ontus.
{{205344756-0-8917:}}Legionary Caepio brought word from Tribune Alea. She wants me to meet her at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad so we can share information about the troubles plaguing West Weald.
{{205344756-0-8950:}}I found a note on the road describing the beauty of a place called Fyrelight Cave. It sounds like an interesting place. Might be worth checking out.
{{211899940-0-34406:}}<Akatosh blesses you with his wisdom and vision. For a generous contribution in his name, the Dragon God of Time will grant you the power to revisit your choices regarding Attributes.>
{{211899940-0-34405:}}Stendarr blesses you with his wisdom and vision. For a generous contribution in his name, the God of Mercy, Charity, and Justice will grant you the power to revisit your choices regarding Skills.
